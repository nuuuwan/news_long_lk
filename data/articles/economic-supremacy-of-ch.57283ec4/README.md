The next step would be to find ways to supremacy and dominate at the world stage

The emergence of China (ROC) as a market economy, leaving behind bamboo curtains and out from the totalitarian dictatorship regime, had been welcomed by US and Westerners at large in early 1989. The transformation to a market economy had shifted the world opinion from human rights perspective to socio-economic liberalisation, where it would lead to political and personal liberalisation. At the outset, the move was seen primarily as a one-way flow of ideas and goods into China transforming the life in China. Despite welcoming by the West, the expectations were optimistic and mixed and created to rethink, and most importantly the impact on the world.

It was widely reported in the international media, the brewing conflict between US and China centred on Taiwan. Before reading between the lines, it is relevant and appropriate to look back and understand Chinese elevation as a world super power within a couple of decades. The writer believes that the strength gained through economic and financial prosperity led to build the pathway for supremacy.

In mid to late 1989, I had the opportunity to associate with Chinese engineers on various technical fora and also to visit China for a month-stay after the Tiananmen Square Massacre (TSM). What I experienced and gathered was a very bleak picture especially in the lives of ordinary citizens. A couple of engineers asked me whether Sri Lanka Telecom could organise short-term consultancy assignments either through ITU or APT to earn a bit of foreign exchange towards improving living conditions. Most of them were living in tiny apartments where families had to manage available space with difficulty in cramped houses.

While staying in Beijing China, I used cycling, the popular mode of transport amongst the Chinese for short-term commutes and exchanged USD at a higher rate to domestic Yuan for our expenses. It was not an unfamiliar scene to the current Sri Lanka situation where all the vehicular traffic was parked clearing roadway for the movement of top brass of China.

Nevertheless, reforms were aimed for liberalisation of market economy, announced prior to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, had turned into a one-way street post-TSM era. Later refocused and developed the pathway to supremacy through trade and becoming a leading trading partner across many continents. This led to capture traditional markets, YoY (Year-on-Year) growth of trade surpluses, and foreign exchange reserves despite minor fluctuations recently experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On scrutinising the key economic indices, such as Balance of Trade and Foreign Exchange Reserves and compare them with US and Euro union, it was clear how much of hard work China had pursued to capture and infiltrate into those markets; credit goes to the dedication and genuine hard work of Chinese folks, despite complaints of unethical practices. The massive growth of earnings has been strategically deployed to fund for development activities and build assets of several countries. By this way, China had managed to foot their presence in many countries and subsequently led to the Road and Belt initiative.

Performance statistics

Over the years since 1989, China has strengthened their economy challenging US, Euro block and the entire world in many fronts and simultaneously improving the key indices. The Chinese were able to navigate successfully the external turbulences cropped up as a result of the trade war with the West and its allies. Although, this was the case, the world had kept very close scrutiny on the Chinese and all of their activities.

It is interesting to observe the strong performance of China through the lens of economic progress over the past two decades and compare with the rest of leading countries. Figures 1-3 show three graphs captured from citation [4] for illustrations.

a) Economic growth and GDP (ref: Fig 1);

b) Growth of Balance of Trade (ref: Fig 2) and Foreign Reserves, YoY basis (ref: Fig 3);

c) Competitiveness of Chinese products and services offerings;

d) Lifting people out of poverty (steep rise in GDP per capita), recently has been seen the increase of Chinese tourist and visitors. On comparing with US, there was a steady growth of GDP per capita since year 2019;

e) Becoming a leading trading partner, export earnings growth with surplus as opposed to US trade deficit;

g) Inward FDIs, caused trade war between the West.

In addition, Chinese have gained bargaining power and influence in all United Nations activities, Security Council, WHO, etc.

The given graph was taken as an example to illustrate and compare the Balance of Trade (BoT) of China vs US. Prior to 1989 there was practically nil BoT in China and since then a gradual surge of surplus to the current level of $ 180.7 billion in Q4 of 2024 as opposed to the deficit recorded in $ 53 billion in Q1 2020, amid fall in exports while imports jumped to an all-time high. This is a worrying trend for US and a hard task to reverse as, it likely to affect countries in Asia and South East Asian region those who have high Chinese FDI instances.

To further consolidate the aforementioned argument in terms of outward FDIs, the following has been extracted from two websites illustrating the Sri Lankan perspective.

To provide context, in 2019, the value of cumulative Chinese infrastructure investment in Sri Lanka was equivalent to 14% of Sri Lanka’s GDP, surpassing India’s comparable $ 1.2 billion in investment (Chatham House, March 2020; Indian Ministry of External Affairs, September 2019). At the same time, Chinese imports to Sri Lanka have grown consistently since 2011, and in 2019 were roughly comparable with India’s (The Diplomat, August 1, 2019). In short, while Indian economic relations with Sri Lanka have either remained steady or weakened, trade, investment and foreign aid ties with China have grown rapidly in the last few decades.

Unprecedented levels of Chinese outward FDIs have been seen lately, especially for vulnerable economies in the guise of stimulating growth. Those countries are being indebted and trapped without any self-rescue; tangible homegrown schemes other than to be an indefinite beneficiary of China;

Predominant and well-orchestrated cyber-attacks launched from China – espionage;

Indebtedness is used as a launching pad in interfering with respective governments – e.g. Chinese government interfering with Sri Lanka to accept the substandard fertilise ship despite it was rejected by Sri Lankan agriculture authority;

Surrender assets to China at a marginally low cost in the event there is no foreseen Return on Investments. Failing to service loans taken at marginally high rate;

Physical control of critical assets and stamp the presence for future atrocities and adversities and counter any threats;

Violation of Intellectual Property Rights costing manufacturing industries of US and West;

No respect for Human Rights, Chinese administrations have stolen the basic rights of its people, become the right exercised by the administration. Whistle-blowers are bumped into oblivion safeguarding the interest of top few and the communist doctrine; and

Leveraging all above facts to build and enhance One Road One Belt (OROB) across many regions and continents. This has seen as Chinese Monroe Doctrine where it exercises Chinese colonisation, especially, in the Asian Block.

Warmongering attitude

Each country has its own policies and prerogative to protect their own interest, sometimes they may go against the wishes of another country. Lately, and in the recent past we have witnessed Chinese responses to that had gone against their expectations; retaliations in terms of, trade sanctions, destabilising financial markets by way of pulling out their investments, etc. China’s excellent financial performance over the years has made a platform for negative activities towards developed nations and also acting in disguise as a beneficiary for developing countries to spread their wings for their ulterior motives and achieve the goals.

Once, while addressing the nation, the Chinese president said, China will not tolerate bullying from any foreign forces, if so, quote: “bash heads bloody against great wall of steel” unquote. Such nationalist statements demonstrate the appetite for war with no hesitation of any consequences.

Military build-up in South China Sea

It apparent that Chinese are building up military capability in South China Sea to annex Taiwan to main land of China either by peaceful means or by invading. Chinese believe Taiwan historically a part of China and never believed declaration of independence after year 1949 Chinese civil war. However, Chinese are cautious of Americans support to Taiwan in the event of China opt to go for war.

It has been reported that Chinese military spending is unparalleled and alarming, modernising the capabilities and strengthen the presence by building artificial islands in the coast to the size of 1,300 hectares. Have also seen lately, testing ballistic and long-range missile by China. The satellite images show movement of heavy weaponry that includes development of, land, sea and air launched missiles to repel and possibly sink opposing vessels; expressed most emphatically by land-based DF-21D ballistic missiles also known as “carrier killer”

There are multiple views of this looming war, some believe US and its allies will defend in the event of invasion by China despite cost, to maintain the strategic credibility, the opposite view was, it is a dangerous ploy to go for military confrontation as nothing will be achieved rather than a human and economic catastrophe which might turn in to the WWIII of the century and ripples out to the entire world.

Why Taiwan is important to China

China believes that the domination and influence of West in the region as a threat to China’s progress, hence believe occupation of Taiwan is an effective solution considering:

a) Strategic geographical location of Taiwan where, China could threaten and target US with long range ballistic missiles in the event of conflict;

b) Curb strong diplomatic relationships with West and the test point for democracy in the face of Authoritarian – see as a threat;

c) Being a leading semiconductor manufacturer of lower end appliances to cutting edge weaponry which will further enhance the military capabilities;

d) Taiwan $ 577 billion Forex reserves, sixth largest in the world; and

e) As a first step to oust US out of Asia, progressively diminishing influence and domination.

When a country becomes wealthier, it undoubtedly gains strength to influence others in many ways; human rights, economic and financials, I believe, the next step would be to find ways to supremacy and dominate at the world stage. This has been seen in the past, emergence and shift the centre of power from country to country. In this era, we now witness Chinese emergence not in dissimilar manner to historical past. One could annex or strengthen their presence in other countries who have fallen victims or become beneficiaries due to their own misfortunes and mismanagement.

Sri Lanka is one of the nations who has played into their jaws and hanging on the crutches with restricted escape routes to resurrect from this misery. Chinese have strategically targeted Sri Lanka as a prime geographical location that suits for the OBOR initiative and one of the pivoted points of the sea route. With the strong influence and support of US and West allies towards Taiwan, China is unable to foot their presence without invading the island nation Taiwan which is also a pivotal point for the military operations.

It is very clear that China is looking for strategic points of the globe to flex their muscles and gain control and influence over other nations willing or unwillingly.

The Chinese President is in a collision course with his colleagues and its people, shielding all Western influences, banning boy-bands, computer games and apps, etc., and introducing to the school curriculum the communist doctrine and his thoughts thus indoctrinating the minds of children at young age. Freedom of speech and thought in defending democracy have been shut. It was said by an expert of geo-politics in Australia, the prime focus of China is to fulfil their goals at any cost and undeterrable.

With respect to potential conflict, I fervently believe Chinese will not back away but keep building military capacity in the South China Sea, either showing the strength of their capability to US and its allies or for arm conflict in spite of heavy price as always been. US policy towards Taiwan (which also calls itself the Republic of China or ROC) has long prioritised the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The United States supports Taiwan’s efforts to deter China from using force to gain control of the archipelago, which the PRC claims as its territory but has never controlled.

Was this an assurance in defending Taiwan’s sovereignty thus further provoking Chinese administration nonetheless, the treaty between them only stipulate to strengthen and enhance self-defence of Taiwan but no support for any arm conflict? Could this be changed with the new US President? Will the recent tariff revisions of imported goods to US fuel an arms conflict originating in the South China Sea?

Some analysts who have sympathised with China say it is better not to think China as an evil but explore avenues to obtain benefit from their developments viz: Technology, products and markets. However, over the past decades, China has not demonstrated its genuine motives for the development of mankind rather than to gain control over others when opportunity exists or harnessing opportunities to fulfil the goals and concur.

Is the countdown for military confrontation on? Yet to be watched the unfolding day by day developments in the region, we hope and pray this will not turn into a dirty bloody war of 21st century WWIII.
