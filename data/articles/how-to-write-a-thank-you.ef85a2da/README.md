You’ve updated your resume, written your cover letter, and prepared for your interview. Now it’s time for your thank you note to seal the deal. In this piece, the author outlines what to say — and not to say — in your thank you email to interviewers and answers...more

You’ve just finished an interview for a job opportunity you’re really excited about. You know you should send a thank-you note to your interviewers, but you’re not sure what to write. How much detail should you include? Should you send an email to every person you interviewed with? And what’s really the best way to follow up?

Here’s some advice on what to say — and not to say — in your message, along with sample email templates. I’ll also cover why writing a thoughtful and professional thank-you note is something you should do, even if it feels like a formality. Let’s start with what to write in your email.

How to Write a Thank-You Email After an Interview

Your email should be short, sincere, and sent within 24 hours of your interview. Here are a few key components you should include in your message.

1. Be thoughtful about how you address your email — and who you send it to.

Address the email to the person who interviewed you and make sure you spell their name correctly. If their name is Christopher and they asked you to call them Chris in the interview, address them as such in your follow-up. If you interviewed with multiple people, it’s good practice to send each person a brief message.

2. Match the tone and formality of the communicator.

A simple way to demonstrate your attention to detail is to match the interviewer’s professionalism and communication style. Review past exchanges to see if they started their messages “Dear” or “Hi,” and if their email signature closed with “Best regards” or “Thanks.”

Look at past emails and review their writing style and match the tone in your response. Just like going to an interview, it is always better to be a little overdressed than underdressed.

3. Thank the person for their time and consideration.

Expressing your appreciation for people’s time signals self-awareness and thoughtfulness, two characteristics that will be highly valued by most hiring managers. You may say something like, “I know you are busy, and I just want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me today.”

4. Briefly highlight your draw to the organization.

David Lancefield, a former partner at PwC and now CEO coach, suggests that candidates “call out an aspect of the conversation that was particularly interesting or share a helpful hook to help them remember what you spoke about.” You may say something like, “I really enjoyed talking about X” and add something that would be unique to your interview, like “talking about environmental policy,” “hearing about your love of travel,” or “discussing how to use design thinking to improve processes.” Share something that brings them back to your conversation together.

5. Express your continued interest in the job opportunity.

Make your interest and excitement explicit. Hiring managers know people are often applying for multiple jobs and don’t want to waste time on candidates who are not genuinely interested. So make it clear by saying something like, “I am excited about the possibility of joining your team and being able to work side by side to accomplish X.” If you can do it succinctly, share why: “I am confident my experience would add value to your clients, and personally, I know X is the perfect place for me to continue to grow.”

6. Offer to answer any questions.

Picking the right candidate isn’t easy, so let the hiring manager know you’re there to answer questions and address any concerns they may have. You can say something like, “I know that picking the right person for your team is not easy, so if you have any questions or concerns, know I am here to address them.”

Lourdes Olvera-Marshall, who teaches networking and career management courses at NYU, recommends jotting down quick notes when you’re interviewing. Write down your interviewer’s name, what you discuss, and a few keywords to trigger your memory, so you can make your follow-up message more meaningful. As she told me, “The thank-you note starts during the interview.”

What to Avoid in Your Thank-You Email

If you don’t want to leave the interviewers with a bad impression, avoid these three common mistakes.

Mistake #1: Adding too much detail

Remember that the intention of the message is to say thank you, not to pick up where your interview left off. “Your follow-up is not the place to add all the things you wish you had highlighted in your interview,” Olvera-Marshall warns. When you do, you run the risk of appearing desperate or like you weren’t prepared for the interview.

Mistake #2: Making requests

People are busy. Avoid requesting anything that creates additional work. You want to show your interviewer that you’re easy to work with.

Mistake #3: Overlooking typos

And of course, don’t forget to review your email for grammar and spelling before sending. This is an example of your communication, and you don’t want it to reflect poorly on your attention to detail.

Why Is It Important to Send a Thank You Note?

Beyond it being a nice gesture, there are multiple benefits to sending a follow-up message after an interview.

It creates a positive connection with the interviewer(s).

No matter how well your interview went, many hiring managers squeeze multiple interviews into their busy schedules. A thoughtful message helps you leave a lasting positive impression after the interview is over.

It helps you stand out from the crowd.

Investing the time to send a thank you increases your chances of standing out from other applicants. One study found that only one out of four candidates sent thank you messages after their interviews, yet 80% of HR managers said those messages were helpful when reviewing candidates.

It’s an opportunity to demonstrate your professionalism and people skills.

It’s one thing to tell an interviewer you’re detail-oriented and work well with others — it’s another to show them. A well-crafted and timed thank you message illustrates your follow-up, your ability to capture the meeting’s essence in writing, and that you understand the importance of expressing your appreciation for others.

It confirms your interest in the job.

Hiring managers understand that candidates may be interviewing for multiple jobs at the same time. Busy themselves, leaders don’t want to invest time in a candidate who is not invested in the role they’re hiring for. An appreciative email confirms that you’re interested, excited about the role, and worth following up with.

You may send your message and get a response in minutes, or you may never hear back at all. Either way, investing 15 minutes to express your appreciation may be the difference between getting the job or getting lost in the crowd.
