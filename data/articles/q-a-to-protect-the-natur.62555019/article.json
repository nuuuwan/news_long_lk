Kapnick highlights the critical role of accurate environmental measurement in aiding businesses to understand their impacts, create new financial instruments, and enhance risk management. She discusses NOAA\u2019s efforts to bridge the gap between scientific research and practical applications, the importance of international cooperation, and the growing involvement of the private sector in environmental monitoring.",
