The new government took power scarcely a month ago. So far mainstream media has refrained from harsh criticism of the regime. Perhaps, a hang-over of past government’s antagonism toward the media. Or, perhaps it is because of the fact in our country the media does not immediately criticise incoming regimes..

Whatever the reason, the media has been extremely sensitive not to ruffle the feathers of the regime. Perhaps memories of a by-gone era, where voices of dissent, were stilled out-of-hand, permeates the Fourth Estate.

The silencing of the late Lasantha Wickramatunge, the late Taraki (SR) and the late Vijaya Kumaratunga to name a few, come to mind. The entire list is too long to be carried in this column.

The present JVP/NPP government portrays itself as being squeaky clean. Largely the media has played ball without raising too many questions. Yesterday though, our sister paper the ‘Sunday Times’ highlighted a case of a recently appointed Deputy Minister who is the subject of an ongoing police fraud investigation.

While the charge could be fraudulent, the norm in a Democratic society is that such persons do not accept posts of responsibility until their name/s are cleared. Sadly, such niceties -political or otherwise- have not been part of politicians who graced the legislature of this country. Yet, the fact remains, the people of this country voted our present rulers into power on the basis of the anti corruption platform they campaigned on.

While making no judgement either on the Deputy Minister or those responsible for his appointment, it does not reflect well on the newly elected regime. The governing party has also appointed to parliament politicians who were rejected at the polls, to its National List... Mama Mia!

It has become standard practice since the ‘National List’ entered our political milieu, for political parties whose nominees were rejected by the voters at the polls, to reappoint the same members, enabling them to creep back into parliament despite voter rejection.

After the last General Elections, the United National Party (UNP), the Democratic National Front (DNF) and Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa’s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), have all been backed into a tight corner by politicians rejected by the people attempting to creep into parliament by the back door so-to-say.

Former President Wickremesinghe who heads both the UNP and the DNF, saw to his consternation, candidate Ravi Karunanayake -was allegedly  accused of corrupt practices- and member of both political parties, creep into Parliament via the National List without Wickremesinghe’s knowledge.

Namal Rajapaksa, son of former Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, having correctly recognised his unelectability, opted to refrain facing the polls. He has gained entry into parliament via the National List.

The NPP too has appointed two of its nominees who were rejected by voters to its National List. Here however, the party has indicated they were members of minority interests.

At this point one has to raise his/her hat to former MP M.A. Sumanthiran who refused to accept a slot from the National List of his party the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kathchi (ITAK) on the ground that he was rejected by the people.

The ‘National List’ -a creation of the J.R Jayawardene Constitution- was supposed to bring into parliament minority interests who were not adequately represented in the House. Unfortunately today the ‘National List’ has become a route for parliamentarians rejected by the people to creep into that august body through the back door.

Unless used in the spirit of the Constitution, the National List is redundant. It needs be redefined and tightened.

The present regime, though not specifically mentioning the need to change the Constitution in its manifesto, speaks of the need for Constitutional changes. Redefining the criteria for selection/appointment of ‘National List’ members is one such area.

In its election manifesto the JVP/NPP combine have pointed out areas drastically in need of correction. The question is, whether the JVP/NPP coalition has the political will to live up to its pre-election promises. Or they will they, like their predecessors, drop it like a hot potatoe. Only time will tell.
