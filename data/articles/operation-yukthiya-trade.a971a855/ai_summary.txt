1. 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka’s ‘Yukthiya’ operation, led by Minister of Public Affairs Tiran Alles, is a war against drugs and the underworld, aiming to free Sri Lanka from these issues by 2025. 
2. 💵 This operation has been criticized as a political maneuver by critics, particularly after a local businessman was murdered by two gunmen. 
3. 🗣️ Alles and President Ranil Wickremesinghe have drawn criticism for their statements advocating for the police to “use their guns for the right cause” and implying that some human rights lawyers represent drug-related criminals.

5. 🚔 The ‘Yukthiya’ initiative was launched in 2023 to fight drug prevalence and rising crime rates, particularly among young people and within schools. 
6. 🕴️ This is not the first anti-drug operation in Sri Lanka, with similar initiatives having been launched by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena before it.
7. 👮 Following a high-profile shooting, calls have been made for an assertive crackdown on criminal underworld networks, further blurring the boundaries between law and order and justice.
8. ⚖️ This appeal for extrajudicial police action in the anti-drug campaign ironically mirrors the operation’s name 'Yukthiya', or ‘justice,' implying that justice should be brought about by the police.
9. 👥 Trade unions strikes and actions are now being hit with these new aggressive tactics, being described as anti-stabilising and a threat to economic reform efforts.
