    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that its Executive Board approved a $ 3 billion financing for Sri Lanka for the next four years while approving an extended fund facility. The IMF also stressed the increasing tax revenue in next decades. Therefore collecting more revenue and strengthening tax administration is the utmost objective of our country. In order to achieve high resources, the tax administration needs public confidence in their duties. The public also needs a fair, equitable, transparent and accountable tax system that aims at implementing good tax principles",
    "There are two certain things with regard to nature in the world. They are Death and Tax. Taxes are the most important source of revenue of the modern Government. It plays a vital role in fulfilling peoples\u2019 aspirations and their rights. Taxation is not a new concept in the modern world. It is as old as the first attempt of mankind to organise a civilised society.",
    "The most famous books on Finance in our history is \u2018Kautilya Arthashastra, The Wealth of Nation\u2019 by Adam Smith giving classic examples of the world financial system in the ancient era. The taxation comes from the Latin word \u201ctaxo\u201d which means censure, charge, compute, rate, appropriate, estimate, etc. According to the Oxford Dictionary, tax is a compulsory contribution to State revenue levied by the Government. Therefore, whether we like it or not we have to pay it to the Government.",
    "Today, the citizens of every country believe that they will be provided goods and services, law and order, healthcare facilities, education, infrastructure, facilities, etc., which will be maintained by the Government. They also think that these are the main components of Government in governing any country whether developed or not. In order to fulfil these things, any Government needs revenue. Revenue comes as a tax, non-tax, charges, levy, loan, etc. Therefore, taxation helps in many ways in making people happiest with wealth in a country. If we use peoples\u2019 revenue for the people in a better way with accountability and transparency, it is the utmost goal of the taxation. If they allocate this revenue in a proper way, with accountability and transparency, the country will become a better place.",
    "Tax system in ancient Sri Lanka",
    "Historical records, inscriptions and ancient literature provide us with advanced information regarding an organised tax system prevailing from the time Before Christ (BC) up to the introduction of the modern tax system in the country. The Galapatha Vihara inscription of Dambadeniya Era, Gadaladeniya inscription, Saman Devala Sannasa are some of them which show the ancient tax system in Ceylon. Not only inscriptions, but also valuable books written during that period clearly mentioned how they collected taxes at that time. \u201cBuduguna Alankaraya\u201d which was composed during the Kotte Era reminded people of the manner of collecting taxes without harassing the citizens. The following verse gives evidence for how the tax system is convenient for taxpayers: \u201cRon Aragena Semin, Yana Bigun Lesin kusumin, lowata Duk Nodemin, Ganithi Aya Panduru Pera Niyamin\u201d.",
    "The Kavyashekaraya, Rajawaliya, Pujawaliya and many other historical books have shown the real pictures of tax administration and how kings developed the country by utilising taxes collected from the people on behalf of the citizens and others. During the period of King Nissankamalla of Polonnaruwa, orders were given to cancel some taxes which had been imposed in an arbitrary way. The king also had a clear view on some assessing system of taxes and introduced some fair tax system to the country.",
    "Imposing Coconut Tax which came into operation in September 1896 was purely based on expanding tea industries at that time.

The firearm tax was another tax which was introduced by the British as a protective strategy in order to protect wild animals and set free cultivations from elephants. 2 shillings and 3 pence were to be paid annually as firearm tax. The then British governors had to abolish the firearm tax which was one of the major reasons behind the 1848 rebellion due to a strong protest of the public. This tax was abolished on the recommendations of a commission which consisted of an officer called Beili who enquired reasons for this rebellion.",
    "In the analysis of the tax pattern in the world history, income tax was first introduced in 1799 as a remedy to get rid of the threats of the French Emperor Napoleon in 1804, to uplift the British economy which subjected to degradation in the last decade of 1700 and to gain profits to the Government from the rich who lived during that period and it was gradually spread to other countries as well. Later, British emperors considered increasing their revenue immediately in accordance with the existing expenditure pattern in order to expedite their process of colonialism and to get rid of the other countries which are involved in invasions.",
