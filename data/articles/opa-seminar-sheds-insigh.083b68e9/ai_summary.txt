Dr. Sarath Rathnayake concentrated on dementia, emphasising the importance of a healthy lifestyle to prevent its onset. Dr. Sanath Hettige described ways to slow the biological aging process, including maintaining a balanced diet, early detection of illnesses and incorporating regular moderate exercise into daily routines.
