    "Productive failure drives employee learning and growth by embedding failure into learning tasks, for example by using constraints, comparing approaches, or creating uncertainty. The next crucial step is to assemble the failures into valuable learning through a feedback and assembly process. This involves not just analyzing what went wrong, but also contrasting novice-level solutions with expert solutions to highlight the deeper reasons for failure. The productive failure approach creates opportunities for team exploration, learning, and long-term success.",
    "Failure is often viewed as something you need to avoid, especially by new managers who are eager to prove their competence or have been previously conditioned to think that way. But failure isn\u2019t a bad thing. In fact, it can help in fostering your team\u2019s long-term sustainable development.",
