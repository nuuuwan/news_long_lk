Torrential rain and floods due to climate change have affected Sri Lanka, while its government has been focused on pending elections. The UN underlines the importance of environmental preservation, with World Environment Day annually falling on June 5. The day emphasizes the protection of global ecosystems, and the UN stated that up to 40% of the world's land is degraded, impacting half of the global population. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) is a significant push for land restoration and battling desertification. At the heart of this year's environmental campaign is the slogan "Our land. Our future. We are #GenerationRestoration," emphasizing the need to restore lands, regrow forests, and revive water sources. The 30th anniversary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification will be marked in 2024, and a conference will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Amid the climate crisis, the UN stresses the importance of quick action to limit global warming to below 1.5Â°C.
