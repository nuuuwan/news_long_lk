# AI Success Depends on Tackling ‚ÄúProcess Debt‚Äù

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- Organizations involved in transformation efforts often deal with "technical debt," a consequence of years of short-term decisions leading to complex technological architecture.
- "Process debt" is a similar issue facing organizations, referring to outdated, functionally isolate, and customer-disconnected ways of operation.
- Remapping and prioritizing how an organization does work can lead to significant improvements. 
- AI brings potential to help transform how work is done and access work previously thought unachievable.
- Emergency Room doctors average 4,000 keystrokes in a ten-hour shift, indicating a part of work that could potentially be automated or improved.
 
Opinions:
- Without addressing process debt, companies won't be able to fully utilize technologies like AI.
- AI not only has the capacity to replace some work but can also augment intelligence to improve effectiveness and speed. 
- Remapping and reprioritizing an organization's workflow can greatly improve focus on tasks better suited to the organization.

Typically, organizations in the midst of transformation efforts spend significant time and resources trying to correct massive amounts of ‚Äútechnical debt‚Äù ‚Äî the price of years of short-term decisions and prioritizations that result in an overly complex technological infrastructure. But equally challenging is managing organizations‚Äô often undiscussed ‚Äúprocess debt‚Äù ‚Äî the build-up of often antiquated, functionally isolated, and customer-disconnected ways of doing work. Without tackling process debt, companies won‚Äôt be able to realize the massive potential of technologies like AI. Remapping and reprioritizing how your organization does work can lead to startling results and focus your organization on the activities it‚Äôs better equipped to deliver.

Much like the many digitization efforts that have come before, AI brings tremendous potential to help transform how work is done, and even access work that we didn‚Äôt think was possible.¬†Consider that ER doctors hit an average of 4,000 keystrokes in a 10-hour shift ‚Äî imagine all the good that could be accomplished from repurposing that effort, time, and mental energy by not just replacing some of this work, but also augmenting intelligence to help improve effectiveness and speed.
