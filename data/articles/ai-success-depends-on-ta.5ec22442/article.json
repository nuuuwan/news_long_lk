    "Typically, organizations in the midst of transformation efforts spend significant time and resources trying to correct massive amounts of \u201ctechnical debt\u201d \u2014 the price of years of short-term decisions and prioritizations that result in an overly complex technological infrastructure. But equally challenging is managing organizations\u2019 often undiscussed \u201cprocess debt\u201d \u2014 the build-up of often antiquated, functionally isolated, and customer-disconnected ways of doing work. Without tackling process debt, companies won\u2019t be able to realize the massive potential of technologies like AI. Remapping and reprioritizing how your organization does work can lead to startling results and focus your organization on the activities it\u2019s better equipped to deliver.",
    "Much like the many digitization efforts that have come before, AI brings tremendous potential to help transform how work is done, and even access work that we didn\u2019t think was possible.\u00a0Consider that ER doctors hit an average of 4,000 keystrokes in a 10-hour shift \u2014 imagine all the good that could be accomplished from repurposing that effort, time, and mental energy by not just replacing some of this work, but also augmenting intelligence to help improve effectiveness and speed.",
