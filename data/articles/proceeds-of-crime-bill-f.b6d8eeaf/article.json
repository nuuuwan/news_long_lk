    "If no financial crimes are committed there will be no need for such a law to deal with the proceeds of crime",
    "\u2018For whom the bell tolls\u2019 is a novel by Ernest Hemingway published in 1940. It is widely believed that the title was derived from a poem written by John Donne (1572-1631), an English poet and dean of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Donne argues that the tolling of church bells, which signified the death of another human life, is a toll for each of us, as we are all bound together. In an article that appeared many years ago on the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime legislation in another jurisdiction, the author had used the title because of the wide ranging scope of the law for culprits it means virtual death. Losing almost all the ill-gotten wealth is good enough to trigger a fatal heart attack,",
    "Apart from a few statutes such as the Penal Code and Civil Procedure Code, the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill is one of the longest statutes in Sri Lanka. The bill that was published in the Gazette Supplement of 21 February 2025 runs into 227 A4 size pages with 151 clauses. It was drafted by an expert committee headed by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda P.C. The enactment of the Bill into an Act of Parliament is an IMF imposed condition.",
    "In the evolution of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing and anti-corruption legal regimes, the enactment of a law on the seizure and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime is more or less a response to the ineffectiveness of other measures of such laws to deter financial crimes as well as regulatory and compliance requirements such as Know Your Customer and Due Diligence.",
    "The rationale underlining the Bill is set out in the Preamble to the Bill:",

    "AND WHEREAS for the purpose of realizing the objectives of this Act, it is necessary to vest duties and responsibilities on certain law enforcement officers and to suitably empower them to perform such duties and responsibilities, and also to establish certain statutory bodies including the Proceeds of Crime Management Authority:",
    "In the evolution of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing and anti-corruption legal regimes, the enactment of a law on the seizure and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime is more or less a response to the ineffectiveness of other measures of such laws to deter financial crimes as well as regulatory and compliance requirements such as Know Your Customer and Due Diligence",
    "AND WHEREAS it is necessary to provide for a legislative mechanism to enable law enforcement authorities of Sri Lanka to cooperate with law enforcement, administrative and judicial authorities of other countries with regard to proceeds of crime located both within and outside Sri Lanka, and to cause the return to Sri Lanka or repatriate from Sri Lanka such proceeds of crime or value thereof to those who are legitimately entitled to such property:",
    "AND WHEREAS it is necessary to provide restitution and repatriation to victims of crime and to the community or the general public who have been affected by unlawful activities, and for such purpose provide for the creation and establishment of the Victims of Crime Reparation Trust Fund:",
    "AND WHEREAS it is also necessary to give full effect to Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, and the United Nations Convention Against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance and to enact legislation relating to proceeds of crime, compatible with contemporary international norms and best practices\u2026",

    "There will be a separate Trust Fund to provide for restitution and reparation to victims of crime (Victims of Crime Reparation Trust Fund)",
    "Institution of legal proceedings",
    "In a short article of this nature, justice cannot be done to the technical procedures set out in the Bill in greater detail.",
    "Where the committing of an unlawful activity has been investigated into and the suspected perpetrator prosecuted for having committed the relevant unlawful activity and he has been convicted of having committed such unlawful activity, proceedings which shall be referred to as post-conviction forfeiture proceedings may thereafter be instituted for \u2013",
    "(a) the forfeiture of proceeds of such unlawful activity which has been frozen; or",
    "(b) the corresponding value of the proceeds of crime to be recovered and forfeited.",
    "(2) Such proceedings can be instituted \u2013",

    "Provided however, an order for payment for a penalty as provided above cannot be made if the unlawful activity had been committed prior to the date of the coming into operation of this Bill/Act.",
    "There are several clauses that deal with non-conviction based proceedings, namely where a property suspected to be proceeds of crime has been investigated into and material collected to establish prima-facie that such property is proceeds of crime, and such property has been either restrained or seized and thereafter frozen in terms of this Act, civil proceedings may be thereafter instituted in the High Court in terms of this Bill, against such property, for the forfeiture of such property suspected to be proceeds of crime as provided in this Act. Such civil judicial proceedings are referred to as non conviction based forfeiture proceedings.",

    "This Bill is highly technical in nature; however, given the scope of the subject-matter this was a necessity and the experts have done an admirable job in trying their best to demystify some of the concepts. There are several innovative measures in the Bill, compared with relevant laws in a few other jurisdictions. It will require a considerable amount of time and resources to make the legislation fully operational with trained Judges and officers. Integrity has to be in the genetic make up of those entrusted with the wide ranging statutory powers. The legal profession must extend their fullest cooperation to make this legislation to be successfully implemented rather than viewing it as a means of a new \u2018gold mine\u2019.",
    "Corporate vigilance key to avoiding criminal proceeds in company accounts",
    "Corporations and financial sector organisations must exercise heightened vigilance to ensure they do not unknowingly become entangled in activities involving criminal proceeds, which could inadvertently appear in their financial records. Such involvement, even if unintentional, could lead to severe repercussions not only for the organisations but also for their directors and staff, as stipulated by the relevant legislation. The penalties under this act are stringent, emphasising the necessity for rigorous adherence to compliance protocols. By maintaining robust preventive measures, organisations can effectively safeguard against the infiltration of illicit funds into their accounts. Directors and partners of partnerships need to be aware that they are equally liable (subject to some exceptions) if the corporate entity or one partner has committed an offence.",
    "If no financial crimes are committed there will be no need for such a law to deal with the proceeds of crime. This should be one of the ultimate goals of the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 endeavour.",
