Sudath Mahadivulwewa's film "My Red Comrade", now in cinemas, is political and experimental and explores issues including climate change and inequitable social systems. The film is set in a one-bedroom house and examines the nature of revolution through the dialogue of its two main characters. Using the native American fable about a wolf as a metaphor, the film focuses on what elements of our society and upbringing we should embrace or reject. It's seen as a critical contribution to cinema and has been praised for its realism, direction, script, sound and lighting.
