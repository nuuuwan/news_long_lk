    "A short ferry ride from the port city of Yantai, on the northeast coast of China, sits Genghai No.\u00a01, a 12,000-metric-ton ring of oil-rig-style steel platforms, advertised as a hotel and entertainment complex. On arrival, visitors step onto docks and climb up to reach a strange offshore facility\u2014half cruise ship, half high-tech laboratory, all laid out around half a mile of floating walkways. Its highest point\u2014the \u201cglistening diamond\u201d on Genghai No.\u00a01\u2019s necklace, according to China\u2019s state news agency\u2014is a seven-\u00adstory visitor center, designed to look like a cartoon starfish. \u00a0 Jack Klumpp, a YouTuber from Florida, became one of the first 20,000 tourists to explore Genghai\u2019s visitor center following its opening in May 2023. In his series I\u2019m in China with Jack, Klumpp strolls around a water park cutely decorated in Fisher-Price yellow and turquoise, and indoors, he is excited to spot the hull of China\u2019s deep-sea submersible Jiaolong. In reality, the sea here is only about 10 meters deep, and the submersible is only a model. Its journey into the ocean\u2019s depths is an immersive digital experience rather than real adventure, but the floor of the sub rocks and shakes under his feet like a theme park ride.\u00a0 Related StoryWhy it\u2019s so hard for China\u2019s chip industry to become self-sufficientChip companies from the US and China are developing new materials to reduce reliance on a Japanese monopoly.

    "Watching Klumpp lounge in Genghai\u2019s luxe marine hotel, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would build this tourist attraction on an offshore rig, nearly a mile out in the Bohai Strait. But the answer is at the other end of the walkway from Genghai\u2019s tourist center, where on a smaller, more workmanlike platform, he\u2019s taught how to cast a worm-baited line over the edge and reel in a hefty bream.\u00a0 Genghai is in fact an unusual tourist destination, one that breeds 200,000 \u201chigh-quality marine fish\u201d each year, according to a recent interview in China Daily with Jin Haifeng, deputy general manager of Genghai Technology Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned shipbuilder Shandong Marine Group. Just a handful of them are caught by recreational fishers like Klumpp. The vast majority are released into the ocean as part of a process known as marine ranching.\u00a0 Advertisement Since 2015, China has built 169 \u201cnational demonstration ranches\u201d\u2014including Genghai No. 1\u2014and scores of smaller-scale facilities, which collectively have laid 67 million cubic meters of artificial reefs and planted an area the size of Manhattan with seagrass, while releasing at least 167 billion juvenile fish and shellfish into the ocean. The Chinese government sees this work as an urgent and necessary response to the bleak reality that fisheries are collapsing both in China and worldwide, with catches off China\u2019s coast declining 18% in less than a decade. In the face of that decline, marine ranches could offer an enticing win-win: a way to restore wild marine ecosystems while boosting fishery hauls.",
    "Marine ranches could offer an enticing win-win: a way to restore wild marine ecosystems while boosting fishery hauls. But before China invests billions more dollars into these projects, it must show it can get the basics right.  Genghai, which translates as \u201cSea Harvest,\u201d sits atop what Jin calls an \u201cundersea ecological oasis\u201d constructed by developers. In the middle of the circular walkway, artificial marine habitats harbor shrimp, seaweed, and fish, including the boggle-eyed Korean rockfish and a fish with a parrot-like beak, known as the spotted knifejaw. The facility is a next-generation showcase for the country\u2019s ambitious plans, which call for 200 pilot projects by 2025. It\u2019s a 5G-enabled, AI-equipped \u201cecological\u201d ranch that features submarine robots for underwater patrols and \u201cintelligent breeding cages\u201d that collect environmental data in near-real time to optimize breeding by, for example, feeding fish automatically.",
    "In an article published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China\u2019s top science institute, one high-ranking fisheries expert sketches out plans for a seductive tech-driven future where production and conservation go hand in hand: Ecological ranches ring the coastline, seagrass meadows and coral reefs regrow around them, and autonomous robots sustainably harvest mature seafood.\u00a0 But now, Chinese researchers say, is the time to take stock of lessons learned from the rapid rollout of ranching to date. Before the country invests billions more dollars into similar projects in the coming years, it must show it can get the basics right.  What, exactly, is a marine ranch?\u00a0 Developing nations have historically faced a trade-off between plundering marine resources for development and protecting ecosystems for future generations, says Cao Ling, a professor at Xiamen University in eastern China. When growing countries take more than natural ecosystems can replenish, measures like seasonal fishing bans have been the traditional way to allow fisheries to recover. Marine ranching offers an alternative to restricting fishing\u2014a way to \u201creally synergize environmental, economic, and social development goals,\u201d says Cao\u2014by actively increasing the ocean\u2019s bounty.\u00a0 It\u2019s now a \u201chot topic\u201d in China, says Cao, who grew up on her family\u2019s fish farm before conducting research at the University of Michigan and Stanford. In fact, \u201cmarine ranching\u201d has become such a buzzword that it can be hard to tell what it actually means, encompassing as it does flagship facilities like Genghai No.\u00a01 (which merge scientific research with industrial-scale aquaculture pens, recreational fishing amenities, and offshore power) and a baffling array of structures including deep-sea floating wind farms with massive fish-farming cages and 100,000-ton \u201cmobile marine ranches\u201d\u2014effectively fish-breeding aircraft carriers. There are even whole islands, like the butterfly-shaped Wuzhizhou on China\u2019s tropical south coast, that have been designated as ranching areas.\u00a0  A scuba diver finishes cleaning the nets surrounding Genghai No. 1, China\u2019s first AI-powered \u201cecological\u201d marine ranch complex.UPI/ALAMY LIVE NEWS   To understand what a marine ranch is, it\u2019s easiest to come back to the practice\u2019s roots. In the early 1970s, California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska passed laws to allow construction of facilities aimed at repairing stocks of salmon after the rivers where they traditionally bred had been decimated by pollution and hydroelectric dams. The idea was essentially twofold: to breed fish in captivity and to introduce them into safe nurseries in the Pacific. Since 1974, when the first marine ranches in the US were built off the coast of California and Oregon, ranchers have constructed artificial habitats, usually concrete reef structures, that proponents hoped could provide nursery grounds where both valuable commercial stocks and endangered marine species could be restored.  Today, fish farming is a $200 billion industry that has had a catastrophic environmental impact, blighting coastal waters with streams of fish feces, pathogens, and parasites.  Marine ranching has rarely come close to fulfilling this potential. Eight of the 11 ranches that opened in the US in the 1970s were reportedly shuttered by 1990, their private investors having struggled to turn a profit. Meanwhile, European nations like Norway spent big on attempts to restock commercially valuable species like cod before abandoning the efforts because so few introduced fish survived in the wild. Japan, which has more ranches than any other country, made big profits with scallop ranching. But a long-term analysis of Japan\u2019s policies estimated that all other schemes involving restocking the ocean were unprofitable. Worse, it found, releasing docile, lab-bred fish into the wild could introduce genetically damaging traits into the original population.",
    "Advertisement Today, marine ranching is often considered a weird offshoot of conventional fish farming, in which fish of a single species are fed intensively in small, enclosed pens. This type of feedlot-style aquaculture has grown massively in the last half-century. Today it\u2019s a $200 billion industry and has had a catastrophic environmental impact, blighting coastal waters with streams of fish feces, pathogens, and parasites.\u00a0 Yet coastal nations have not been discouraged by the mediocre results of marine ranching. Many governments, especially in East Asia, see releasing millions of young fish as a cheap way for governments to show their support for hard-hit fishing communities, whose livelihoods are vanishing as fisheries teeter on the edge of collapse. At least 20 countries continue to experiment with diverse combinations of restocking and habitat enhancement\u2014including efforts to transplant coral, reforest mangroves, and sow seagrass meadows.\u00a0 Each year at least 26 billion juvenile fish and shellfish, from 180 species, are deliberately released into the world\u2019s oceans\u2014three for every person on the planet. Taken collectively, these efforts amount to a great, ongoing, and little-noticed experiment on the wild marine biome. China\u2019s big bet China, with a population of 1.4 billion people, is the world\u2019s undisputed fish superpower, home to the largest fishing fleet and more than half the planet\u2019s fish farms. The country also overwhelms all others in fish consumption, using as much as the four next-largest consumers\u2014the US, the European Union, Japan, and India\u2014combined and then doubled. But decades of overfishing, compounded by runaway pollution from industry and marine aquaculture, have left its coastal fisheries depleted.",
    "Around many Chinese coastal cities like Yantai, there is a feeling that things \u201ccould not be worse,\u201d says Yong Chen, a professor at Stony Brook University in New York. In the temperate northern fishing grounds of the Bohai and Yellow Seas, stocks of wild fish such as the large yellow croaker\u2014a species that\u2019s critically endangered\u2014have collapsed since the 1980s. By the turn of the millennium, the Bohai, a densely inhabited gulf 100 miles east of Beijing, had lost most of its large sea bass and croaker, leaving fishing communities to \u201cfish down\u201d the food chain. Fishing nets came up 91% lighter than they did in the 1950s, in no small part because heavy industry and this region\u2019s petrochemical plants had left the waters too dirty to support healthy fish populations. As a result, over the past three decades China has instituted some of the world\u2019s strictest seasonal fishing bans; recently it has even encouraged fishermen to find other jobs. But fish populations continue to decline, and fishing communities worry for their future.\u00a0 Marine ranching has received a big boost from the highest levels of government; it\u2019s considered an ideal test case for President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cecological civilization\u201d agenda, a strategy for environmentally sustainable long-term growth. Since 2015, ranching has been enshrined in successive Five-Year Plans, the country\u2019s top-level planning documents\u2014and ranch construction has been backed by an initial investment of \u00a511.9 billion ($1.8 billion). China is now on track to release 30 billion juvenile fish and shellfish annually by 2025.\u00a0 Related StoryWhat China\u2019s critical mineral ban means for the USThe nation has signaled it\u2019s prepared to hit back harder still, in ways that could inflict serious economic pain on its biggest economic rival.",
    "So far, the practice has produced an unlikely poster child: the sea cucumber. A spiky, bottom-dwelling animal that, like Japan\u2019s scallops, doesn\u2019t move far from release sites, it requires little effort for ranchers to recapture. Across northern China, sea cucumbers are immensely valuable. They are, in fact, one of the most expensive dishes on menus in Yantai, where they are served chopped and braised with scallions.",
    "Some ranches have experimented with raising multiple species, including profitable fish like sea bass and shellfish like shrimp and scallops, alongside the cucumber, which thrives in the waste that other species produce. In the northern areas of China, such as the Bohai, where the top priority is helping fishing communities recover, \u201ca very popular [mix] is sea cucumbers, abalone, and sea urchin,\u201d says Tian Tao, chief scientific research officer of the Liaoning Center for Marine Ranching Engineering and Science Research at Dalian Ocean University.\u00a0 Designing wild ecosystems\u00a0 Today, most ranches are geared toward enhancing fishing catches and have done little to deliver on ecological promises. According to Yang Hongsheng, a leading marine scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the mix of species that has so far been introduced has been \u201ctoo simple\u201d to produce a stable ecosystem, and ranch builders have paid \u201cinadequate attention\u201d to that goal.\u00a0 Advertisement Marine ranch construction is typically funded by grants of around \u00a520 million ($2.8 million) from China\u2019s government, but ranches are operated by private firms. These companies earn revenue by producing seafood but have increasingly cultivated other revenue streams, like tourism and recreational fishing, which has boomed in recent years. So far, this owner-\u00adoperator model has provided few incentives to look beyond proven methods that closely resemble aquaculture\u2014like Genghai No.\u00a01\u2019s enclosed deep-sea fishing cages\u2014and has done little to encourage contributions to ocean health beyond the ranch\u2019s footprint. \u201cMany of the companies just want to get the money from the government,\u201d says Zhongxin Wu, an associate professor at Dalian Ocean University who works with Tian Tao.\u00a0 Making ranches more sustainable and ecologically sound will require a rapid expansion of basic knowledge about poorly studied marine species, says Stony Brook\u2019s Yong Chen. \u201cFor a sea cucumber, the first thing you need to know is its life history, right? How they breed, how they live, how they die,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many key marine species, we have few ideas what temperature or conditions they prefer to breed and grow in.\u201d  A diver swims off the shore of Wuzhizhou Island, where fish populations multiplied tenfold after artificial reefs were introduced.YANG GUANYU/XINHUA/ALAMY   Chinese universities are world leaders in applied sciences, from agricultural research to materials science. But fundamental questions aren\u2019t always easy to answer in China\u2019s \u201cquite unique\u201d research and development environment, says Neil Loneragan, president of the Malaysia-based Asian Fisheries Society and a professor emeritus of marine science at Murdoch University in Australia.\u00a0 The central government\u2019s controlling influence on the development of ranching, Loneragan says, means researchers must walk a tightrope between their two bosses: the academic supervisor and the party chief. Marine biologists want to understand the basics, \u201cbut researchers would have to spin that so that it\u2019s demonstrating economic returns to industry and, hence, the benefits to the government from investment,\u201d he says.",
    "Many efforts aim to address known problems in the life cycles of captive-bred fish, such as inadequate breeding rates or the tough survival odds for young fish when they reach the ocean. Studies have shown that fish in these early life stages are particularly vulnerable to environmental fluctuations like storms and recent ocean heat waves.\u00a0 One of the most radical solutions, which Zhongxin Wu is testing, would improve their fitness before they\u2019re released from breeding tanks into the wild. Currently, Wu says, fish are simply scooped up in oxygenated plastic bags and turned loose in ocean nurseries, but there it becomes apparent that many are weak or lacking in survival skills. In response, his team is developing a set of \u201cwild training\u201d tools. \u201cThe main method is swimming training,\u201d he says. In effect, the juvenile fish are forced to swim against a current, on a sort of aquatic treadmill, to help acclimate them to the demands of the wild. Another technique, he says, involves changing the water temperature and introducing some other species to prepare them for seagrass and kelp forests they\u2019ll meet in the world outside.",
    "Wu says better methods of habitat enhancement have the greatest potential to increase the effectiveness of marine ranching. Today, most ranches create undersea environments using precast-con\u00adcrete structures that are installed under 20 meters of water, often with a rough surface to support the growth of coral or algae. The typical Chinese ranch aims for 30,000 cubic meters of artificial reefs; in the conservation-\u00adfocused ranching area around Wuzhizhou Island, for instance, 1,000 cast-concrete reef structures were dropped around the tropical island\u2019s shores. Fish populations have multiplied tenfold in the last decade.\u00a0 Related StoryThe great commercial takeover of low Earth orbitAxiom Space and other companies are betting they can build private structures to replace the International Space Station.",
    "This is by far the most expensive part of China\u2019s ranching program. According to a national evaluation coauthored by Cao Ling, 87% of China\u2019s first $1 billion investment has gone to construct artificial reefs, with a further 5% spent on seagrass and seaweed restoration. These costs have brought both questions about the effectiveness of the efforts and a drive for innovation. Across China, some initial signs suggest that the enhancements are making a difference: Sites with artificial reefs were found to have a richer mix of commercially important species and higher biomass than adjacent sites. But Tian and Wu are investigating new approaches, including custom 3D-printed structures for endangered fish. On trial are bungalow-\u00adsize steel ziggurats with wide openings for yellowtail kingfish\u2014a large, predatory fish that\u2019s prized for sashimi\u2014and arcs of barrel-\u00advaulted concrete, about waist height, for sea cucumbers. In recent years, structures have been specifically designed in the shape of pyramids, to divert ocean currents into oceanic \u201cupwellings.\u201d Nutrients that typically settle on the seafloor are instead ejected back up toward the surface. \u201cThat attracts prey for high-level predators,\u201d says Loneragan, including giant tuna-like species that fetch high prices at restaurants. Has China found a workable model? So will China soon be relying on\u00a0marine ranches to restock the seas? We still don\u2019t have anywhere near enough data to say. The Qingdao Marine Conservation Society, an environmental NGO, is one of the few independent organizations systematically assessing ranches\u2019 track records and has, says founder Songlin Wang, \u201cfailed to find sufficient independent and science-based research results that can measurably verify most marine ranches\u2019 expected or claimed environmental and social benefits.\u201d One answer to the data shortfall might be the kind of new tech on display at Genghai No. 1, where robotic patrols and subsea sensors feed immediately into a massive dashboard measuring water quality, changes in the ocean environment, and fish behavior. After decades as a fairly low-tech enterprise, ranching in China has been adopting such new technologies since the beginning of the latest Five-Year Plan in 2021. The innovations promise to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and make ranches more resilient to climate fluctuations and natural disasters, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\u00a0 AdvertisementBut Yong Chen, whose lab at Stony Brook partners with Chinese researchers, is skeptical that researchers are gathering and sharing the right data. \u201cThe problem is, yes, there\u2019s this visualization. So what?\u201d he says. \u201c[Marine ranching companies] are willing to invest money into this kind of infrastructure, create that kind of big screen, and people will walk in and say \u2018Wow, look at that!\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s beautiful. It definitely will impress the leadership. Important people will give you money for that. But as a scientist, my question to you is: How can it help you inform your decision-making process next year?\u201d\u00a0  Will China soon be relying on marine ranches to restock the seas? We still don\u2019t have anywhere near enough data to say.  \u201cData sharing is really difficult in China,\u201d says Cao Ling. Most data produced by private companies remains in their servers. But Cao and Chen say that governments\u2014local or central\u2014could facilitate more open data sharing in the interest of guiding ranch design and policy.\u00a0 But China\u2019s central government is convinced by what it has seen and plans to scale up investment. Tian, who leads the government committee on marine ranching, says he has recently learned that the next Ten-Year Plan will aim to increase the number of pilot ranches from 200 to 350 by 2035. Each one is expected to be backed by \u00a5200 million ($28 million)\u201410 times the typical current investment. Specific policies are due to be announced next year, but he expects that ranches will no longer be funded as standalone facilities. Instead, grants will likely be given to cities like Dalian and Yantai, which can plan across land and sea and find ways to link commercial fishing with power generation and tourism while cutting pollution from industry.\u00a0 Tian has an illustration that aims to visualize the coming tech-driven ecological ranching system, a sort of \u201cmarine ranching 3.0\u201d: a sea cove monitored by satellites and restored to such good health that orcas have returned to its fish-filled waters. It\u2019s a near-utopian image seemingly ripped from a 1960s issue of Popular Science. There\u2019s even stranger research that aims to see if red sea bream like the one Jack Klumpp caught can be conditioned like Pavlov\u2019s dogs\u2014in this case to flock to the sound of a horn, so the ocean\u2019s harvest would literally swim into nets at the press of a button.\u00a0 So far China\u2019s marine ranching program remains far from any of this, despite the isolated signs of success. But ultimately what matters most is to find a \u201cbalance point\u201d between commerce and sustainability, says Cao. Take Genghai No. 1: \u201cIt\u2019s very pretty!\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cAnd it costs a lot for the initial investment.\u201d If such ranches are going to contribute to China\u2019s coming \u201cecological civilization,\u201d they\u2019ll have to prove they are delivering real gains and not just sinking more resources into a dying ocean.\u00a0 Matthew Ponsford is a freelance reporter based in London."
