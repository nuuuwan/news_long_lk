Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has historically been popular among Tamil and Muslim voters. His support among these communities is critical as they comprise about 25.5% of the population, while Sinhalese form 74.9%. In 2020, the United National Party (UNP) led by Wickremesinghe suffered a significant electoral defeat partly due to a split with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa.

For the upcoming 2024 Presidential elections, Wickremesinghe plans to contest as a non-party independent candidate, backed by an alliance of various political groups and individuals rather than officially representing a single party. His support among Tamil and Muslim voters will be a key factor in his campaign.

The Ceylon Workers Congress (representing Hill Country Tamils) supports him. However, the Tamil People's Alliance (TPA), an alliance of multiple Tamil parties, remains with the SJB but has shown signs it could support Wickremesinghe. There is ongoing speculation that some TPA members may defect to supporting Wickremesinghe.

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and other Muslim parties such as the All Ceylon Makkal Congress and the National Congress are potential supporters. Individual Muslim MPs are also likely to back Wickremesinghe.

Among the Sri Lankan Tamils, Wickremesinghe has support from the EPDP, TMVP, and some other MPs. However, the main Tamil political configuration, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), is divided, and their support is uncertain.

Recent police actions against Tamil commemorations of the 2009 Mullivaaikkaal tragedy could negatively affect Wickremesingheâ€™s standing among Tamil voters. Despite these challenges, there remains optimism in the UNP that Wickremesinghe can appeal directly to Tamil voters and secure significant support from these communities in the upcoming election.
