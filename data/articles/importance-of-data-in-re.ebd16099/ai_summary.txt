Sri Lanka's industrial sector was responsible for 25% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, with just 6,000 entities accounting for 93% of industrial electricity use, according to the World Bank. To address this, the Sri Lankan government is using accurate data to understand where industrial energy comes from and which sectors emit most. As part of a five-year, EU-funded programme, several government ministries are being aided by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to fully comprehend the country's industrial energy use. The Central Environmental Authority also plans to adjust its application process so that companies must provide greenhouse gas-related data. Despite progress, certain data, such as the quantity and associated emissions of biomass use, is still missing.
