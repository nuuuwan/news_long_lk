    "Telling your boss that you\u2019re thinking about leaving isn\u2019t an easy conversation to have. How do you decide whether to even broach the topic? How do you frame the discussion? And how do you turn this possibly awkward and adversarial conversation into a...more",
    "It seems counterintuitive, but when you\u2019re thinking about quitting your job, your boss might be the best person to talk to \u2014 yes, your boss. After all, your boss knows your strengths, weaknesses, and your potential within the organization. An open conversation could lead to unexpected solutions. So, how do you decide whether to broach this topic? How do you frame the discussion? And how do you turn this possibly awkward and adversarial conversation into a productive dialogue?",
    "Let\u2019s be clear: It\u2019s not always a good idea to tell your boss that you\u2019re considering leaving your job, says Ravi Gajendran, chair of the global leadership and management department at Florida International University College of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s often a very risky move,\u201d he says. Yet, in some situations, this conversation can benefit both you and the organization. If you\u2019ve \u201ccarefully assessed your motivations and have a credible alternative\u201d \u2014 such as an outside job offer \u2014 it could present an opportunity to address underlying issues or explore new opportunities within the company. The key is to approach the conversation strategically, according to Melody Wilding, a career coach and the author of the forthcoming book, Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to find an intersection that\u2019s a triple win: a new role or responsibilities that are enjoyable and valuable for you, resonate with your boss, and align with your organization\u2019s goals.\u201d Here\u2019s how to get there.",
    "Even if you have a great relationship with your boss, Gajendran urges caution before discussing the possibility of leaving. Bosses have their own priorities and pressures, so their first instinct likely isn\u2019t to consider your needs. \u201cBringing up the prospect of quitting feels like an ultimatum,\u201d he says. Remember, too, that your boss is a steward of the organization, and by even hinting at your plans, \u201cyou\u2019ll be seen as someone with one foot out the door,\u201d says Wilding. \u00a0If you plan to leverage an outside offer, beware of the consequences, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a normalized strategy in some industries,\u201d but it can backfire. \u201cBe prepared for your boss to say, \u2018Go ahead and take that other offer.\u2019\u201d",
    "Understand your motivations\u2026",
    "Next, get clear on what you hope to get out of the conversation \u2014 especially if you want to stay at your organization. A promotion? A raise? Greater fulfillment? \u201cYou can address these issues without signaling your intention to leave,\u201d says Gajendran. (More on that later.) Taking the time to reflect will help you frame the discussion in a constructive way. If you\u2019re looking for advice or a sounding board, remember your boss might not be the best person for it. (More on that later, too.)",
    "\u2026And your boss\u2019s priorities",
    "A productive conversation about your future with the company also requires taking your boss\u2019s priorities into account. Gajendran advises thinking about how your boss works, what\u2019s important to them, and what\u2019s on their plate. Reflect, too, on \u201cwhat makes you indispensable to the organization.\u201d Are you the go-to person for certain projects? Do you have special relationships that benefit the company? Identifying these strengths will help you articulate your value more effectively. The goal is to find overlap between what you\u2019re looking for from your job and what will help your boss. The good news is that, \u201cIf your boss sees you as competent, capable, and trustworthy, they\u2019re more likely to be willing to do what\u2019s needed to retain you,\u201d Gajendran says.",
    "Don\u2019t mention the Q-word",
    "How you bring up your concerns is key, says Wilding. \u201cInstead of \u2018I\u2019m thinking about moving on,\u2019 try \u2018I love this company and care about the work. How can I continue adding value in the future?\u2019\u201d One strategy is to discuss the limitations of your role, allowing your boss to offer potential solutions or opportunities you may not have considered. Perhaps you\u2019re an individual contributor with no path for advancement or you\u2019ve hit the salary cap for your role. Your manager might recognize that you need to explore outside options and could help you network; or maybe they have information about an upcoming reorganization and openings in other teams. Sometimes an open-ended approach works best, she says.",
    "A key metric for managers is how well they cultivate talent, Wilding adds. This goes beyond just retaining employees; it also involves promoting them or helping them find a better fit elsewhere. Good managers understand that referring you to opportunities, whether inside or outside the organization, reflects positively on them, she says. \u201cCareers are long,\u201d and relationships matter.",
    "Another game plan is to be as specific as possible about what you need to be satisfied in your job and take what Wilding calls a \u201cpartnership approach\u201d to exploring options within the organization. This strategy keeps the conversation focused on your development rather than potential departure. \u201cSay to your boss, \u2018Here\u2019s my ideal situation. What can we do to get there?\u2019\u201d It might be new responsibilities, different working conditions, or professional development opportunities. Articulate how these changes would benefit both you and your organization, says Gajendran. \u201cSay: \u2018I could do these projects and take them off your plate and it would make me happier and more productive.\u2019\u201d Your message is simple, he says. \u201c\u2018I want to make it work here. How do we solve this puzzle together?\u2019\u201d",
    "Follow up professionally",
    "Your actions immediately after the conversation can reinforce positive developments or help smooth over a difficult interaction, says Gajendran. If the conversation went well, send a sincere note of gratitude that emphasizes collaboration. You might say: \u201cThank you for discussing my career goals. I appreciate your support and look forward to hearing about potential opportunities. If the conversation didn\u2019t go as planned, acknowledge any tension. Gajendran suggests something like, I realize our discussion may have caught you off guard. My goal was to seek guidance, and I apologize if I upset you.\u201d \u201cOnce the cat\u2019s out of the bag, all you can do is ask for time,\u201d Gajendran notes. \u201cLet the negative emotions dissipate.\u201d",
    "Look beyond your boss",
    "Thinking about quitting or exploring new opportunities is natural, especially if you feel you\u2019ve outgrown your current position. \u201cMaybe you want to do more execution, but you\u2019re stuck in admin,\u201d says Wilding. \u201cOr maybe you want to focus on a specific area, but you\u2019ve absorbed so many different jobs that you\u2019re doing a little of this and a little of that.\u201d This is why she stresses having advocates within your organization who aren\u2019t your direct boss, including your peers, your skip-level manager, and other senior leaders. Having candid conversations with these people about your career path can be eye-opening. \u201cPieces might start to fall into place,\u201d she says.",
    "And yet, Wilding warns against discussing a potential departure too freely. \u201cBe careful about telling others you\u2019re interviewing elsewhere,\u201d she warns. \u201cAs much as you might think conversations are airtight, the rumor mill is real and it could damage your relationship if your boss hears about it from other people.\u201d",
    "Principles to Remember",
    "Think about how you approach the conversation \u2014 bringing up quitting or leveraging outside offers can potentially backfire.",
    "Consider discussing the limitations of your role with your boss, as this can prompt them to offer networking assistance or information about upcoming openings in other teams.",
    "Adopt a partnership approach with your boss and focus on a solution that benefits both you and the organization, rather than potential departure.",
    "Overlook that your boss might want to help you find a better fit elsewhere \u2014 good managers not only retain talent but also seek to support people\u2019s growth.",
    "Say the Q-word; instead, frame the conversation around how you can continue adding value and growing within the company.",
    "Neglect to follow up appropriately after the conversion; your response can reinforce positive outcomes or help smooth over tensions.",
