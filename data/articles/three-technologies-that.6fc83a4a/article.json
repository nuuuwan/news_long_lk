    "Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which\u2014for better or worse\u2014stand to make waves in the coming years. They\u2019re the technologies you should really be paying attention to. This year\u2019s list includes tech that\u2019s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel\u2014and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby\u2019s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here\u2019s the story behind our biotech choices.  A base-edited baby! In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took\u00a0his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.",
    "KJ\u2019s\u00a0story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial\u2014a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ\u2019s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years. Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ\u2019s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics,\u00a0a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.",
    "US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have\u00a0described a potential approval pathway for such \u201cbespoke, personalized therapies.\u201d Watch this space. Gene resurrection It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to \u201cde-extinct\u201d animals like the\u00a0woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called\u00a0\u201cwoolly mice\u201d\u2014rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths. Related StoryGame of clones: Colossal\u2019s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?Read next The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time. Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves\u00a0is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We\u2019re talking about\u00a0the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.  Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in\u00a0attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more\u00a0here. Embryo scoring IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, \u201cscoring\u201d them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person\u2019s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial. Related StoryThe race to make the perfect baby is creating an ethical messRead nextRecently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ. This is\u00a0controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that\u00a0doesn\u2019t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don\u2019t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another. Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing,\u00a0you can\u2019t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to\u00a0have their \u201cbest baby.\u201d Read more\u00a0here.
