🔎 Once the skills are present, companies need to select appropriate projects for gen AI application.
🎯 This selection should involve backing the right innovators, choosing projects that give quick, practical gains and aligning projects with the company's identity.
💡 Gen AI is gaining popularity as it allows AI to perform knowledge work, previously a human's domain, creating content, boosting productivity.
