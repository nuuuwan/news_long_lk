    "Germany\u2019s economic growth challenges",
    "EconomyForecastingTradeEuropeGermanyCountry Analysis",
    "The German growth model has historically relied on globalisation and cheap energy inputs to fuel rising wages and living standards. Germany\u2019s economy is highly export oriented and strongly interlinked with the US and Chinese markets.",
    "However, structural challenges and geopolitical headwinds are threatening the viability of this growth model. Protectionism is on the rise, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has elevated energy costs.",
    "These issues will weaken Germany\u2019s growth outlook, but the country can counterbalance this by leveraging its skilled workforce and high-tech infrastructure with new green and digital investments.",
    "The German economy is strongly oriented around its manufacturing sector. German industry accounts for almost 30% of GDP, exceeding that of all the other major economies in western Europe, with the share in Italy about 24% and that in the UK and France about 18%. The workforce is highly skilled and educated, public debt is comparatively low, and the economy is underpinned by solid institutional fundamentals. However, the outlook is not rosy. German real GDP growth has been at the bottom of the G7 leaderboard ever since the pandemic, and\u00a0the country\u2019s growth model faces four fundamental challenges: trade reliance on the US and China, high energy prices, a lack of investment spending, and deteriorating demographic conditions.",
    "Challenge 1: Germany is heavily trade dependent on the US and China",
    "Germany stands out in Europe as the country that is by far the most reliant on trade and investment with China, putting it in stark contrast to other EU countries and the US. China is Germany\u2019s fourth-largest export destination but is also the country\u2019s largest import partner, and this presents challenges in the context of \u201cde-risking\u201d from China. Germany\u2019s goods trade balance with China has turned strongly negative in recent years, owing to the post-covid inflation in imported goods prices and a rebound in domestic demand. In addition, primary incomes from China, consisting of profits generated from German foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country, have been rising in recent years owing to German investments in the Chinese market.",
    "Despite German firms\u00a0pushing hard against trade barriers\u00a0with China,\u00a0the EU remains set on protecting its domestic industries,\u00a0announcing\u00a0tariffs of up to 50% on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs)\u00a0in early June. This includes a weighted average duty of 21% on Western brands producing EVs in China in partnership with Chinese joint ventures. These tariffs will wipe out the already slim margins for EVs built in China for export towards the EU.",
    "We expect\u00a0Donald Trump to win the US presidential election, and we expect the weighted average US tariff rate to increase to between 5% and 10%\u00a0(from 2% currently) by late 2025. Europe\u2019s steel and aluminium sectors are likely to see currently suspended tariffs of 25% and 10% reimposed.\u00a0Within Europe, Germany is the most exposed\u00a0to a second Trump presidency, owing to its large trade surplus with the US, which includes substantial luxury car exports.",
    "Challenge 2: high energy prices threaten productivity gains",
    "The competitiveness of German industries has been weakened by higher energy costs following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The lack of cheap Russian energy has raised input costs, weakening prospects for the manufacturing sector.\u00a0This will accelerate Germany\u2019s structural shift away from dependence on industrial activity towards its services industries\u2014namely the business services sector. This is problematic for headline growth, because productivity growth in services industries typically lags that of manufacturing. According to the Ifo Institute, a German think-tank, the contribution of the structural shift towards the services sector makes up 40% of the slowdown in growth in recent decades. We expect Germany to continue to\u00a0lag peer economies (particularly the US) in terms of productivity growth.",
    "Challenge 3: a public investment deficit with peer economies",
    "Investment rates in Germany have been among the lowest in western Europe for the past decade. Successive governments have been averse to public spending, placing consistent emphasis on running federal budget surpluses instead. According to the IMF, even money that is budgeted for investment is routinely underspent owing to staff shortages in municipal governments, while double the EU average of red tape in some areas (such as acquiring construction permits) puts off private-sector investors. The consequences include crumbling infrastructure, with notable strains in the railway network, and slow progress on introducing e-government services.\u00a0Germany\u2019s federal debt brake, which limits the annual structural federal budget deficit to 0.35% of GDP, was reinstated in 2024, reducing the scope for investment in the green transition, digital infrastructure and defence.",
    "Challenge 4: a poor demographic outlook",
    "Germany\u2019s working-age population is set to fall by an average of 0.6% per year in 2024\u201150, according to the UN, faster even than in Italy. The labour pool has been buoyed over the past decade by migrants, but we expect immigration flows to tighten in the coming years as mainstream parties adopt tougher policies. Along with the incipient wave of retirement among the baby boomer generation, this will significantly weaken the labour supply outlook.\u00a0Labour shortages will become a more pressing issue over the coming decades, which will increase the tax burden on the working population to fund ever-growing pension payments, while greater demand for healthcare draws workers from other, more productive industries.",
    "Offsetting effects: strengths and opportunities",
    "These challenges are substantial, but should not be overstated. Germany ranks in the top ten business locations in the world in our business environment ranking. Its strong institutional effectiveness and long-standing political stability support business investment and operations. Geographically, it is located at the heart of the EU, the second-largest consumer market in the world, after the US. The country also serves as headquarters for key industrial clusters centred around machinery manufacturing, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals and automobiles production.",
    "Germany is also well placed to lead the green transition in Europe.\u00a0A recent success story is Tesla\u2019s decision to build its European gigafactory in Berlin, the German capital, to take advantage of the high local skill level and pan-regional supply-chain links. The\u00a0latest FDI trends\u00a0suggest strong growth of green and digital projects in Germany. A record eight projects agreed in 2023 were over \u20ac1bn in size; the biggest was a\u00a0\u20ac10bn semiconductor plant in Dresden\u00a0by the chip giant TSMC (Taiwan), which benefited from state and EU subsidies. There is also a growing opportunity for Germany to develop its\u00a0start-up and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure\u00a0in order to better retain talent within the fledgling AI field.",
    "In the energy sector, up to \u20ac160bn in the German federal budget is earmarked for hydrogen infrastructure. Although as yet untested at scale,\u00a0this has the potential to future-proof Germany\u2019s energy-intensive industries,\u00a0such as steel and aluminium furnaces, which previously relied on cheap natural gas imports. Moreover, the EU\u2019s\u00a0Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\u00a0is scheduled to come into effect fully in 2026, which will make energy production within the EU more economically viable, particularly for renewable energy sources. It may also help bring to Germany\u2019s energy costs more into line with those of its competitors over the medium term.",
