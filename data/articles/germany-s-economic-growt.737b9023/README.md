Germany’s economic growth challenges

The German growth model has historically relied on globalisation and cheap energy inputs to fuel rising wages and living standards. Germany’s economy is highly export oriented and strongly interlinked with the US and Chinese markets.

However, structural challenges and geopolitical headwinds are threatening the viability of this growth model. Protectionism is on the rise, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated energy costs.

These issues will weaken Germany’s growth outlook, but the country can counterbalance this by leveraging its skilled workforce and high-tech infrastructure with new green and digital investments.

The German economy is strongly oriented around its manufacturing sector. German industry accounts for almost 30% of GDP, exceeding that of all the other major economies in western Europe, with the share in Italy about 24% and that in the UK and France about 18%. The workforce is highly skilled and educated, public debt is comparatively low, and the economy is underpinned by solid institutional fundamentals. However, the outlook is not rosy. German real GDP growth has been at the bottom of the G7 leaderboard ever since the pandemic, and the country’s growth model faces four fundamental challenges: trade reliance on the US and China, high energy prices, a lack of investment spending, and deteriorating demographic conditions.

Challenge 1: Germany is heavily trade dependent on the US and China

Germany stands out in Europe as the country that is by far the most reliant on trade and investment with China, putting it in stark contrast to other EU countries and the US. China is Germany’s fourth-largest export destination but is also the country’s largest import partner, and this presents challenges in the context of “de-risking” from China. Germany’s goods trade balance with China has turned strongly negative in recent years, owing to the post-covid inflation in imported goods prices and a rebound in domestic demand. In addition, primary incomes from China, consisting of profits generated from German foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country, have been rising in recent years owing to German investments in the Chinese market.

Despite German firms pushing hard against trade barriers with China, the EU remains set on protecting its domestic industries, announcing tariffs of up to 50% on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) in early June. This includes a weighted average duty of 21% on Western brands producing EVs in China in partnership with Chinese joint ventures. These tariffs will wipe out the already slim margins for EVs built in China for export towards the EU.

We expect Donald Trump to win the US presidential election, and we expect the weighted average US tariff rate to increase to between 5% and 10% (from 2% currently) by late 2025. Europe’s steel and aluminium sectors are likely to see currently suspended tariffs of 25% and 10% reimposed. Within Europe, Germany is the most exposed to a second Trump presidency, owing to its large trade surplus with the US, which includes substantial luxury car exports.

Challenge 2: high energy prices threaten productivity gains

The competitiveness of German industries has been weakened by higher energy costs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The lack of cheap Russian energy has raised input costs, weakening prospects for the manufacturing sector. This will accelerate Germany’s structural shift away from dependence on industrial activity towards its services industries—namely the business services sector. This is problematic for headline growth, because productivity growth in services industries typically lags that of manufacturing. According to the Ifo Institute, a German think-tank, the contribution of the structural shift towards the services sector makes up 40% of the slowdown in growth in recent decades. We expect Germany to continue to lag peer economies (particularly the US) in terms of productivity growth.

Challenge 3: a public investment deficit with peer economies

Investment rates in Germany have been among the lowest in western Europe for the past decade. Successive governments have been averse to public spending, placing consistent emphasis on running federal budget surpluses instead. According to the IMF, even money that is budgeted for investment is routinely underspent owing to staff shortages in municipal governments, while double the EU average of red tape in some areas (such as acquiring construction permits) puts off private-sector investors. The consequences include crumbling infrastructure, with notable strains in the railway network, and slow progress on introducing e-government services. Germany’s federal debt brake, which limits the annual structural federal budget deficit to 0.35% of GDP, was reinstated in 2024, reducing the scope for investment in the green transition, digital infrastructure and defence.

Challenge 4: a poor demographic outlook

Germany’s working-age population is set to fall by an average of 0.6% per year in 2024‑50, according to the UN, faster even than in Italy. The labour pool has been buoyed over the past decade by migrants, but we expect immigration flows to tighten in the coming years as mainstream parties adopt tougher policies. Along with the incipient wave of retirement among the baby boomer generation, this will significantly weaken the labour supply outlook. Labour shortages will become a more pressing issue over the coming decades, which will increase the tax burden on the working population to fund ever-growing pension payments, while greater demand for healthcare draws workers from other, more productive industries.

Offsetting effects: strengths and opportunities

These challenges are substantial, but should not be overstated. Germany ranks in the top ten business locations in the world in our business environment ranking. Its strong institutional effectiveness and long-standing political stability support business investment and operations. Geographically, it is located at the heart of the EU, the second-largest consumer market in the world, after the US. The country also serves as headquarters for key industrial clusters centred around machinery manufacturing, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals and automobiles production.

Germany is also well placed to lead the green transition in Europe. A recent success story is Tesla’s decision to build its European gigafactory in Berlin, the German capital, to take advantage of the high local skill level and pan-regional supply-chain links. The latest FDI trends suggest strong growth of green and digital projects in Germany. A record eight projects agreed in 2023 were over €1bn in size; the biggest was a €10bn semiconductor plant in Dresden by the chip giant TSMC (Taiwan), which benefited from state and EU subsidies. There is also a growing opportunity for Germany to develop its start-up and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in order to better retain talent within the fledgling AI field.

In the energy sector, up to €160bn in the German federal budget is earmarked for hydrogen infrastructure. Although as yet untested at scale, this has the potential to future-proof Germany’s energy-intensive industries, such as steel and aluminium furnaces, which previously relied on cheap natural gas imports. Moreover, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is scheduled to come into effect fully in 2026, which will make energy production within the EU more economically viable, particularly for renewable energy sources. It may also help bring to Germany’s energy costs more into line with those of its competitors over the medium term.
