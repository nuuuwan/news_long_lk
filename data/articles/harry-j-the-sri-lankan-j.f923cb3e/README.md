Harry Jayawardena was laid to rest on Independence Day in Ja-Ela, marking the end of an era. More than just a businessman, Harry J was a force of nature. Much like Jack Welch, the legendary CEO of General Electric, he possessed an unmatched ability to execute strategies, transform industries, and make bold decisions with unwavering confidence. His leadership style was a blend of pragmatism, resilience, and an innate ability to anticipate economic and business trends well ahead of his peers.

I got to know Harry J in 1990. He was a childhood friend of my father-in-law, former Minister John Amaratunga. Their friendship dated back to the 1950s. This made it easy for me to connect with him on several fronts. Knowing him was both a privilege and a singular honour, and I will never forget the guidance and support he gave me as Chairman of HNB and Commercial Bank, and later in the public sector.

His defining quality was his unwavering commitment to his word. In an era where business deals often faltered due to changing circumstances, Harry J stood out as a man who honoured his commitments, no matter the risks. This earned him immense respect among his peers and business partners. Political leaders sought his counsel, as his uncanny vision allowed him to see beyond the next bend on the road.

He had a unique ability to guide and influence some of Sri Lanka’s heads of state, ensuring that economic decisions were pragmatic and beneficial to the country. His execution skills were second to none. While many leaders focused on strategy, Harry J had the rare ability to turn plans into action and action into success. His businesses thrived because he paid attention to detail while keeping the bigger picture in mind.

Whether in beverages, hospitality, or finance, he had a sharp eye for opportunities and an unyielding drive to see them through. Like Jack Welch, he believed in efficiency, productivity, and delivering results, often making tough decisions to keep his businesses competitive and ahead of the curve.

Beyond his business acumen, Harry J never forgot a good deed. Loyalty, friendship, and integrity were central to his character, and those who worked with him knew they could count on his support when they had proven their worth. He valued relationships, built long-term partnerships, and mentored countless individuals who would go on to shape Sri Lanka’s business and even political landscape.

Harry J was a titan of Sri Lankan business, a hard-nosed executor who ensured that plans didn’t just remain ideas on paper. It may be some time before Sri Lanka sees another all-round business leader like him. His passing marks the end of an era, but his legacy remains in the institutions he built, the industries he transformed, and the countless lives he influenced. Like Jack Welch, he was a visionary who led with courage, decisiveness, and an unshakable belief in getting things done.

Goodbye, Harry J. We will certainly miss you, but your legacy will endure guiding countless future generations of aspiring leaders.

Your famous words capture the essence of the giant you were:

“It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness, so get on with it”.

May the turf lie gently on you forever.
