    "Be honest: Have you ever looked up someone from your childhood on social media with the sole intention of seeing how they\u2019ve aged?\u00a0 One of my colleagues, who shall remain nameless, certainly has. He recently shared a photo of a former classmate. \u201cCan you believe we\u2019re the same age?\u201d he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. A relative also delights in this pastime. \u201cWow, she looks like an old woman,\u201d she\u2019ll say when looking at a picture of someone she has known since childhood. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others.  But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well\u2014or poorly\u2014someone\u2019s body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered \u201cbiologically older\u201d than a similar-age person who doesn\u2019t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.\u00a0 Related StoryThe quest to legitimize longevity medicineLongevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there\u2019s a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.",
    "Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients\u2019 strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply \u201ceyeball\u201d them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic.",
    "But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they\u2019ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself.\u00a0 \u201cAging clocks\u201d are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. They hint at our biological age. While chronological age is simply how many birthdays we\u2019ve had, biological age is meant to reflect something deeper. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and\u2014perhaps\u2014lets us know how much more of it we have left. And while you can\u2019t change your chronological age, you just might be able to influence your biological age.",
    "It\u2019s not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. \u201cMy telomeres say I\u2019m 10 years old,\u201d Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khlo\u00e9 was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven \u201canti-aging\u201d supplements. The science is still new, and few experts in the field\u2014some of whom affectionately refer to it as \u201cclock world\u201d\u2014would argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual\u2019s biological age.\u00a0 But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch\u2014or even just an eye-catching number. In fact, they are helping scientists unravel some of the deepest mysteries in biology: Why do we age? How do we age? When does aging begin? What does it even mean to age? Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process.  Clocks kick off The way your genes work can change. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. These epigenetic markers, as they are known, can switch genes on or off, or increase or decrease how much protein they make. They\u2019re not part of our DNA, but they influence how it works. In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. Steve is straight; he says his twin brother, Markus, who also volunteered, is gay. That study didn\u2019t find a link between DNA methyl\u00adation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend\u2014a very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. He once told me he fell off his chair when he saw it.\u00a0 Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn\u2019t clear how methylation might be related to those diseases.",
    "If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.  In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock\u2014essentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. From a tissue sample, it was able to detect a person\u2019s age within a range of 2.9 years. That clock changed everything. Its publication in 2013 marked the birth of \u201cclock world.\u201d To some, the possibilities were almost endless. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all. The epigenetic clock was a success story in \u201ca field that, frankly, doesn\u2019t have a lot of success stories,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Pedro de Magalh\u00e3es, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK. It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Horvath became a bit of a celebrity. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper. Related StoryAging hits us in our 40s and 60s. But well-being doesn\u2019t have to fall off a cliff.Lifestyle changes could counter some of the deterioration.",
    "Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl\u00adation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins. Today, there are hundreds or even thousands of clocks out there, says Chiara Herzog, who researches aging at King\u2019s College London and is a member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium. Everyone has a favorite. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death. That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won\u2019t use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn\u2019t be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that hints at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end. GrimAge is not perfect. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). \u201cPeople are complicated,\u201d Horvath tells MIT Technology Review. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge error bar.\u201d",
    "On the whole, the clocks are pretty good at making predictions about health and lifespan. They\u2019ve been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age. Black-box clocks But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. The best clocks will deliver an estimate that reflects how far a person\u2019s biology deviates from the average. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person\u2019s chronological age, but you don\u2019t want them to be too close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years.",
    "None of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person. Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.LEON EDLER   \u201cThere\u2019s this paradox,\u201d says Camillo. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that\u2019s all it will tell you\u2014and it probably won\u2019t reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they\u2019ve had. Camillo says he\u2019s noticed that when the clocks get too close to \u201cperfect\u201d age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality. Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? It is a difficult question for a field whose members notoriously fail to agree on the basics. (Everything from the definition of aging to how it occurs and why is up for debate among the experts.)  They do agree that aging is incredibly complex. A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it\u2019s only giving you an idea of their \u201cepigenetic age,\u201d says Chandra. There are probably plenty of other biological markers that might reveal other aspects of aging, he says: \u201cNone of the clocks measure everything.\u201d\u00a0 We don\u2019t know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Are these changes causing damage? Or are they a by-product of it? Are the epigenetic patterns seen in a 90-year-old a sign of deterioration? Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age? To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on. \u201cThe biomarkers have this black-box quality,\u201d says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cSome of them are probably causal, some of them may be adaptive \u2026 and some of them may just be neutral\u201d: either \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for them not to happen\u201d or \u201cthey just happen by random chance.\u201d",
    "What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khlo\u00e9). Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results. Even the same clock can give you different answers if you put a sample through it more than once. \u201cThey\u2019re not yet individually predictive,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they\u2019re more or less likely to develop disease.\u201d And it\u2019s why plenty of aging researchers\u2014even those who regularly use the clocks in their work\u2014haven\u2019t bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. \u201cLet\u2019s say I do a clock and it says that my biological age \u2026 is five years older than it should be,\u201d says Magalh\u00e3es. \u201cSo what?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t see much point in it.\u201d You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. But plenty of clinics are offering them anyway. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. Others will simply offer an estimate of biological age as part of a longevity treatment package.",
    "And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn\u2019t stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of \u201ctreatments\u201d that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections. Some of these people come to aging meetings. I was in the audience at an event when one CEO took to the stage to claim he had reversed his own biological age by 18 years\u2014thanks to the supplement he was selling. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached \u201clongevity escape velocity.\u201d Related StoryWhy the term \u201cwomen of childbearing age\u201d is problematicNew movie The Substance showcases how women are thought about in terms of youth and fertility. That idea makes for bad research and health guidance.",
    "But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn\u2019t yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he\u2019d \u201chave to increase the price of our product more than four times\u201d to pay for one. (The company has so far tested the active ingredient in mice and carried out a provisional trial in people.) More generally, Horvath says he \u201cgets a bad taste in [his] mouth\u201d when people use the clocks to sell products and \u201cmake a quick buck.\u201d But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. \u201cPeople truly believe their own nonsense,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are so passionate about what they discovered, they fall into this trap of believing [their] own prejudices.\u201d\u00a0 The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalh\u00e3es. \u201cThe field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes with the territory.\u201d (Weldon, for his part, says Rejuvant is the only product that has \u201cclinically meaningful\u201d claims.)\u00a0 In any case, Magalh\u00e3es adds that he thinks any publicity is better than no publicity. And there\u2019s the rub. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. They\u2019ll agree that the clocks aren\u2019t ready for consumer prime time, but they tend to appreciate the attention. Longevity research is expensive, after all. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow.\u00a0 So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn\u2019t end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their \u201cbiological ages\u201d to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging.  How to be young again Two little mice lie side by side, anesthetized and unconscious, as Jim White prepares his scalpel. The animals are of the same breed but look decidedly different. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. By comparison, the second mouse, a 20-month-old, looks a little the worse for wear. Its fur is graying and patchy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail. But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. White, with some help from a colleague, makes incisions along the side of each mouse\u2019s body and into the upper part of an arm and leg on the same side. He then carefully stitches the two animals together\u2014membranes, fascia, and skin.\u00a0 The procedure takes around an hour, and the mice are then roused from their anesthesia. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. But within a few days, they seem to have accepted that they now share their bodies. Soon their circulatory systems will fuse, and the animals will share a blood flow too.  \u201cPeople are complicated. There\u2019s a huge error bar.\u201d \u2014 Steve Horvath, former biostatistician at the University of California, Los AngelesLEON EDLER   White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. And he\u2019s seen a curious phenomenon occur. The older mice appear to benefit from the arrangement. They seem to get younger. Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months\u2014equivalent to around 10 human years. The team then carefully separated the animals to assess how each of them had fared. \u201cYou\u2019d think that they\u2019d want to separate immediately,\u201d says White. \u201cBut when you detach them \u2026 they kind of follow each other around.\u201d The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. \u201c[They lived] around 10% longer, but [they] also maintained a lot of [their] function,\u201d says White. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds. When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. \u201cThe young circulation slowed aging in the old mice,\u201d says White. The effect seemed to last, too\u2014at least for a little while. \u201cIt preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,\u201d he says. The young mice went the other way and appeared biologically older, both while they were attached to the old mice and shortly after they were detached. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: \u201cThe young mice went back to being young again.\u201d\u00a0  To White, this suggests that something about the \u201cyouthful state\u201d might be programmed in some way. That perhaps it is written into our DNA. Maybe we don\u2019t have to go through the biological process of aging.\u00a0 This gets at a central debate in the aging field: What is aging, and why does it happen? Some believe it\u2019s simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above. White\u2019s theory is that being old is just \u201ca loss of youth,\u201d he says. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way.\u00a0 Dogs and dolphins Horvath\u2019s eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. It seems to represent aging in all these tissues, which is why Horvath calls it a pan-tissue clock. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them. But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a pan-species model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. He tried zoos, too.\u00a0 \u00a0  The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging\u2014not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.  \u201cI learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had freezers full of [them].\u201d Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath\u2019s lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model. Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. But he ended up receiving around 15,000 samples from 200 scientists, representing 348 species\u2014including everything from dogs to dolphins. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them? \u201cI truly felt it would fail,\u201d says Horvath. \u201cBut it turned out that I was completely wrong.\u201d He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The result, which was published in 2023 as the pan-mammalian clock, can estimate the age of any mammal and even the maximum lifespan of the species. The data set is open to anyone who wants to download it, he adds: \u201cI hope people will mine the data to find the secret of how to extend a healthy lifespan.\u201d  The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging\u2014not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it. Comparisons between mammals also support the idea that the slower methylation changes occur, the longer the lifespan of the animal, says Nelly Olova, an epigeneticist who researches aging at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \u201cDNA methylation slowly erodes with age,\u201d she says. \u201cWe still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.\u201d The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning. \u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the instructions become too messy and noisy \u2026 it cannot support life.\u201d Olova has been investigating exactly when aging clocks first begin to tick\u2014in other words, the point at which aging starts. Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. The trained clocks are then typically used to estimate the biological age of adults. But they can also be used on samples from children. Or babies. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos.\u00a0 In her research, Olova used adult skin cells, which\u2014thanks to Nobel Prize\u2013winning research in the 2000s\u2014can be \u201creprogrammed\u201d back to a state resembling that of the pluripotent stem cells found in embryos. When Olova and her colleagues used a \u201cpartial reprogramming\u201d approach to take cells close to that state, they found that the closer they got to the entirely reprogrammed state, the \u201cyounger\u201d the cells were.\u00a0 Related StoryMaybe you will be able to live past 122Scientific advances, public interest, and an unprecedented level of investment are pushing the longevity industry to help us live longer in better health.",
    "It was around 20 days after the cells had been reprogrammed into stem cells that they reached the biological age of zero according to the clock used, says Olova. \u201cIt was a bit surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cThe pluripotent cells measure as minus 0.5; they\u2019re slightly below zero.\u201d Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. After all, some kind of rejuvenation happens during the early stages of embryo formation\u2014an aged egg cell and an aged sperm cell somehow create a brand-new cell. The slate is wiped clean. Gladyshev calls this point \u201cground zero.\u201d He posits that it\u2019s reached sometime during the \u201cmid-embryonic state.\u201d At this point, aging begins. And so does \u201corganismal life,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,\u201d says Olova.\u00a0  Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. \u201cBefore that, it\u2019s just a bunch of cells.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins\u2014perhaps as the result of \u201ca generational clearance of damage,\u201d says Poganik. It is early days\u2014no pun intended\u2014for this research, and the science is far from settled. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. There might be a way to slow aging once cells reach a certain biological age, too.\u00a0 \u201cPresumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before \u2026 you\u2019re full of gray hair,\u201d says Poganik. \u201cIt could mean that there is an ideal window for intervention which is much earlier than our current geriatrics-based approach.\u201d When young meets old When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. \u201cI was like, look at them go! They\u2019re together, and they don\u2019t even care!\u201d he says. Since then, he\u2019s learned a few tricks. He tends to work with female mice, for instance\u2014the males tend to bicker and nip at each other, he says. The females, on the other hand, seem to get on well.\u00a0 The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect. Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there\u2019s a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery.\u00a0 But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people.\u00a0  If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it.  Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. \u201cAfter a few months, the tissue may assimilate the biological age of the organism,\u201d he says.\u00a0 If that\u2019s the case, the benefits of young organs might be short-lived. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation\u2014for example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Reprogramming these cells to a youthful state, perhaps one a little closer to \u201cground zero,\u201d might be the way to go. Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people. \u201cWe have the machinery to reset our epigenetic clock to a more youthful state,\u201d says White. \u201cThat means we have the ability to turn the clock backwards.\u201d\u00a0 hide"
