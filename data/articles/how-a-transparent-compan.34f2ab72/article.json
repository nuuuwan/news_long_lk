  "body_paragraphs": [
    "Data is your organization\u2019s most valuable resource\u2014and its most vulnerable.",
    "The foundation of your business strategy, decision making, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the most attractive target of escalating and increasingly complex malware and ransomware attacks that can disrupt business resilience by immobilizing production, operations, supply chains, and service delivery.",
    "Your cybersecurity infrastructure is only as strong as its weakest points. And attackers have learned to exploit opportunities that aren\u2019t technological but cultural.",
    "As much as your business can use AI to strengthen your efficiency and productivity, criminals can also use it to write sophisticated code at an unprecedented speed and volume. And unfortunately, AI\u2019s technological evolution is outpacing humans\u2019 social engineering. Staffers who know how to spot email phishing attacks might be less prepared to resist deepfakes that realistically impersonate familiar voices and faces.",
    "Beyond any criminal intent, the proliferation of remote work has increased risk exposure by enabling unintentional negligence, such as misplacing a company mobile device, forgetting to swipe a badge, or working with proprietary data over public Wi-Fi instead of using a virtual private network.",
    "Breaches and attacks are increasingly inevitable not just for large global companies but for small and medium-sized enterprises as well.",
    "But for that technology to offer its full protective potential, companies must build and maintain a strong cybersecurity culture across all teams, says Dave Russell, SVP Product Strategy at Veeam.",
    "\u201cIf you just push out a mandate with security rules but you don\u2019t convey why the rules exist,\u201d Russell says, \u201cthat may look to some employees like yet another obstacle to circumvent rather than a layer of protection to help you meet your revenue goals.\u201d",
    "Overcoming a Culture of Silence",
    "Operational downtime, customer frustration, and public relations headaches are just some of the lasting impacts of a cyber disaster. Given the high stakes of a breach, it\u2019s no surprise that some organizations may inadvertently be making their employees nervous about reporting cybersecurity issues\u2014especially employees who fall for carefully laid social engineering traps.",
    "However uncomfortable it may feel in the moment to raise the alarm, an organization\u2019s \u201cculture of silence\u201d on cybersecurity issues can be far more costly, delaying incident response and recovery in such areas as automation, recovery testing, and cross-functional planning\u2014and potentially eroding morale and testing partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 trust.",
    "\u201cNobody wants to inflict reputational damage, and that\u2019s where that culture of silence comes from,\u201d says Vamshi Kommineni, Group Product Manager at Azure Storage, Microsoft. \u201cBut you can have a positive impact on the outcome if you have a report-early-and-often culture.\u201d",
    "Overcoming a culture of silence requires both sophisticated tools and intentional leadership. Even the most innovative data-resilience technology and thoughtful cybersecurity strategy still need openness, transparency, and accountability to work.",
    "That resulting culture of resilience must extend from IT to the whole organization, in both articulating cybersecurity rationale and encouraging employees to speak up with no-blame or anonymous reporting policies\u2014or, in an even more proactive environment, positive reinforcement that rewards discovery.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s have transparency,\u201d Russell says. \u201cLet\u2019s not penalize anyone. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re not underreporting incidents or glossing over them, and enable a culture where it\u2019s OK to say it\u2019s an issue and take the opportunity to say, \u2018What could we be doing better?\u2019\u201d",
    "The Resilience Framework",
    "Finance and health care companies are entrusted with protecting their customers\u2019 most sensitive data. These industries face constant pressure to advance their cybersecurity and strengthen overall data resilience.",
    "In an increasingly networked and connected world, their best practices now apply universally. \u201cEverything we deploy has a multiplicative effect,\u201d Kommineni says. \u201cThat gives us a strong sense of responsibility to our customers.\u201d",
    "Regardless of its size or sector, your organization can support its employees, partners, and customers by fostering a culture of transparency and pairing it with a research-backed comprehensive resilience framework.",
    "A sophisticated data resilience maturity model (DRMM) can measure maturity across strategy, people, process, and six core technology domains\u2014backup, recovery, architecture and portability, security, reporting, and intelligence\u2014to expose the technical and cultural gaps that impede recovery.",
    "Beyond its tools\u2019 technical capabilities, a cybersecurity provider\u2019s most significant value comes through partnership, helping businesses build improvement roadmaps and cultural best practices to replace a culture of silence with a culture of resilience.",
    "High-maturity organizations recover from outages two to three times faster than low-maturity counterparts do. One health care network cut $5 million per outage after maturing resilience practices. A global bank used integrated recovery strategies to eliminate cyber-related outages altogether.",
    "Disruption is inevitable. And resilient cultures, with all teams and practices aligned, use disruption to get stronger. \u201cWe all have a role to play in cybersecurity,\u201d Russell says. \u201cTechnology matters. But what matters more is being aligned on intent.\u201d",
    "Resilience starts with culture. The Veeam Data Resilience Maturity Model shows where you stand\u2014in technology, transparency, and trust. Measure your maturity, close the gaps, and lead your organization beyond silence toward strength. Learn more about Veeam\u2019s DRMM today."
