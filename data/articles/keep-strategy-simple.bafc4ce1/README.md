Few companies have a clear idea of where strategy making ends and execution begins. As a result they develop strategic plans where they’re not required and fail to develop strategic plans where they are. To help prevent this happening to your Graham Kenny offers a few dos and don’ts: (1) Don’t develop strategic plans for functions; (2) Confine “strategy” to the business level; (3) Keep strategy and action separate; and (4) Be careful how you use the terms “strategy” and “strategic.”

In one of my recent LinkedIn discussions about business strategy, a commenter lamented: “Unfortunately, many of the strategic plans we see are no more than a mish-mash collage of ‘individual level’ rush-to-do’s, often missing out on an ‘organization-level’ cohesive and thought-through design intent.”
