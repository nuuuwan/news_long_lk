    "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year. This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year\u2019s worst tech list.  We like to think there\u2019s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.  That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.",
    "On reflection, Musk said he wouldn\u2019t do it again. \u201cInstead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically \u2026 worked on my companies,\u201d he told an interviewer this month. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t have been burning the cars.\u201d Regrets\u20142025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.",
    "NEO, the home robot  1X TECH   Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It\u2019s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it\u2019s going to remain there\u2014at least for a while. That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will \u201chandle any of your chores reliably\u201d when it ships next year. But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn\u2019t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.  Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

Sycophantic AI  It\u2019s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade\u2014ChatGPT\u2014often behaves exactly that way.",
    "This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive.\u00a0This electronic yes-man routine isn\u2019t an accident; it\u2019s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.  But it\u2019s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users\u2019 delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide. In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of \u201cvalidating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.\u201d Don\u2019t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: \u201cI love this concept.\u201d  More: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)  The company that cried \u201cdire wolf\u201d  COLOSSAL BIOSCIENCES   When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white. That\u2019s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.",
    "To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They\u2019d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they \u201care not dire wolves,\u201d according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Colossal\u2019s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as \u201ca ready-to-use conservation solution,\u201d said the IUCN, \u201crisks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.\u201d",
    "In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. \u201cThey\u2019re dire wolves, end of story,\u201d it says.\u00a0\u00a0 More: Game of Clones: Colossal\u2019s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines\u2014and the new technology delivered in record time.\u00a0 But now that America\u2019s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., \u201cmRNA\u201d has become\u00a0a political slur.",

And shot maker Moderna\u2014once America\u2019s champion\u2014has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak. The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn\u2019t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

    "\u200b\u200bGreenlandic Wikipedia  WIKIPEDIA   Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there\u2019s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more. Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia.\u00a0As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense. Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic \u201cdoom spiral\u201d for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\u00a0\u00a0 In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible \u201charm to the Greenlandic language.\u201d Read more: \u00a0Can AI Help Revitalize Indigenous Languages?

That\u2019s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.  So maybe it would end up a hit. Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year\u2019s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\u00a0 With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise\u2014collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they\u2019ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin\u2019s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses. The White House says there\u2019s nothing amiss. \u201cThe American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,\u201d said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)  \u201cCarbon-neutral\u201d Apple Watch  APPLE   In 2023, Apple announced its \u201cfirst-ever carbon-neutral product,\u201d a watch with \u201czero\u201d net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees. Critics say it\u2019s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can\u2019t advertise products as carbon neutral because the \u201csupposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations\u201d isn\u2019t a sure thing. Apple\u2019s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn\u2019t say \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only \u201cdiscourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.\u201d  More: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple\u2019s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple) hide"
