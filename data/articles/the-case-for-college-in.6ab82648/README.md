Does pursuing a college education still make sense in the age of online learning and AI — when we have access to information for free via the internet? The problem with this question is that it frames college as an information gatekeeper, misunderstanding much of its value. For many, higher education institutions offer more than that: a transformative journey where students can network and develop transferable soft skills that require teamwork and repetition. You can maximize your college experience by leaning into these opportunities while simultaneously staying up to date with the latest technological trends. By being agile, networking vigorously, cultivating problem-solving skills, and seeking learning opportunities in the real world while in school, you can prepare yourself for a successful career.

Today, we have access to more information than ever before. YouTube and TikTok can provide us with in-depth learning opportunities for free — from professional development tips to AI tutorials. In more recent years, large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini have shown they can answer almost any question that comes to mind with an increasing level of accuracy.
