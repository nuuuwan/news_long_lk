Tamil cinema fans like this writer who grew up on a diet of Tamil movies  were deeply saddened when veteran South Indian actress B. Saroja Devi passed away  some days ago on 14 July 2025.  The octogenarian  Saroja Devi  after performing her daily  30 minute pooja in the mornings  was seated on a sofa watching TV  when she collapsed suddenly with a groan.The unconscious Saroja Devi was taken by ambulance to hospital where she was pronounced dead upon arrival. She was 87 years old.

Among actresses in Tamil movies , Saroja Devi has been a favourite of mine since boyhood. In a screen career spanning more than five decades, Saroja Devi has acted in 209 films. Of these she played the heroine or leading lady in 161 films.  She  was cast in supportive actress roles  or character actor roles in the other movies. In the early stages of her career, Saroja  made brief appearances as a dancer too.

In those days the success of a film was judged by the number of weeks it was screened uninterruptedly in a  cinema theatre.  Out of the 161 films in which Saroja Devi acted as the heroine, 103 ran for more than a hundred days .Some  celebrated silver jubilees running for more than 25 weeks at a stretch. A few were Golden jubilee hits running for more than 50 weeks.

Sivaji Ganesan, M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) and Gemini Ganesan comprised the triumvirate that dominated Tamil movies from the fifties to the seventies of the 20th century.The top thespian trinity of that vintage in Tamil cinema were Sivaji, MGR and Gemini. They ruled the roost in ‘Kollywood’ as the Tamil Nadu film industry is referred to in lighter vein.

Tamil Cinema “Moovaenthar”

The triple dynasties in Tamil history are the Cheras, Chozhas and Pandyas. They were known as the “Moovaenthar” or three Kings. Sivaji, MGR and Gemini were often referred to as the  Moovaenthar of Tamil cinema. Several actresses like Bhanumathy, Anjali Devi, Padmini, Savithri , Devika, Jamuna Sowcar Janaki,  K.R.Vijaya, Jayalalithaa and  Vaanishree  have acted opposite them as their leading ladies.

However it is  only Saroja Devi who  has  paired with  the trio in near equal number of films.She has acted in 26 films with MGR, 22 with Sivaji and 17 with Gemini.  Furthermore she has also acted in many films with  SS Rajendran a contemporary of MGR,Sivaji and Gemini.In that context ,  it could be  said that Saroja Devi  reigned as the uncrowned queen of Tamil cinema in the early and mid-sixties of the last century .

Saroja Devi  was hugely popular with Sri Lankan movie audiences too. Apart from Tamil and  Muslim Film fans, the actress had many Sinhala fans too especially women. This became  widely known when Saroja Devi accompanied MG Ramachandran (MGR) on a tour of the Island in 1965. Both were mobbed by fans wherever they went. It was obvious that the chief magnet attracting the fans was MGR. However Saroja Devi herself drew crowds in her own right. When Tamil newspapers interviewed these fans,it was found that many were Sinhalese fans rooting for Saroja Devi.

Saroja Devi was  born on 7 January 1938 in Bengaluru known then as Bangalore  when India was under British rule. Though resident in Bangalore/Bengaluru in British India, the family  was originally from Dhashavara in th Channapatna division of the erstwhile kingdom of the Maharajah of Mysore.

Her  father Bhairappa was a Police officer while her mother Rudrammaah was a homemaker.  Saroja Devi was the fourth of five daughters. Her given name was Radha Devi. It was changed to Saroja Devi when she began acting in films. Her  three elder sisters were named Saraswathy Devi.  Bhama Devi and  Sita Devi while her younger sister was Vasantha Devi..

Born in  Bangalore, Saroja Devi  regarded hereself as a   Bengaluru vaasi.  She lived  in the Malleswaram area of Bengaluru since childhood. Since the actress goes by the name of B.Saroja Devi,many assume the  initial denotes her father Bhairappa.  Saroja Devi however  has on many occasions said the initial “B” stands for  Bangalore or Bengaluru.

Sarojadevi had her primary and secondary education at St. Teresa’  Girls’ High School in Chamraipet,Bangalore. Her ambition was to be either a medical doctor or school teacher but fate decreed otherwise. Saroja was a good singer and dancer who participated in school concerts. While performing in a concert, Saroja Devi  caught the eye of singer,actor and film producer Honnappa Bhagavathar . Saroja Devi’s parents were  contacted  and told that Bhagavathar wanted their daughter to act in a film  with him..

Bairappa and Rudramma were amenable. Sarojadevi acted opposite Honnappa Bhagavathar  in the  Kannada film “Mahakavi Kalidasa” that was released in 1955. The film directed by K.R. Seetharama Saastry was about the legendary poet Kalidasa played by Honnappa Bhagavathar. Saroja Devi acted as  Vudyadhare. She was 17 years  old at that time. The film won a  national award.

After her breakthrough “Mahakavi Kalidasa” film, Saroja Devi got more offers to act in Kannada films. This was followed by chances to act in minor roles  in Tamil movies such as “Illaramae  Nallaram” , “Thangamalai Rahasiyam” and  “Parthiban Kanavu” .

The budding actress got her big break in Tamil films when MGR cast her opposite him in  the film “Naadodi Mannan” (Vagabond King) a Tamilised version of the  1952 English film “Prisoner of Zenda” starring Stewart Granger. Nadodi Mannan  was directed and produced by MGR himself who also  acted in a dual role  in the film. In one he played the vagabond Veeraangan and in the other MGR was the King Maarthaandan. The actress MN Rajam acting as Manohari  paired with the King Maarthaandan while   senior actress Bhanumathi  and “fresher” Saroja Devi  were the love interests of vagabond Veerangan in the movie.

The first half of the 220 minute long  movie was shot  in black and white. The second half was filmed in Geva colour.  According to the  film’s story , sequences in the first half happen in the country known as  Ratnapuri while the scenes in the second half take place in the Island  named Kannitheevu.. Bhanumathi acting as Madhana dies at the end of the first half. Saroja Devi  playing Ratna makes her entrance   in the second half.

Since Saroja Devi was not very fluent in Tamil her dialogues were simplified so that she could pronounce them easily. A  dance  set to the song “Maanaith Thaedi” was picturized on her. There was also a duet “Kannil Vanthu Minnal” with MGR. The  singer Jikki voiced for Saroja Devi in both songs .

The movie was a block-buster. While increasing the stature of MGR,  the commercial success of Nadodi Mannan ,led to a flood of film offers for Saroja Devi. It is said that she signed 35 contracts in 30 days then.

It is widely believed that Nadodi Mannan was the first Tamil film in which Saroja Devi  acted in a lead role .That however is incorrect. The first Tamil film in which Saroja Devi acted as heroine was “Senkottai Singham”( Red Fort Lion) produced by Chinnappa Devar of Devar films fame. “Senkottai Singham” starring  actor Udaykumar and Saroja Devi was released on 11 July 1958. Nadodi Mannan starring MGR was released six weeks later on 22 August 1958.

In later years after MG Ramachandran’s demise, Saroja Devi would acknowledge the pivotal role MGR played in her life by giving her a lead role in his film .She would refer to him as her “Kankanda Deivam”(Visible  God). After Nadodi Mannan , Saroja Devi acted opposite MGR in the film “Thirudathe” released in  March 1961. This was followed by another film with MGR “Thaai Sollai Thattathey”in November 1961 .

Thereafter a number of films  starring  MGR and Saroja Devi were released over the years. Almost all of them clicked at the box -office. Among the more successful films with MGR are Enga Veetu Pillai, Padagotti, Anbae Vaa, Peria Idathu Penn, Panakkaara Kudumbam , Kalangarai Vilakkam and Panathottam.  The last film they acted together was “Arasakattalai” in 1967.

In earlier films,MGR adopted a “ hands -off” policy towards his heroines . He would never touch his heroines  on screen even during love scenes.. Saroja Devi changed all that. It was with her that MGR began touching his heroines on screen. The  on screen chemistry between MGR and Saroja Devi was enchanting. Beginning with Saroja Devi,MGR began acting closely with his other heroines like Jayalalithaa, Manjula and Latha.

Saroja Devi’s first film opposite Sivaji Ganesan as heroine was “Bhaga Pirivinai” released on 31 October 1959. She had acted with Sivaji before in the film “Sabash Meena” but  not in a lead role. In fact she was paired with the  ace comedian Chandrababu. Saroja Devi also acted in a minor role with Sivaji in Thangamalai Rahasiyam. Bhagapirivinai directed by the legendary Bhimsingh was a box office success. Saroja Devi acting as Sivaji’s lover and wife Ponni in the film had a duet “Thaalaiyaam Poo mudichu”and a solo”Thangathiley” in the  film.

This was followed by many more Sivaji-Saroja Devi films. Some of the notable ones were Paalum Pazhamum, Vidi velli ,Iruvar Ullam, Paarthaal Pasi theerum, Aalaya Mani, Pudhiya Paravai and Thaenum Paalum.  The last film they acted together in was “Once more”released in 1997.

The third of the Moovaenthar, Gemini Ganesan  acted first with Saroja Devi as heroine  in “Kalyana Parisu” directed by maestro CV Sridhar. Earlier  She had  played minor roles in films with Gemini such as Thirumanam.  Kalyana Parisu  film released on 9 April  1959 was a path breaking success.It established Saroja Devi as a good actress This was followed by another film “Vaazha Vaitha Deivam” with Gemini released on 28 August 1959.

These  were  followed by more films opposite Gemini. Among these were Kairaasi, Aadi Perukku, Vaazhkai  Vaazhvathatkae, Elloarum Innaattu Mannar,  Pani Thirai, Panamaa Paasamaa, Thamarai Nenjam, Kula Vilakku and Ainthu Lathcham. The last film in which Gemini and Saroja Devi acted together was “Ponmanachelvan”released in 1989.

Vasanthi, Shanthi and Meena.

Of all the  Tamil  films Saroja Devi  acted in as heroine ,there are three outstanding memorable roles enacted by her. The first is as Vasanthi in Kalyanap Parisu. The second is as Shanthi in Paalum Pazhamum. The third is as Meena in “Aalayamani”. It was  recorded  in a newspaper article  that many in India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia in those days  named their  newly born daughters Vasanthi, Shanthi and Meena after the characters played by Saroja Devi.

Though Saroja Devi hailed  from Karnataka,  the most number of films she has acted in a single language  are in  Tamil. Kannada films come a close second.Telugu and Hindi are third and fourth. At one stage, she  was acting in so many Tamil films that she worked in three shifts. The first  shift from 7 am to 1 PM .The second  shift from 2 PM to 6 PM. The third  shift from 9 PM to  1 AM.  Her hundredth   film was in Tamil named “Penn Endraal Penn”.  The last film she acted in Tamil was “Aadhavan” released in 2009 . She played actor Surya’s grandmother in the movie.

No Films In Malayalam

Saroja Devi has acted in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Hindi films.  She has acted with MGR, Sivaji and Gemini in Tamil films .She has paired  With Rajkumar, Udaykumar and Kalyankumar  in Kannada films .She has acted opposite Nageswara Rao, NT Ramarao and Kantha Rao in Telugu films. She has also acted in Hindi films with Dilip Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Shammi Kapoor and Sunil Dutt.  However she has never acted in a Malayalam film. Why?

This was because of her mother Rudramma!  As Saroja Devi’s acting career began to unfold, She got some offers from Malayalam film directors .However she was told that she had to wear the traditional Kerala dress “Mundu”in the films . The Mundu is a  single  garment that covers the lower part of the body wrapped around the waist. The garment covering the upper parts is a “Melmundu” and/ or “ Neriyatu”.  The Kerala fimmakers  of that time wanted only the Mundu to be worn by Saroja Devi  on screen.

Rudramma would not allow it. She forbade her daughter  to act in the films and furthermore elicited a promise that Saroja should never act in  Malayalam films. Saroja Devi never breached that promise.

No Swimsuits or Sleeveless Blouses

Two other  conditions imposed on  the daughter by the  mother was that Saroja Devi should  never wear sleeveless blouses or swimsuits in films . The daughter  obeyed  her mother faithfully. She always dressed in a Saree, Shalvar Kameez  or Churidar on screen.

Despite these taboos, Saroja Devi was regarded as a fashion icon by women of her times .Her hairstyles including  “Irattaip Pinnal”( double plaits )and  “Kondais”(hairbuns), her jewellery especially her ear rings, necklaces and bangles,, her Sarees and Churidhars ,  were all eagerly  copied by young women  of a by gone era.

Another unique feature of Saroja Devi in Tamil films was her   voice and diction. She had a chirpy birdsong like voice . The way she spoke was quite lively and flippant. Her  caressing Tamil accent was childlike and somewhat saucy . This was commented upon negatively when she was acting with MGR . But MGR silenced the critics saying  she will  set the trend for a new form of Tamil known as “Saroja Devi Thamizh”.

“Kannadathup Paingkili”

MGR’s words were prophetic. Tamil fans relished  the way Saroja Devi spoke Tamil on screen so much  that they  bestowed the title “Kannadathup Paingkili” (sweet voiced  Kannada parrot) upon her.

“Abhinaya Saraswathy”

Another plus point was Saroja Devi’s expressive eyes .She could express different emotions through her eyes without speaking a word .This  too was duly  recognized. She was honoured in 1965  with the title “Abhinaya Saraswathy” meaning the  Goddess Saraswathy  of expression. The title was given to  her her by the state govt of Mysore as Karnataka was known then.

Apart from her melodious voice and chirpy accent,  the way she walked on screen at times was also attractive. The camera would focus  deliberately on her back as she walked. There is a seductive walk described as the “Gaja Gamini” or she -elephant walk  in Vatsayana’s Kama Sutra. North Indian literature  has many references  to Gaja   Gamini  as  the  majestic gait of a female elephant.

The famous painter M.F.Husain was so impressed and fascinated by the Gaja Gamini that he made a film titled “Gaja Gamini”starring the beautiful Madhuri Dixit. The Gaja Gamini inspired movements such as the swaying of hips is perceived as an elegant dance form.

In recent times the popular TV series “Heeramandi”(the diamond bazaar) by Sanjay Leela Bansali has actress Aditi Rao Hydari displaying the Gaja Gamini in a few dance sequences .Shades of Gaja Gamini are also discernible in the performances of Madhubala during the song sequence “Mohe Panghat Pe” in “Mughal -e -Azam and Deepika Padukone in the song  “Mohe Rang Do Laal”  from “Bajirao Mastani”.

Among South Indian actresses it is only Saroja Devi   who  reportedly performerd the Gaja Gamini walk on screen. Saroja Devi was therefore not merely a South Indian  actress who talked the  sweet talk of a Kannada parrot but also one who walked the seductive walk of the Gaja Gamini in films.

When Saroja Devi began acting in Tamil films playback singers like Jikki, P.Leela and P.Susheela voiced for her on screen.  However it was Susheela who sang for Saroja Devi in most of her Tamil films as her career  progressed The solos, duets and dances picturized on Saroja Devi are innumerable.

Among some of the memorable ones are -“Unnaik Kandu Naan Vaada,Paaal Vannam Paruvam Kandu, Kodi Sainthathum Kaatru Vanthadhaa, Aalayamaniyin Osaiyai ,Kaadhal Siraginil, Naan Paesa Ninaippathellam, Ennai Yaarendru, Anbulla Athaan  Vanakkam, Andru Vanthathum  Idhae Nilaa, Thottaal Poo Malarum, Ponnezhil Poothathu, Sangae Muzhangu, Kumarip Pennin Ullathiley, Sittukkuruvi Mutham Koduthu, Love Birds Love Birds, Idhaya Veenai Thoongum poadhu,Paeraich CSollalaamaa, Vaadiyammaa Vaadi, Sirithu Sirithu, Kaavaerik Karaiyirukku, Vannakkizhi Sonna Mozhi,  Kannaana Kannanukku Avasaramaa etc.

The predominantly Kannada speaking Karnataka state was earlier known as the state of Mysore. It was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The politics of Karnataka  revolves primarily around two caste groups known as the Lingayaths and Vokkaligas. Saroja Devi   is  a  Vokkaliga and is  regarded as an icon  of that community.

Saroja Devi has been an open supporter of the Congress party. She was an ardent admirer of former Prime minister Indira Gandhi.There  had  been  several requests   by former Karnataka chief ministers like Devaraj Urs, Gundu Rao and SM Krishna that the actress should contest Karnataka state elections on the Congress party ticket. Former PM Rajiv Gandhi wanted her to contest Lok Sabha elections  from the Mandya  electorate as the Congress candidate. Saroja Devi  declined all these invitations politely.

The awards and accolades  showered upon Saroja Devi  are myriad. Chief among them are the Padma shri and Padma Bhushan awarded by the Govt of India, the Kalaimaamani awarded by the Tamil Nadu Govt, the Lifetime achievement award given by the Indian Government and the “Filmfare

magazine’s lifetime achievement award .She also received  a honorary doctorate from the Bangalore university in 2006..

Saroja Devi married  Sri Harsha in  March  1967 .He was an engineer by profession. She gave up acting for a while after marriage .Her enlightened husband however encouraged her to resume her acting career. She did so.

This second phase was quite productive .Saroja Devi acted in many films in this post -marriage period. The bulk of the films were  in Kannada but some of her  finest Tamil films like “Panamaa Paasamaa”, “Thenum Paalum” “Thaamarai Nenjam” and “Kula Vilakku” were all in her post-marriage phase.

The couple had first adopted Saroja Devi’s sister’s daughter Puvaneswari who died at a young  age.Thereafet two others ,a boy named  Gautham Ramachandran and a daughter Indira were adopted. Sri Harsha died in 1986. Saroja Devi did not marry again.

The death of Saroja Devi on July 14th  2025  was mourned widely. She was regarded as an iconic treausure of India in general and Karnataka in particular.   Her body was kept for viewing at her Bengaluru home on July 14th evening and 1uly 15th morning .Her body was taken in a lengthy procession to her native village Dashavara in Channapatna, Bengaluru South district, on Tuesday 15th evening.

After last rites were observed according to Vokkaliga customs, a  grand funeral was  conducted with state honours. Among those who attended the funeral was  Karnataka Deputy chief minister  D.K. Shivakumar.  Thus ended the life of a beautiful and talented filmstar who  captivated  crores of fans  through her acting on screen.
