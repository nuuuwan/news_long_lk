Are 17.1 million voters ready to entrust the destinies of this nation to a convict who has violated the fundamental rights of the people of this country, for the next five years? – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The simple question that comes to the mind of any fair minded reader is that did all these help and assistance by the Indian government, the IMF, the WHO, the World Bank and various other friendly countries like China and Japan come only because of RW? What a joke. What an insult to these countries and global organisations. They were offered for the people of Sri Lanka, not to the President. Besides all the loans obtained by Sri Lanka have to be repaid by the people of this country with interest after all. Even if Battaramulle Seelarathana Thera was the president at this difficult time, those creditors and international establishments would have given this assistance to Sri Lanka

The Presidential election slated to be held on 21 September has a few characteristics not experienced by the voter at previous elections since the universal franchise was introduced to this country in 1931. This election has fielded the largest number of candidates ever together with about 35 dud or dummy candidates among the full complement of 38 with one dead.

A big majority out of these candidates in the fray except the top four Presidential hopefuls think that appearing before the TV camera and a few minutes of free publicity across the country at the Election Commission (EC) premises on the nomination day is worth the deposit they place before tendering nominations. Many of them do this as a past time every five years when the presidential elections are held.

Independent judges are a nightmare for would be dictators

One among the top four candidates who has been convicted by the highest court in the land is the most crucial issue that has baffled the voter at this election. Incidentally he is the Executive President of the country. The uniqueness of this election is President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) who has been convicted by the Supreme Court for the violation of the fundamental rights of 22 million people of this country and also for the contravention of the Constitution pleads with voters to elect him as the next Executive President of Sri Lanka. Are 17.1 million voters ready to entrust the destinies of this nation to a convict who has violated the fundamental rights of the people of this country, for the next five years? In the last eight presidential elections held from 1982 to 2019, Sri Lanka voters haven’t confronted an unpalatable but crucial issue like this that has made their right to vote a difficult task.

As I pointed out in one of my previous writings in the DFT, RW has happened to be at the right place at the right time that incidentally has gifted him with a god given bonanza in the form of Executive Presidency after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in March 2022 as a result of the Aragalaya, staged against the Rajapaksa regime.

RW has a plethora of reasons to remain in power by any means whatsoever. The latest episode is the conviction of him by the Supreme Court for the violation of the Constitution and his failure as the Minister of Finance to release the funds necessary to conduct the Local Government polls which was scheduled to be held on 9 March 2023.

He has repeatedly ignored and refused instructions issued by the Supreme Court to release at least a part of the Rs. 10 billion to the Election Commission (EC) allocated by the Budget 2023 and passed by the Parliament as election expenses. He not only belittled, vilified and insulted the highest court in the country and its judges but also mocked the Supreme Court by saying ‘there is no election to be held and therefore EC does not need money’.

The top priority of an Executive President is to protect the Constitution. Protection of the Constitution cannot be expected from a President who derides, insults and reprimands judges of the highest court of the country and deliberately disregards the orders given by the Supreme Court. This is in spite of RW giving a pledge before the Chief Justice on 21 July 2022 that said ‘I, Ranil Wickremesinghe do solemnly declare and affirm that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka” at his swear in and assuming duties as the Executive President of the country to complete the butt end of the presidency of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Not satisfied with his high handed attitude towards the Supreme Court, he had the audacity to say in a public meeting after the ruling given by the Supreme Court on 22 August convicting him for the violation of fundamental rights of the people that he did not regret for the postponement of the LG polls and he didn’t violate FR as the hunger of the people was more important than protecting the FR.

As a habit he does not honour the rulings given by the highest Court of the country. When the Supreme Court ruled that the expulsion of ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) was in accordance with the law and thereby lost their parliamentary membership and ministerial positions, RW merely changed their title from the ‘cabinet minister’ to ‘presidential adviser’ and appointed them to top Government posts accompanied with all the privileges and perks they enjoyed as cabinet ministers.

When the Supreme Court ordered to remove former IGP Deshabandu Thennakoon from his post as he is a convict for the violation of fundamental rights with a qualified senior police officer who fits the high post, RW did not obey the order. He in an indecent haste placed deposits as a candidate of the Presidential poll and declared that he was not in a position to make new appointments as he was a Presidential candidate. But he had the effrontery to appoint a number of politicians as ministers after they declared their support to him. This is a clear and outrageous affront to the Supreme Court and to honourable judges.

The last bastion of relief and for solace of an average citizen who does not have political, financial or social standing in a country that practices democratic form of governance is undoubtedly the judiciary. That is why the adjudication of fundamental rights has been entrusted with the Supreme Court by the basic law of the country.

If the head of state of a country deliberately breaches that right and rebukes the judges, it is a serious matter that connotes autocratic tendencies. The arrogance, selfishness and greed to power will not let such politicians lose their grip on power under any circumstances.

A defeat at the 21 September Presidential election will be the end of the world for RW and his fellow travellers who are facing a series of court cases. Leave alone winning the Presidential poll but they must pay attention to get elected to parliament at the general election that will follow soon after the Presidential election. Opposition and Samagi Janabala Sadanaya (SJS) leader Sajith Premadasa has already declared that he would dissolve parliament in weeks, if not in days after 22 September.

Venla Stang and Hannah Van Dijcke of the New York based Human Rights Foundation (HRF) in their recent analysis on autocratic propensity among certain rulers say that “independent judges are nightmare for would be dictators. They have the immense power to overturn the abusive actions of creeping authoritarian regimes by acquitting dissidents of bogus charges, holding regime officials accountable or upholding free and fair elections’. Because of judges’ essential checking power, authoritarian regimes across the globe regularly attack them”.

The sword of Damocles

RW has been charged in a lawsuit filed by 108 victims of the Easter Sunday bomb blast that took place on 21 April 2019, for negligence and failure to prevent the terrorist attack as the sitting Prime Minister. However, after becoming the President he has been released based on presidential immunity by the Colombo District Court. He is bound to rename as an accused if and when he lost the presidential race on this 21st.

The prime suspect of Sri Lanka’s biggest bank robbery – the Central Bank bond scam – Arjuna Mahendran under oath before the parliamentary oversight Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has said that he had only followed the Prime Minister RW’s instructions in robbing the big bank.

Soon after the formation of the Yahapalana government in January 2015, RW brought the Central Bank under his Ministry of Economic Development and Policy Making from the Finance Ministry. Handpicked his bosom buddy Singapore national Arjuna Mahendran as the governor of the Central Bank despite heavy protest from many a cabinet colleague including President Maithripala Sirisena. Outcome of this daylight robbery is history.

An SJS government expects to probe the alleged VFS visa scam carried out under the watch of President Wickremesinghe. The opposition charges that the ill lucre involved with the VFS visa fraud is higher than the money plundered through the Central Bank bond scam.

Opposition and SJS leader Sajith Premadasa has given a firm pledge that he would take immediate steps after swearing in on 22 September as the ninth Executive President to frame charges against all those allegedly involved in the Central Bank robbery, Easter Sunday bomb explosion, VFS fraud, who have been convicted by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights of the people and those who have purposefully insulted, ridiculed and belittled the Supreme Court. In that case, RW stands highly vulnerable for a chain of lawsuits to be filed against him after this 22nd. The lawsuits are hanging above Ranil’s and his colleague’s heads like the sword of Damocles day in – day out. Under these circumstances, losing the Presidential poll is absolutely the end of the world to all of them.

Jumping into the cesspit of rogues?

One of the main slogans of RW is Sajith did not accept the premiership when offered to him by President Rajapaksa.

Yes, indeed. It is understandable as the refusal to accept the premiership comes from a national leader who aspires to become the undisputed leader with a mandate of the nation. To ascend to that exalted position one must need to have a huge courage, acumen and statesmanship to turn down a request made by the head of state to take up the second most powerful position of the country. Don’t forget the fact that this is a country where politicians are ready to stoop to any level that includes staging of conspiracies, killing opponents and billions of rupees exchanging hands to grab power.

With only the support of 52 members in parliament, on whose dictates he was to run the administration? Sajith was not ready to run a government under dictates of the Rajapaksa Company and the SLPP which are full of thieves, rogues, convicts, bribe and commission takers, ransom takers and even convicted murderers. He was not ready to assume power even for a few months without a clear mandate from the people either. That was why he with his head held high demanded President Rajapaksa to give him a firm word on the day of his resignation from the presidency which Gota refused.

It is through this sordid transformation of incidents and the interregnum to which RW gleefully jumped and took over the premiership. It was a god given opportunity for a political refugee who had been rejected, refused and condemned by more than two dozens of times over 30 years by the people of this country. “You don’t check the teeth of a gifted horse’ after all, do you?

What RW and his associates cannot stomach is Sajith’s refusal to jump into this cesspit. If he was shortsighted, power hungry and foolish enough to grab this opportunity, he would have been in the same boat by now with Ranil and his fellow travellers experiencing the curse, abuse and insults of a nation. No one curses him with thunder bolts on his head. How many politicians who have rallied round RW will become political fugitives after 21 September is anybody’s guess. Does a decent young woman with an unblemished character ever accept a request from a madam to join her bordello? Not at all!

Any Sri Lankan with an unbiased and apolitical mindset can witness the huge popularity and love the people anoint with Sajith in all parts of the country he visits during his wonderful and highly successful election campaign. What would have been his position today if he accepted RW’s pleas to join him?

The Bard on Avon in his play ‘Julius Caesar’ has famously said that ‘Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion’.

Sajith in his entire political career has not only behaved true to this popular adage of Shakespeare but has been above of any allegations in his conduct.

This is the difference between Sajith and other politicians. He has been careful to conduct himself by completely distancing not only from suspicions but from any allegations.

RW in his desperation not to accept defeat has spread a lot of falsehoods. He is trying hard to convince the electorate that it was he who put an end to oil and gas queues, steadied the economy and started talks with the IMF. Wrong and absolute lies.

Gas and oil queues vanished because Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2022 provided a credit facility of $ 4 billion to Sri Lanka Government as our long standing and traditional friend. The World Bank loaned $ 400 million at the same time. Sri Lanka suspended debt servicing with announcement of bankruptcy in April, 2022. The WHO supplied medicinal drugs to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who launched talks with the IMF in March 2022 to obtain a bailout package of $ 3 billion approximately on the insistence of the main opposition, SJB.

This chain of funding and assistance contributed to strengthen the foreign reserves of the country and thereby facilitated the import of gas, oil, coal and essential commodities with foreign banks resuming accepting LoCs issued by Sri Lankan commercial banks.

The length of queues before filling stations shops and retail outlets further dwindled as people did not have money in their pockets as there were hundreds of thousands of layoffs, collapse of micro, small and medium level industries and hundreds of thousands of self-employments.

The simple question that comes to the mind of any fair minded reader is that did all these help and assistance by the Indian government, the IMF, the WHO, the World Bank and various other friendly countries like China and Japan come only because of RW? What a joke. What an insult to these countries and global organisations. They were offered for the people of Sri Lanka, not to the President. Besides all the loans obtained by Sri Lanka have to be repaid by the people of this country with interest after all. Even if Battaramulle Seelarathana Thera was the president at this difficult time, those creditors and international establishments would have given this assistance to Sri Lanka.

President and the members of his economic team such as Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, cabinet minister and former tuition master Bandula Gunawardana, state ministers Shehan Semasinghe and Ranjith Syambalapitiya keep saying that the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program signed with Sri Lanka cannot be changed or reformed. They say if any new administration scheduled to be established after the Presidential poll resorts to renegotiate the EFF program with the world body, it will bring disaster to the country.

The IMF prefers to deal with a Government that has the people’s mandate

These doomsday prophets market extremely negative and stupid falsehoods for their own survival. They make this canard compatible with their knowledge and the capacity of understanding the economics, monetary deals with global financial agencies and their protocol, debt servicing and restructuring et al. Sadly, they are not ready to accept the fact that there are highly qualified and globally renowned professionals who are capable of dealing with all these issues successfully for better deals and take the country out of the current economic, political and social mess in a targeted time under a Government to be formed after 21 September. These pessimists claim that they are the one and only saviours born to resurrect the motherland from the current disaster.

President RW also preaches about a possible collapse of the Sri Lanka-IMF agreement in the event of toppling of his Government on coming 21st.

The head of the IMF mission who is in charge of the EFF program with Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer on conclusion of the second review of the EFF said in Colombo on 14 June 2024 that the IMF was in agreement to adjust the program to align with the election, opened to alternatives by a new administration while adhering to bail out benchmarks.

After the IMF initially agreed to offer Sri Lanka the EFF of $ 3 billion in September, 2022, Breuer highlighted the IMF’s preference to negotiate with a government that commands a people’s mandate.

Each and every occasion SJB leader Sajith Premadasa and his team of economic experts met the IMF mission in the last two years, they have categorically pointed out that a future SJB government would introduce more people-friendly reforms to the staff level agreement signed with the IMF and Breuer has agreed to cooperate with the new Government.

Therefore the claim by RW and his team of storytellers that IMF agreement cannot be reformed or changed is an absolute lie. The claim that if any changes or reforms were introduced to the IMF-Sri Lanka agreement it would spell catastrophic consequences to Sri Lanka is also an absolute lie.

The doomsday prophets of the Government are trying hard to convince the people that a slightest change to the IMF agreement and a deviation from the IMF program would bring total disaster to the national economy and Sri Lanka would plunge into an abyss which is a subterfuge they hide behind.

No one must worry on these illusions. There are better and highly qualified professionals to deal with the economic woes of this country and deal with the IMF in a more pragmatic and results oriented policy framework with the blessings and in full agreement of the world body.

The agreement signed by the Sri Lanka Government with the IMF highlights the necessity of ”reducing corruption, vulnerabilities through improving fiscal transparency and public financial management introducing a stronger anti-corruption legal framework and conducting and in-depth governance diagnostic supported by IMF technical assistance.

But alas, President RW has honoured the agreement by gleefully obtaining the support of convicted gold smugglers, ransom and bribe takers, money launderers and all other corrupt and convicted politicians snatched away from the SLPP.

If that is not enough, he uses state assets all and sundry for his political campaign with no fear or shame despite guidelines issued by the Election Commission for presidential candidates.

The use of state assets to promote himself by RW is well documented in the mainstream and social media in the last few months. It is completely uncharacteristic of him as he has shown sham sympathy to the marginalised and down trodden Sri Lankans as never before by distributing land deeds and rice, promising various benefits to public servants, farmers, fisher folk et al. We haven’t seen this compassion in RW in his political career ever.

Sri Lanka has fulfilled all parameters to be branded as a bankrupt, failed and pariah state in the eyes of the global community.

First and foremost, it was the biggest insult and ill treatment on the Muslim community when burial of Muslim patients who died of COVID-19 infection was prohibited by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa regime aided and abetted by the only Muslim minister of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa cabinet Ali Sabry who now toes the line of his new master RW.

Ali Sabry it seems has never thought of forbidding the burial of dead Muslims was sacrilegious and hurt the feelings of his fellow mosque goers.

For his credit, opposition and SJS leader Sajith has raised his voice and protested in and out of parliament against the unethical and indecent act of forcing the cremation of dead Muslim nationals.

The latest report on Sri Lanka issued by the office of the United Nations’ Human Rights Commissioner (UNHRC) Volker Turk has critiqued Sri Lanka’s human right record under the incumbent regime of President Wickremesinghe in an extremely harsh manner.

He is not happy with the appointment of the disgraced IGP Deshabandu Thennakoon by RW despite the Supreme Court findings that he was responsible for committing torture in 2010. Has reservations on what Turk terms as ‘heavy handed operation known as Yukthiya with the stated aim to control drug menace.

“The deployment of military personnel in this operation represents a troubling escalation in militarisation of the drug law enforcement,” he says.

The Online Safety Act, Anti-Terrorism Bill, NGO Supervision and Registration Bill and Sri Lanka Telecommunication Bill introduced this year by the Government have raised concerns of the UNHRC. The world body further says that the vague definition of offences, broad powers conferred on the authorities to enforce the laws, disproportionate penalties and inadequate or absent judicial oversight incorporated in these pieces of legislations will not auger well for the smooth administration of justice.

“As Sri Lanka approaches Presidential and Parliamentary elections, it has an opportunity to recommit to the transformational changes demanded by a broad cross section of Sri Lankans who protested in 2022,” the UNHRC adds further.
