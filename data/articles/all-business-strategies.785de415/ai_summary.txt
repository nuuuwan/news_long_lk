Strategies can be categorised into four types based on how innovative they are: adaptations of successful strategies from one's own industry, importing strategies from other industries, combining strategies from multiple industries, and creating entirely new strategies from scratch. The article uses various examples to illustrate each category. For instance, businesses like Chinese firm Shein and German company Rocket Internet have utilised successful adaptations of existing tactics within their sectors. On another hand, the 'store-within-a-store' strategy of Best Buy and the subscription-based business model of European tool manufacturer Hilti are examples of companies importing strategies from other industries. Spotify's fusion of typical music streaming with social networking shows the combination of strategies from different territories. Lastly, Elon Musk's SpaceX and Airbnb manifests strategies entirely created from scratch putting the innovativeness to the limit. The more a strategy deviates from familiarity, the higher is its demand for creativity, industry knowledge and deep reflection.
