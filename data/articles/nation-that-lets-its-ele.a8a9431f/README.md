236 elephants killed in 2025

I write this with deep sadness and outrage. As of 15 June, 236 elephants have been killed this year alone, that’s more than one elephant every single day. And many of these deaths are not natural. They are brutal, painful, and preventable.

This is not just a tragedy. This is a crime against our nation. We are losing one of our greatest treasures, our elephants, due to short-sighted decisions, political greed, and sheer negligence.

Majority are Buddhist in this country. We speak of compassion. Our monks preach loving kindness. But what have we learned if we silently watch these magnificent beings suffer and die in agony? Isn’t this a direct insult to the Buddha’s teachings?

The Government holds the responsibility to protect our wildlife. These animals don’t vote, but they are part of our national identity, our heritage. They are not a nuisance, they are a gift. Giving weapons to villagers to protect crops, while elephants die in the process, is not a solution. Handing over protected lands to win votes is not governance, it’s betrayal.

Elephant corridors are blocked. Forests are shrinking. The animals have nothing to eat. So they wander hungry, desperate and then they are killed. This is cruelty. This is State-sponsored extinction.

We don’t lack experts. We have world-renowned conservationists like Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando and Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya. Why aren’t they given the power to lead? Why are political egos getting in the way of real solutions?

Policies don’t protect animals, implementation does. Beautiful environmental plans mean nothing if they remain documents. We need action, not slogans.

I urge every citizen, especially our youth, do not be silent. This is your country. This is your wildlife. Speak up, act, demand accountability. If we don’t, there may come a day when we’ll have to show our children photos of elephants because there won’t be any left in the wild.
