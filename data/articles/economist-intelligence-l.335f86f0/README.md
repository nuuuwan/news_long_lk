LONDON,  July 15th 2025 — ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE (EIU) today announced that it has launched the Democracy Index and the updated Liveability Index on Snowflake Marketplace. The Democracy Index offers nearly 20 years of historical data to enable finance, corporate and government customers to understand how political shifts across 165 independent countries and two territories are shaping market stability, investment risks and policymaking. The Liveability Index scores 173 cities across five broad categories: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure, benchmarking perceptions of development and support policies and investment decisions.

Economist Intelligence quantifies macro and geopolitical complexity to make it decision-ready. We are committed to enabling our customers to consume our content via the channels they use most, and to this end we are extremely excited to collaborate with Snowflake to bring the Democracy and Liveability data products  to their platform and leverage the scale and capabilities they offer to bring this data to more users.
