    "The cultural sector has become one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, representing 6.1% of the global economy, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The global value of the sector\u2019s creative industries is estimated at $4.3 trillion annually and represents 50 million jobs worldwide.",
    "In Saudi Arabia, the cultural sector is making major strides. Driven by a commitment to preserving and showcasing its abundant history, national identity, and heritage, Saudi Arabia prioritizes the cultural sector as a key driver of its further development. This strategic focus aligns seamlessly with the diversification goals outlined in the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Culture (MOC) in 2018, 11 cultural commissions now enhance the sector\u2019s influence, with an economic contribution slated to reach 3% of the gross domestic product by 2030.",
    "Since its establishment, MOC has added 138 creative-industry jobs to the Saudi Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC), and cultural tourism increased 109% from 2019 to 2022, with 18 million local tourist trips now involving cultural activities.",
    "The Saudi cultural sector has expanded in large part due to the investment of many private entities, which have served as catalysts for growth in disciplines including fashion, film, visual arts, literature, publishing, and translation, among others. Several case studies in these areas offer insights into the progress and future of Saudi Arabia\u2019s cultural sector and reveal the opportunities, challenges, and investment potential of these emerging industries.",
    "Pioneering the Saudi Art Scene",
    "Before the concept of cultural sectors had been fully developed, artists, patrons, and galleries operated within a limited circle. Recognizing the need to support art and artists, Hamza Serafi and Muhammad Hafiz founded ATHR Gallery in 2009 to help establish a local and international artists\u2019 network.",
    "As a pioneer of the Kingdom\u2019s visual arts scene, ATHR has become a platform for Saudi artists and creatives to show their work, access international platforms, obtain funding, and benefit from educational opportunities. ATHR collaborates with a diverse group of 27 renowned and emerging artists whose work has appeared in such esteemed institutions as the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, the British Museum in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.",
    "The Visual Arts Commission, along with the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, has provided a prominent platform for connecting artists and exhibitions in the Kingdom\u2019s growing and diverse artistic communities with the global art scene.",
    "By creating these opportunities for Saudi artists to showcase their creativity locally, regionally, and internationally, ATHR\u2019s support is helping to raise the value of Saudi art exports by an estimated 1.5% annually, expected to reach $46 million in 2026.",
    "Podcasting and Publishing",
    "The podcast industry, barely two decades old, had an estimated value of nearly $4 billion by the end of 2023. Saudis are increasingly tuning in, and with Arabic-language content constituting just 1% of podcasts, the medium has enormous growth potential to reach the world\u2019s 400 million native Arabic speakers.",
    "Since 2015, content company Thmanyah has grown Saudi audiences\u2019 interest in the abundant heritage of the Arabic language through a portfolio of brands that includes Thmanyah Films, live-event production company Usfurayah, cultural and finance newsletters, and 12 podcasts about business, health, sports, and culture. Five Thmanyah podcasts are among Apple\u2019s top 20 Arabic-language programs, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s top podcast, \u201cFinjan\u201d (\u201cCoffee Cup\u201d), featuring Thmanyah founder Abdulrahman Abumalih\u2019s weekly interviews with notable experts and professionals in culture, social trends, politics, health, and sports.",
    "Given the intense competition for audiences from various mass media and social media platforms, MOC\u2019s support in the sector was essential to the success of organizations like 1949 and Thamanyah, which specialized in podcasts about Saudi culture.",
    "Saudi Fashion on the Global Runway",
    "Saudi designer Mohammed Ashi established his high-end Parisian fashion house in 2007 with three employees on a $60,000 investment. Ashi has since blossomed into a multinational enterprise with 120 employees in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, and Switzerland, achieving sustainable growth by reinvesting its profits back into the company. Mohammed Ashi is one of the first Gulf Arabs to appear in the official program of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture.",
    "MOC\u2019s Fashion Commission, established in 2020, plays a pivotal role in supporting the industry. Beyond offering financial support by such things as funding live fashion shows, the commission\u2019s Saudi 100 Brands Program offers emerging designers access to the Fashion Commission\u2019s network, as well as consultation and guidance from Ashi and other established industry players.",
    "With such investment underscoring the commission\u2019s commitment to nurturing fashion design talent in Saudi Arabia, Ashi is now expanding in the Kingdom, bringing an anticipated 20% increase in revenue. \u201cMohammed Ashi is a leader of Saudi fashion, and his creative force has made an invaluable contribution to Saudi\u2019s fashion,\u201d says Burak Cakmak, CEO of the Fashion Commission.",
    "Investing in Creativity",
    "Through legislation, grants, and the provision of offices, studios, and production and development facilities, MOC aims to help fund cultural businesses and attract investment\u2014individual and private-sector, near- and long-term\u2014to help make their creative visions real.",
    "MOC\u2019s support for creative entrepreneurs, including ATHR Gallery, Thamanyah, Ashi, and many others, is boosting the cultural industry, encouraging more and more creators in Saudi Arabia to dream big.",
