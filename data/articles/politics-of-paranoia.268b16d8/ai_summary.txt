The National People's Power (NPP) Party, which is relatively new to Sri Lanka's political sphere, has created a sense of political panic among traditional parties due to its focus on systemic reform in the economy, politics, and culture. This fear has led the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) to propose delaying elections for two years. However, critics argue that despite the necessary changes the NPP proposes, its approach could lead to economic decline. This disagreement underpins an intergenerational struggle for political power in Sri Lanka, with increasing support from younger voters for the NPP. Currently, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and NPP are closely matched in the presidential race.
