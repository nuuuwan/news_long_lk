Opinions:
- Weerakkody’s article provides an overly positive narrative about President Wickremesinghe’s handling of the economic crisis. 
- Neoliberal policies have contributed to Sri Lanka’s current predicament and are detrimental to the Sri Lankan economy. 
- Countries such as Germany and South Korea which focused on building production economies have shown greater economic stability and growth. 
- Sri Lanka must transition from its reliance on neoliberal policies to a production-based economy to achieve long-term economic health and resilience. 
- Current neoliberal policies fail to address systemic issues within the education system and labor market in Sri Lanka.
- The same political figures who have contributed to the crisis cannot be the sole architects of its resolution, making the upcoming presidential election an opportunity for Sri Lankans to demand genuine leaders.  
- Despite acknowledging President Wickremesinghe’s efforts to manage the crisis, the writer believes it is necessary to critique his long-standing influence and the neoliberal policies contributing to the economic situation. 
- NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the only front-runner in the presidential race who sets hope on a production-based economy; he considers Wickremesinghe's and Premadasa's belief in crony capitalism detrimental.
