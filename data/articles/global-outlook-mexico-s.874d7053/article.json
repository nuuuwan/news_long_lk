    "In EIU\u2019s November 2024 Global Outlook video, principal economists Robert Wood and Andrew Viteritti discuss the outlook for Mexico under its new government, as well as expectations for US-Mexico relations after the US presidential election.",
    "After taking office on October 1st, Claudia Sheinbaum of the left-wing Movimiento Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional (Morena) began her presidency from a position of strength. She won the June election by a landslide, she enjoys the support of the popular former president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and her party holds supermajorities in the new Congress.",
    "However, questions remain about whether she will continue Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s nationalist and populist agenda. EIU expects Ms Sheinbaum to adopt a more pragmatic approach during her six-year term. However, political pressures, including from Morena hardliners, could weaken the more orthodox elements of her platform.",
    "\u201cEIU forecasts that Ms Sheinbaum will continue Mr\u00a0 L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s commitment to fiscal austerity, although she will have to balance this with her substantial spending plans. She will also maintain the state\u2019s strong role in the economy and will advance Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s controversial constitutional reforms. However, her agenda will differ from her predecessor\u2019s in its encouragement of private and foreign investment, the green transition and the development of infrastructure based on competitiveness rather than purely social priorities. How and whether she implements these plans will depend on her relationship with Congress and the results of the US election.\u201d",
    "Andrew Viteritti, Principal economist for LATAM, EIU",
    "The outcome of the US presidential election will significantly affect Mexico\u2019s outlook. There are large differences in the policy agendas of the two main candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, particularly on trade, immigration and border security. A Harris presidency would likely offer a more cooperative approach to Mexico. In contrast, a Trump presidency would strain the bilateral relationship. Regardless of the outcome, tensions are expected in areas such as Mexico\u2019s protectionism, the country\u2019s recent constitutional reforms and investments from China.",
    "EIU expects Mexico\u2019s economic growth to slow to 1.4% in 2024, down from 3.2% in 2023. Growth is forecast at 1.2% in 2025, with the economy firming up through to 2029, in line with an economic recovery in the US. In the short term, investors should closely monitor Ms Sheinbaum\u2019s budget proposal to Congress in November, the constitutional reform process and the outcome of the US presidential election.",
