California’s department of motor vehicles was a mess back in 2019. The state’s then-new governor, Gavin Newsom, described customers as “outraged” by their DMV experiences. It could take several hours to complete simple tasks like renewing a driver’s license. Ancient IT systems meant many transactions that could have been automated were dismal, in-person ordeals. Silos and mistrust within the department undermined collaboration and change. And frontline employees were demoralized and distressed.

That year, Governor Newsom hired veteran technology executive Steve Gordon to transform the DMV: to increase online services, improve service at field offices, and bolster employee morale. Gordon knew the DMV was in crisis when he took the job, and not just from the troubling statistics and press reports, but from his own visits to offices. At the San Jose DMV office Gordon visited while he was still considering the job, a long line formed at 6 a.m. — two hours before the doors would open at 8 a.m. One man even brought a lawn chair in anticipation of a long wait.

The Newsom administration expected Gordon to implement widespread improvements in this big, complicated, and troubled department — and to do it fast. That was a tall order, as the DMV has some 10,000 employees, 180 field offices, and an annual budget of $1.3 billion, all in a state with 27 million licensed drivers and 36 million registered vehicles. The pressure on Gordon’s team was amplified by a one-time $242 million budget bump to speed the DMV’s turnaround.

They rose to the challenge.

Two of us (Huggy and Robert) are academics who have devoted the last eight years to “The Friction Project” to uncover how leaders can make the right things easier and the wrong things harder in organizations. We were intrigued by the rapid repairs Gordon’s team made at the DMV.  So we joined up with Stanford case writer Michael Rothkopf, as well as a wonderful team at Stanford Business School, to work with Gordon and his colleagues to produce a multimedia case study, “Steve Gordon: Reducing Traffic Jams at The DMV,” available to download for free.

We could write an entire book about lessons from Gordon’s team about leading change in big organizations — especially those saddled by bad old habits and systems and immovable financial, legal, and political constraints. This article zeros in on how the team was able to improve the DMV so much and so fast thanks in part to Gordon beginning his tenure by doing something massively inefficient: wandering around.

The New Boss Visits All 180 DMV Field Offices

Gordon explained to us that because the DMV was in crisis and he faced intense pressure to fix it quickly, he lacked the luxury of taking 100 days “just to learn what’s going on” as he had in past leadership roles. His team went straight to work on updating the DMV’s ancient technologies and improving customer experiences.

Yet he slowed way down in one crucial way. During his first months on the job, Gordon visited all 180 DMV field offices, putting some 50,000 miles on his car in the process. That meant, for example, visiting the Crescent City office near the Oregon border, as well as the Chula Vista office some 850 miles away near the Mexican border. During each 30-minute to one-hour visit, Gordon described his plans for easing burdens on customers and employees and asked staffers to identify problems and propose solutions.

We call Gordon’s method “management by driving around” because it’s reminiscent of “management by wandering around” (MBWA), a term HP executive John Doyle coined in the early 1960s. As Doyle wrote in an email to Robert in 2019, he invented it after HP cofounders Bill Hewlett and David Packard visited his manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom in 1961. The duo “wandered around chatting with people, asking what they were doing, etc.” According to Doyle, these conversations motivated workers because Bill and Dave showed interest in them and came across as “normal folk.”

MBWA was embedded in the HP culture a couple years later when, at a senior leadership meeting, Doyle complained that “the rather quantitative MBAs [they] were hiring” were missing subtle and difficult-to-measure lessons and creating a soulless workplace. He described Bill and Dave’s method, arguing, “We need less of the MBA perspective and more MBWA, management by wandering around, action.” Doyle’s pleas “really enlivened the meeting and caught on in a big way.”

Virtues of Management by Driving Around

By 2024, Gordon’s team had sped up service at the DMV, built a more innovative and customer-focused culture, and cranked up customer satisfaction. Twice as many DMV services were available online in 2024 than in 2019. Lines at offices were shorter and moved faster, especially for millions of customers who made required in-person visits to obtain a Real I.D., a form of identification that will soon be mandated for air travel for all U.S. residents. A host of technology and workflow improvements, along with hard-working and well-trained frontline employees, cut the average time DMV customers spend at the clerk window to obtain a Real I.D. from 28 to eight minutes. And surveys of all 180 DMV field offices found that customer satisfaction with in-person visits rose from 2.5 on a 5-point scale in 2018 to 4.25 in 2023.

Gordon’s in-person visits to those 180 DMV offices helped his team make changes that spread and stuck — and serve customers faster. Here’s how.

It bought them time to make the right changes.

Gordon acted quickly to set high standards for the department’s staff of 10,000 and to start building a culture where when “we recognize what needs to be done, we do it, and we do it now.”

Yet there were many solutions to the DMV’s crisis that Gordon’s team knew would take time to figure out. The team realized that, for such unknowns, they were in what Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman called a “cognitive minefield.” That’s when people are confused or overwhelmed, when things are falling apart, and although they want to make things better, they don’t have a sufficient grasp of causes and remedies. In such cases, it’s wise to pause and assess the situation rather than do something rash and wrong.

All that driving around bought Gordon and his team precious time to think about, uncover, and develop better solutions. For example, Gordon and chief digital transformation officer Ajay Gupta found the 28 minutes the average customer spent at the window to get a Real I.D. to be unacceptable, but they needed time to figure out causes and remedies. Gordon’s office visits helped him identify unnecessary steps staffers at DMV headquarters had added — for example, a requirement that multiple team members review each application when a review by a single member was sufficient. Gordon, Gupta, and their team also slowed down to dissect how every step in the Real I.D. registration process unfolded and could be improved. According to Gordon, they were able to streamline the process so much because “[they] challenged every one of those steps,” asking questions like, “Does it come from a statute? A regulation? A policy? Is it a good idea? Is it a bad idea?”

It built trust with frontline employees.

In his early days at the DMV, Gordon discovered that “the prevailing culture at the time did not encourage employees to question the status quo or the wisdom of systems and processes that were negatively impacting the consumer experience.” Much as John Doyle learned from Bill Hewlett and David Packard some 60 years ago, Gordon believed that visiting all those field offices would help create trust among frontline employees — to feel a personal connection with their new boss, and be seen, heard, and understood, and to feel safer to speak up.

Gordon also found that some DMV leaders at Sacramento headquarters had never visited field offices themselves. So, he began “kicking people out of the nest.” Gordon was confident that building face-to-face relationships with frontline employees would make them more likely to buy into system-wide changes, rather than dragging their feet and resisting new practices.

It got them unfiltered ideas.

The Friction Project taught us that senior leaders who identify the causes of and remedies for broken bureaucracies are often skeptical of information filtered through the management levels between them and where the work is actually done. So, they bypass the hierarchy and learn directly from the people on the front lines.

For example, when Gordon visited field offices, employees told him about flawed systems, and sometimes offered ideas for repairs that he would never have uncovered if filtered by the DMV hierarchy. During one visit, Gordon pressed two frontline employees, Andrea and Samantha, to tell him about the most frustrating or confusing issue for DMV customers. They immediately identified the confusing organ donation questions on the driver’s license application. The opt-in/opt-out questions were so badly worded that it sounded as if “the DMV would try to remove an organ right there on the spot.” Those two employees then sketched out proposed changes in wording and formatting on sticky notes. Gordon took the notes back to the engineers at the DMV’s Sacramento headquarters, who implemented the changes.

It cranked up the emotions that propel change.

As Chip and Dan Heath document in Made to Stick, making rational and evidence-based arguments — especially through dull emails and memos packed with new expectations, procedures, and rules — is a lousy way to motivate people to change their behavior. Change is more likely to start, spread, and stick when messages are wrapped in compelling language and stories that trigger action-inspiring emotions including enthusiasm, empathy, anger, and pride.

Fortunately for the DMV, Steve Gordon was adept at telling stories that stirred emotions among employees that inspired them to help implement — rather than undermine — widespread improvements in customer service. Those visits Gordon made to all 180 field offices, as well as how he talked about the little setbacks and triumphs, were reminiscent of writer Joseph Campbell’s “hero’s journey”: The key character, who appeals to the audience and has a desirable goal, sets out on a difficult journey, encounters obstacles and setbacks, recruits allies, and assembles resources as it unfolds. And in the end, the hero reaches their goal.

Again and again, when we dissect what successful friction fixers do, we encounter leaders like Gordon who instill “authentic” (rather than “hubristic”) pride in others. In particular, the pride DMV employees felt about working together to speed service for their customers runs through these stories about Gordon’s journey. For example, when Gordon celebrated Andrea and Samantha, the two frontline employees who sketched out their ideas on sticky notes, he emphasized the pride they (and he) felt in their work. That story embodied the culture that Gordon wanted throughout the DMV.

Gordon told the story about Andrea and Samantha in a three-minute “Director’s Corner” video titled “Speak Up” that was shared with all DMV employees. The video included interviews with the duo to illustrate how, by looking around, employees who are curious about their work, pay attention to obstacles, and notice frustrations that customers face — and say something about it — can improve DMV services. In the video, Gordon urged employees to talk to their supervisors about such obstacles and frustrations or email him directly. He explained, “To continue improving, we need the ideas from those on the front lines to help us understand where the impediments are for our customers. We’re using this story to try to encourage more staff to give us feedback.”

Leaders and teams that make the right things easier and the wrong things harder in organizations treat friction fixing as a way of life. As one CEO told us about his company’s efforts to eliminate unnecessary meetings, such work is like “mowing the lawn”: Constant maintenance is required; there is no “one and done.”

That’s why, despite Steve Gordon’s pride that the DMV had improved customer service in so many ways in just five years, he emphasized, “We still have a lot more to do; we are certainly not celebrating in the end zone yet.” Above all, we are impressed by Gordon’s devotion to creating a culture at the DMV where, long after he and his team have moved on, people will question the status quo, move swiftly to prevent and repair the never-ending problems that arise in every organization, and “think of [themselves] as a competitive customer product and behave as if dissatisfied customers could take their business elsewhere.”
