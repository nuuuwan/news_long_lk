Three phases of India's general election for 2024 have been completed with voting for 283 out of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, and the election will conclude on June 1st. The voter turnout so far is somewhat lower than the previous election in 2019, attributed to extreme heatwaves and increased voter apathy. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to win the ballot with a respectable majority, despite a reduced turnout possibly translating to fewer seats. The re-election of BJP could deepen communal rifts due to their divisive agenda. The hostility between various parties has led to increased incendiary remarks. While the main electoral opposition, Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, struggles to establish itself, Congress's proposed socioeconomic changes risk alienating the urban populace.
