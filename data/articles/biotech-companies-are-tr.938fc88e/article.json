To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here.\u00a0 The outbreak of avian influenza on US dairy farms has started to make milk seem a lot less wholesome. Milk that\u2019s raw, or unpasteurized, can actually infect mice that drink it, and a few dairy workers have already caught the bug.\u00a0  The FDA says that commercial milk is safe because it is pasteurized, killing the germs. Even so, it\u2019s enough to make a person ponder a life beyond milk\u2014say, taking your coffee black or maybe drinking oat milk. But for those of us who can't do without the real thing, it turns out some genetic engineers are working on ways to keep the milk and get rid of the cows instead. They\u2019re doing it by engineering yeasts and plants with bovine genes so they make the key proteins responsible for milk\u2019s color, satisfying taste, and nutritional punch.",
    "The proteins they\u2019re copying are casein, a floppy polymer that\u2019s the most abundant protein in milk and is what makes pizza cheese stretch, and whey, a nutritious combo of essential amino acids that\u2019s often used in energy powders. Related StoryHow I learned to stop worrying and love fake meatLet\u2019s stop inventing reasons to reject cultured meat and other protein alternatives that could dramatically cut climate emissions.",
    "It\u2019s part of a larger trend of replacing animals with ingredients grown in labs, steel vessels, or plant crops. Think of the Impossible burger, the veggie patty made mouthwatering with the addition of heme, a component of blood that\u2019s produced in the roots of genetically modified soybeans.",
    "One of the milk innovators is Remilk, an Israeli startup founded in 2019, which has engineered yeast so it will produce beta-lactoglobulin (the main component of whey). Company cofounder Ori Cohavi says a single biotech factory of bubbling yeast vats feeding on sugar could in theory \u201creplace 50,000 to 100,000 cows.\u201d\u00a0 Remilk has been making trial batches and is testing ways to formulate the protein with plant oils and sugar to make spreadable cheese, ice cream, and milk drinks. So yes, we\u2019re talking \u201cprocessed\u201d food\u2014one partner is a local Coca-Cola bottler, and advising the company are former executives of Nestl\u00e9, Danone, and PepsiCo. But regular milk isn\u2019t exactly so natural either. At milking time, animals stand inside elaborate robots, and it looks for all the world as if they\u2019re being abducted by aliens. \u201cThe notion of a cow standing in some nice green scenery is very far from how we get our milk,\u201d says Cohavi. And there are environmental effects: cattle burp methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and a lactating cow needs to drink around 40 gallons of water a day.\u00a0 \u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dairy cows on the planet producing greenhouse waste, using a lot of water and land,\u201d says Cohavi. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the best way to produce food.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  For biotech ventures trying to displace milk, the big challenge will be keeping their own costs of production low enough to compete with cows. Dairies get government protections and subsidies, and they don\u2019t only make milk. Dairy cows are eventually turned into gelatin, McDonald\u2019s burgers, and the leather seats of your Range Rover. Not much goes to waste. At Alpine Bio, a biotech company in San Francisco (also known as Nobell Foods), researchers have engineered soybeans to produce casein. While not yet cleared for sale, the beans are already being grown on USDA-sanctioned test plots in the Midwest, says Alpine\u2019s CEO, Magi Richani.\u00a0 Richani chose soybeans because they\u2019re already a major commodity and the cheapest source of protein around. \u201cWe are working with farmers who are already growing soybeans for animal feed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we are saying, \u2018Hey, you can grow this to feed humans.\u2019 If you want to compete with a commodity system, you have to have a commodity crop.\u201d Alpine intends to crush the beans, extract the protein, and\u2014much like Remilk\u2014sell the ingredient to larger food companies.",
    "Everyone agrees that cow\u2019s milk will be difficult to displace. It holds a special place in the human psyche, and we owe civilization itself, in part, to domesticated animals. In fact, they\u2019ve\u00a0 left their mark in our genes, with many of us carrying DNA mutations that make cow\u2019s milk easier to digest.\u00a0\u00a0 But that\u2019s why it might be time for the next technological step, says Richani. \u201cWe raise 60 billion animals for food every year, and that is insane. We took it too far, and we need options,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need options that are better for the environment, that overcome the use of antibiotics, and that overcome the disease risk.\u201d It\u2019s not clear yet whether the bird flu outbreak on dairy farms is a big danger to humans. But making milk without cows would definitely cut the risk that an animal virus will cause a new pandemic. As Richani says: \u201cSoybeans don\u2019t transmit diseases to humans.\u201d  Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive Hungry for more from the frontiers of fromage? In the Build issue of our print magazine, Andrew Rosenblum tasted a yummy brie made only from plants. Harder to swallow was the claim by developer Climax Foods that its cheese was designed using artificial intelligence. The idea of using yeast to create food ingredients, chemicals, and even fuel via fermentation is one of the dreams of synthetic biology. But it\u2019s not easy. In 2021, we raised questions about high-flying startup Ginkgo Bioworks. This week its stock hit an all-time low of $0.49 per share as the company struggles to make \u2026 well, anything. This spring, I traveled to Florida to watch attempts to create life in a totally new way: using a synthetic embryo made in a lab. The action involved cattle at the animal science department of the University of Florida, Gainesville.  From around the web",
    "How many human bird flu cases are there? No one knows, because there\u2019s barely any testing. Scientists warn we\u2019re flying blind as US dairy farms struggle with an outbreak. (NBC)\u00a0\u00a0 Moderna, one of the companies behind the covid-19 shots, is seeing early success with a cancer vaccine. It uses the same basic technology: gene messages packed into nanoparticles. (Nature) It\u2019s the covid-19 theory that won\u2019t go away. This week the New York Times published an op-ed arguing that the virus was the result of a lab accident. We previously profiled the author, Alina Chan, who is a scientist with the Broad Institute. (NYTimes) Sales of potent weight loss drugs, like Ozempic, are booming. But it\u2019s not just humans who are overweight. Now the pet care industry is dreaming of treating chubby cats and dogs, too. (Bloomberg) hide"
