    "MIT Technology Review\u2019s What\u2019s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them\u00a0here. Drones have been a mainstay technology among militaries, hobbyists, and first responders alike for more than a decade, and in that time the range available has skyrocketed. No longer limited to small quadcopters with insufficient battery life, drones are aiding search and rescue efforts, reshaping wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and delivering time-sensitive packages of medical supplies. And billions of dollars are being plowed into building the next generation of fully autonomous systems.\u00a0  These developments raise a number of questions: Are drones safe enough to be flown in dense neighborhoods and cities? Is it a violation of people\u2019s privacy for police to fly drones overhead at an event or protest? Who decides what level of drone autonomy is acceptable in a war zone? Those questions are no longer hypothetical. Advancements in drone technology and sensors, falling prices, and easing regulations are making drones cheaper, faster, and more capable than ever. Here\u2019s a look at four of the biggest changes coming to drone technology in the near future.",
    "Police drone fleets Today more than 1,500 US police departments have drone programs, according to tracking conducted by the Atlas of Surveillance. Trained police pilots use drones for search and rescue operations, monitoring events and crowds, and other purposes. The Scottsdale Police Department in Arizona, for example, successfully used a drone to locate a lost elderly man with dementia, says Rich Slavin, Scottsdale\u2019s assistant chief of police. He says the department has had useful but limited experiences with drones to date, but its pilots have often been hamstrung by the \u201cline of sight\u201d rule from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The rule stipulates that pilots must be able to see their drones at all times, which severely limits the drone\u2019s range. Soon, that will change. On a rooftop somewhere in the city, Scottsdale police will in the coming months install a new police drone capable of autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing. Slavin says the department is seeking a waiver from the FAA to be able to fly its drone past the line of sight. (Hundreds of police agencies have received a waiver from the FAA since the first was granted in 2019.) The drone, which can fly up to 57 miles per hour, will go on missions as far as three miles from its docking station, and the department says it will be used for things like tracking suspects or providing a visual feed of an officer at a traffic stop who is waiting for backup.",
    "\u201cThe FAA has been much more progressive in how we\u2019re moving into this space,\u201d Slavin says. That could mean that around the country, the sight (and sound) of a police drone soaring overhead will become much more common.\u00a0 The Scottsdale department says the drone, which it is purchasing from Aerodome, will kick off its drone-as-first-responder program and will play a role in the department\u2019s new \u201creal-time crime center.\u201d These sorts of centers are becoming increasingly common in US policing, and allow cities to connect cameras, license plate readers, drones, and other monitoring methods to track situations on the fly. The rise of the centers, and their associated reliance on drones, has drawn criticism from privacy advocates who say they conduct a great deal of surveillance with little transparency about how footage from drones and other sources will be used or shared.\u00a0 In 2019, the police department in Chula Vista, California, was the first to receive a waiver from the FAA to fly beyond line of sight. The program sparked criticism from members of the community who alleged the department was not transparent about the footage it collected or how it would be used.\u00a0 Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, says the waivers exacerbate existing privacy issues related to drones. If the FAA continues to grant them, police departments will be able to cover far more of a city with drones than ever, all while the legal landscape is murky about whether this would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u00a0  \u201cIf there\u2019s an accumulation of different uses of this technology, we\u2019re going to end up in a world where from the moment you step out of your front door, you\u2019re going to feel as though you\u2019re under the constant eye of law enforcement from the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may have some real benefits, but it is also in dire need of strong checks and balances.\u201d Scottsdale police say the drone could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as responding to a burglary in progress or tracking a driver with suspected connection to a kidnapping. But the real benefit, Slavin says, will come from pairing it with other existing technologies, like automatic license plate readers and hundreds of cameras placed around the city. \u201cIt can get to places very, very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives us real-time intelligence and helps us respond faster and smarter.\u201d While police departments might indeed benefit from drones in those situations, Stanley says the ACLU has found that many deploy them for far more ordinary cases, like reports of a kid throwing a ball against a garage or of \u201csuspicious persons\u201d in an area. \u201cIt raises the question about whether these programs will just end up being another way in which vulnerable communities are over-policed and nickeled and dimed by law enforcement agencies coming down on people for all kinds of minor transgressions,\u201d he says.",
    "Drone deliveries, again Perhaps no drone technology is more overhyped than home deliveries. For years, tech companies have teased futuristic renderings of a drone dropping off a package on your doorstep just hours after you ordered it. But they\u2019ve never managed to expand them much beyond small-scale pilot projects, at least in the US, again largely due to the FAA\u2019s line of sight rules.\u00a0 But this year, regulatory changes are coming. Like police departments, Amazon\u2019s Prime Air program was previously limited to flying its drones within the pilot\u2019s line of sight. That\u2019s because drone pilots don\u2019t have radar, air traffic controllers, or any of the other systems commercial flight relies on to monitor airways and keep them safe. To compensate, Amazon spent years developing an onboard system that would allow its drones to detect nearby objects and avoid collisions. The company says it showed the FAA in demonstrations that its drones could fly safely in the same airspace as helicopters, planes, and hot air balloons.\u00a0 In May, Amazon announced the FAA had granted the company a waiver and permission to expand operations in Texas, more than a decade after the Prime Air project started. And in July, the FAA cleared one more roadblock by allowing two companies\u2014Zipline as well as Google\u2019s Wing Aviation\u2014to fly in the same airspace simultaneously without the need for visual observers.\u00a0 While all this means your chances of receiving a package via drone have ticked up ever so slightly, the more compelling use case might be medical deliveries. Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chains at the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis, has spent years researching how drones could conduct last-mile deliveries of vaccines, antivenom, organs, and blood in remote places. She says her studies have found drones to be game changers for getting medical supplies to underserved populations, and if the FAA extends these regulatory changes, it could have a real impact.\u00a0  That\u2019s especially true in the steps leading up to an organ transplant, she says. Before an organ can be transmitted to a recipient, a number of blood tests must be sent back-and-forth to make sure the recipient can accept it, which takes a time if the blood is being transferred by car or even helicopter. \u201cIn these cases, the clock is ticking,\u201d Enayati says. If drones were allowed to be used in this step at scale, it would be a significant improvement. \u201cIf the technology is supporting the needs of organ delivery, it\u2019s going to make a big change in such an important arena,\u201d she says. That development could come sooner than using drones for delivery of the actual organs, which have to be transported under very tightly controlled conditions to preserve them. Domesticating the drone supply chain Signed into law last December, the American Security Drone Act bars federal agencies from buying drones from countries thought to pose a threat to US national security, such as Russia and China. That\u2019s significant. China is the undisputed leader when it comes to manufacturing drones and drone parts, with over 90% of law enforcement drones in the US made by Shenzhen-based DJI, and many drones used by both sides of the war in Ukraine are made by Chinese companies.",
    "The American Security Drone Act is part of an effort to curb that reliance on China. (Meanwhile, China is stepping up export restrictions on drones with military uses.) As part of the act, the US Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit has created the Blue UAS Cleared List, a list of drones and parts the agency has investigated and approved for purchase. The list applies to federal agencies as well as programs that receive federal funding, which often means state police departments or other non-federal agencies.\u00a0 Since the US is set to spend such significant sums on drones\u2014with $1 billion earmarked for the Department of Defense\u2019s Replicator initiative alone\u2014getting on the Blue List is a big deal. It means those federal agencies can make large purchases with little red tape.",
    "Allan Evans, CEO of US-based drone part maker Unusual Machine, says the list has sparked a significant rush of drone companies attempting to conform to the US standards. His company manufactures a first-person view flight controller that he hopes will become the first of its kind to be approved for the Blue List. The American Security Drone Act is unlikely to affect private purchases in the US of drones used by videographers, drone racers, or hobbyists, which will overwhelmingly still be made by China-based companies like DJI. That means any US-based drone companies, at least in the short term, will only survive by catering to the US defense market.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBasically any US company that isn\u2019t willing to have ancillary involvement in defense work will lose,\u201d Evans says.\u00a0 The coming months will show the law\u2019s true impact: Because the US fiscal year ends in September, Evans says he expects to see a host of agencies spending their use-it-or-lose-it funding on US-made drones and drone components in the next month. \u201cThat will indicate whether the marketplace is real or not, and how much money is actually being put toward it,\u201d he says. Autonomous weapons in Ukraine The drone war in Ukraine has largely been one of attrition. Drones have been used extensively for surveying damage, finding and tracking targets, or dropping weapons since the war began, but on average these quadcopter drones last just three flights before being shot down or rendered unnavigable by GPS jamming. As a result, both Ukraine and Russia prioritized accumulating high volumes of drones with the expectation that they wouldn\u2019t last long in battle.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re having to rethink that approach, according to Andriy Dovbenko, founder of the UK-Ukraine Tech Exchange, a nonprofit that helps startups involved in Ukraine\u2019s war effort and eventual reconstruction raise capital. While working with drone makers in Ukraine, he says, he has seen the demand for technology shift from big shipments of simple commercial drones to a pressing need for drones that can navigate autonomously in an environment where GPS has been jammed. With 70% of the front lines suffering from jamming, according to Dovbenko, both Russian and Ukrainian drone investment is now focused on autonomous systems.",
    "That\u2019s no small feat. Drone pilots usually rely on video feeds from the drone as well as GPS technology, neither of which is available in a jammed environment. Instead, autonomous drones operate with various types of sensors like LiDAR to navigate, though this can be tricky in fog or other inclement weather. Autonomous drones are a new and rapidly changing technology, still being tested by US-based companies like Shield AI. The evolving war in Ukraine is raising the stakes and the pressure to deploy affordable and reliable autonomous drones.\u00a0\u00a0 The transition toward autonomous weapons also raises serious yet largely unanswered questions about how much humans should be taken out of the loop in decision-making. As the war rages on and the need for more capable weaponry rises, Ukraine will likely be the testing ground for if and how the moral line is drawn. But Dovbenko says stopping to find that line during an ongoing war is impossible.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a moral question about how much autonomy you can give to the killing machine,\u201d Dovbenko says. \u201cThis question is not being asked right now in Ukraine because it\u2019s more of a matter of survival.\u201d hide"
