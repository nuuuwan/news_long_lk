1. 🇺🇸 US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, is not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to US Congress. 🎙️
2. 🌍 This decision by Harris is welcomed by progressive thinkers globally. 
3. 🏛️ Harris' absence comes in light of the International Court of Justice's assertion that Israel's 57-year occupation of Palestinian lands is "unlawful". ⚖️
4. 🇮🇱 The court advises Israel to promptly end its occupation, evacuate settlers, and make reparations for damages caused. 
5. ⚠️ The court also urges countries worldwide to refrain from supporting any Israeli presence in occupied Palestinian territories. 
6. 🙅‍♀️ Harris' move is unlikely to affect the long-standing US-Israel relationship, but could help change the USA's global image. 
7. 💥 The decision may also distance her from President Joe Biden's pro-Israel stance, moderating criticism from progressive Democrats. 
8. 🔜 More Democrats are expected to avoid Netanyahu's address, his fourth to a joint session of US parliament. 
9. 👥 AFP reported attacks on American volunteers in Qusra, a village in occupied Palestine, by Israeli settlers.
