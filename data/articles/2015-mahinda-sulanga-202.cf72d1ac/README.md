*03:33 AM, Monday, November 10, 2025*

A group of Sri Lankan opposition parties -self-styled as the “joint Opposition – have  announced that they would be launching  a prolonged joint opposition   campaign  of protest against the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, (JVP)led National People’s Power(NPP) Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.  .

The main opposition parties involved in this exercise are the United National Party(UNP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP)  Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya(PHU). The Chief opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB)  and other opposition parties such as the  Sarvajana Balaya(SB)  and the Tamil Progressive Alliance(TPA) will not participate in the protest campaign.

The campaign would begin with a mass rally at Nugegoda on November 21st.  The Nugegoda rally  named as the “Mahaa Jana Handa” (great voice of the people) would be followed by a series of mass rallies in different parts of the country. The opposition would be highlighting issues of   misgovernance , corruption and  alleged suppression of opposition parties by the NPP government in their campaign.

The announced strategy and modus operandi of the opposition campaign has evoked a sense of déjà vu.  Comparisons are being drawn between  the envisaged “Mahaa Jana Handa” Nugegoda rally on 21 November  2025 and the ”Mahinda Sulanga”Nugegoda Rally of 18 February 2015. It is even being said that the “Mahinda Sulanga(Mahinda Wind)rally is the inspiration for the current opposition in launching the “Mahaa jana Handa”campaign.

It may be recalled that Mahinda Rajapaksa who had been president from 2005 November onwards was defeated by the  common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015  January presidential elections. The politically vanquished Mahinda fought back defiantly to regain lost ground. A political rally was held in Nugegoda  a month after the  Presidential election. The rally titled “Mahinda Sulanga”was well-attended.

Thereafter a series of “Mahinda Sulanga”meetings were held in different parts of the Island. These rallies mobilised mass support for  Mahinda and brought about a Rajapaksa renaissance in politics. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna was launched in November 2016. The SLPP won the majority of Local authorities in the Feb 2018 Local govt elections. The SLPP candidate Gotabaya  Rajapaksa won the  November 2019 presidential elections. The SLPP romped home the winner in the  August 2020 Parliamentary elections.

Since the venue of both the Mahinda Sulanga and Mahaa Jana Handa rallies is Nugegoda there is an “inaugural”similarity. Also the current joint opposition plans to follow up Nugegoda with more rallies elsewhere just as what had  happened after  the Mahinda Sulanga rally. However attempts to strike up  a parallel between both could turn out to be a superficial analogy.

The Mahinda Sulanga mass rally at Nugegoda in  February 2015 was a unique phenomenon. It was conceived and implemented  at a different time against the backdrop  of a peculiar political environment.

Many political observers who keep referring to  that rally in the present context seem to be unaware or ill-informed about what exactly happened a decade ago. It is in that context therefore that this column focuses -with the aid of earlier writings – on the Mahinda Sulanga rally at Nugegoda on 18th February 2015 and its impact.

Mahinda Rajapaksa erred grievously in calling for premature Presidential elections in January 2015 in a bid to be elected President for a third term. He suffered bitter defeat at the hands of the SLFP general secretary turned common opposition presidential candidate Maithripala Sirisena.

Mahinda Rajapaksa was in a beleaguered state after facing defeat on the night of January 8th 2015.Bleak prospects were in store for him in a post –defeat situation. These ranged from legal action for alleged offences in domestic tribunals to punitive censure in International fora. There were however three  silver linings in the dark cloud of defeat that was threatening to envelope him.

Firstly the victorious Maithripala Sirisena had failed to win the numerical majority of the ethnic majority. It was estimated that 55% of votes cast by members of the Sinhala community had been in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa. On the other hand estimates said 81% of voters from the three ethnic minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils had polled for Maithripala Sirisena.

This had helped offset the disadvantage suffered by Sirisena in the Sinhala constituencies  and entitled him to overall victory. Though the final result had favoured Sirisena , he was unable to win over the majority of the Sinhalese. Since the Sinhalese comprise 74 % of the total population and Rajapaksa had won over half of the “Sinhala” votes, Medamulana Mahinda  therefore could not be easily written off politically.Even though some  applied  a racist veneer to this support, it was indeed a strong point in Mahinda’s favour and granted  him considerable political clout despite his defeat.

Secondly the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and its premier constituent the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had been firmly opposed to the ultimate victor Maithripala Sirisena. Individuals and parties from the SLFP and UPFA may have thrown in their lot with Sirisena at the hustings but the SLFP and the SLFP led UPFA were organizationally intact and firmly behind Mahinda Rajapaksa.

It was anticipated earlier that the “Vaasi Pathata Hoiya” syndrome would prevail after the Sirisena victory and that Parliamentarians would desert the SLFP/UPFA in large numbers. Several MP’s did cross, but the bulk of MP’s did not. The expected large scale desertion did not happen mainly because the election result had demonstrated that the majority of Sinhala voter support was still with Mahinda. Thus most MP’s opted to stay put with Mahinda rather than hitch their wagon to the Maithripala star.

Thirdly and perhaps most importantly the results of the Presidential election was not accurately reflected  in the then  Parliament.It was a minority government that was in power under Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The chief opposition United National Party (UNP) was ensconced in power as the government while the SLFP which still retained the bulk of seats in Parliament was in the opposition. Parliament was entitled to continue till 2016 April.This was a unique situation where the ruling regime was in actuality a lame duck government.

Mahinda Rajapaksa was obviously angry about the  bulk of Tamil and Muslim voters  rejecting him at the polls.He used it to his advantage by going public with the charge that the minorities had defeated him. More spice was added by saying that the  pro-tiger Tamil Diaspora had conspired against him.Thereafter  many SLFP and UPFA stalwearts  spread the story that the hero who won the war and prevented the country from splitting had been penalized by the minorities at the elections. This anti-minority card was played effectively by Mahinda and his political minions.

Despite his defeat,Mahinda was at that time the single most popular mass figure among Sinhala political leaders . In spite of this advantage,Mahinda did not  directly engage in confrontational  politics .Mahinda ceded the leadership of the SLFP to Maithripala without resistance and seemingly embarked upon a life of political retirement and religious contemplation.  He withdrew to his residences in Medamulana and Tangalle.Mahinda also visited places of Buddhist worship.It was very necessary  then for the defeated ex-president to project an image of being disinterested in political office and politics. It was as if he wanted to retire from politics.

While this optical exercise was maintained at one level , a different initiative was launched  on another level to mobilise public opinion in support of a Rajapaksa re-entry into politics.  However it was important that Rajapaksa should not be perceived as hankering after political office so soon after the Presidential debacle. He had to be seen as a retired statesman being re –drawn into politics reluctantly due to popular demand.

This was initially done by arranging for people from all parts of the country to visit the “Lion of the Ruhunu” in his traditional dens at Medamulana and Tangalle. The trips were subsidized and free but the people concerned made the choice freely to avail themselves of an opportunity to  cross the Bentara  river and travel down south and return home. No one was forced to make the trip. People decided for themselves.

What must not be lost sight of is the fact that most people who did undertake such “pilgrimages” to see their fallen hero were from the lower economic strata in rural areas. Even the election results showed that Mahinda retained much support within this segment of Sri Lankan society. The feelings displayed by these rural sections visiting Mahinda were rustically genuine in contrast to the sophisticated hypocrisy of the urban upper classes.When the visitors returned home the feedback generated was positively in favour of “Apey Mahinda”.

While these regular visits certainly boosted Mahinda’s sagging morale they did not serve him well in a larger political sense. Busloads of people journeying to “kurakkan country” to visit their ex – president was not enough to capture the national imagination or iinternational attention. Excursions to Hambantota are of little consequence in the broader canvas that is Sri Lanka. Hence there was a need for a broader strategy.

Since the reins of the SLFP were no more in the hands of Rajapaksa “officially”, the elements favourable to Mahinda within the United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA) were activated. The Pro-  Mahinda movement was launched without the overt involvement of the SLFP.

Four trusted captains from constituent parties in the UPFA were entrusted the task of launching and promoting a “Bring Back Mahinda” movement. They were Dinesh Gunewardena (MEP), Vasudeva Nanayakkara(NSSP), Wimal Weerawansa(NFF) and Udaya Gammanpila (then in JHU). This quartet  of three parliamentarians and one provincial councillor were the prime movers and shakers who organized the first “Bring Back Mahinda” rally at Nugegoda.

The Nugegoda Rally demanding the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to politics was the opening gambit in a planned series of political chess moves by the “bring back Mahinda” movement. It was a pioneering political experiment!The organizers had carefully selected the location.

They did not dare to hold it within Colombo city regarded  in those days as the citadel of the United National Party(UNP)and chose to stage it elsewhere but within Colombo district for demonstration effect.The venue was on the outskirts of Colombo in proximity to the Colombo district Sinhala majority electoral divisions of Maharagama, Kotte, Homagama and Kottawa where there was greater support for Mahinda Rajapaksa as opposed to the multi – ethnic Colombo city electoral divisions.

What was sought to be accomplished by the Nugegoda rally was a two – fold test. The first objective was to gauge the public mood and see whether the ground conditions were suitable to begin sowing the seeds of the campaign demanding Mahinda’s re-entry into active politics. The second was to assess the political pulse of President Sirisena in his new transfiguration as Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) leader and see how he responded to the challenge posed.

In keeping with the Indo – Sri Lankan practice of “Contrived crowds” where crowds for meetings are brought by organizers, bus loads of supporters were transported to the venue to make up a large crowd at the Nugegoda rally. Since the meeting was the first of its kind after Mahinda’s political defeat on January 8th, the organizers could not rely upon people attending on their own volition alone.

A poor crowd at the preliminary rally would have been a political disaster.So thousands of people were brought to the venue. But what exhilarated the Mahinda movement organizers was the unexpectedly large voluntary turn out. The “contrived” crowd was outnumbered by the people who came on their own. The organizers exaggerated the numbers as being in the range of six figures. That was not so! The attendance was in five digits.This by itself was quite impressive and sufficient to cause shock waves in the anti – Mahinda camp.

Like evangelical rallies where there is whipped up devotional fervour , there was much orchestrated frenzy at the Mahinda movement rally too. Mahinda himself did not make an appearance but his message was read out to the nation  with gusto by academic cum ex-diplomat Dayan Jayatilleka .

Rajapaksa Renaissance

The Nugegoda rally succeeded in “ shocking and awing “ the nation. By a well executed demonstration at Nugegoda Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to prove that he was not a spent force and that he was a force to be reckoned with yet.  It was the harbinger  of a Rajapaksa renaissance in politics. The downside to this was the overt and covert anti-minority campaign conducted. The appeal was to the Sinhala majority alone. As a result the majority of Tamil and Muslim voters were not supportive of the Rajapaksas.

As stated earlier the twin objectives of the Mahinda Sulanga Nugegoda rally were to gauge and demonstrate the political popularity of Mahinda Rajapaksa on the one hand and pose a defiant political challenge to the authority  of the  new President and new SLFP leader Maithripala Sirisena on the other. It was in a sense  a test to see how Sirisena conducted himself under pressure.

The Nugegoda rally was a success from the point of view of the organizers. A very large crowd both contrived and voluntary had converged at the venue. More importantly a large number of SLFP parliamentarians , provincial councillors and local authority representatives attended the event without mounting the stage.

Acid Test for Maithripala

The defiance displayed by these MP’s and councillors from the SLFP was a direct affront to the new party leader Maithripala. This was the acid test for the president. How would he react?Would he sting like a bee and show who the boss was?

President Sirisena did not sting like a bee! If at all he did sting, it was like a butterfly. Empty warnings and feeble threats were issued. None of which were taken seriously. No punitive action followed. Sirisena was perceived as a weak leader. The Mahinda movement tasted blood. A series of mass rallies followed at regular intervals in places like Kandy, Ratnapura, Matara, Kurunegala etc.

The participation of SLFP parliamentarians and councillors increased in numbers. Some even took to the stage. \some months later  the “iron butterfly” Hirunika Premachandra was to observe that had President Sirisena cracked down hard on SLFP elements in the aftermath of the Nugegoda rally, the other rallies may not have occurred.

That however did not happen as President Sirisena was found wanting. Instead of fizzling out the “Bring back Mahinda” movement continued to dazzle. Ultimately the Bring Back  Mahinda movement achieved its goal of bringing back Mahinda to “Temple Trees”!

Govt in Dominant Position

Apart from the similarity of venue, the Nugegoda rallies of Mahinda Sulanga and Mahaa Jana Handa are  totally different. The JVP/NPP govt seems to be in a dominant position vis a vis the opposition. President AKD is currently the single most popular mass figure in Sri Lankan politics. There is no one of equal stature among opposition leaders.

The NPP  popularity may have eroded at the local authority elections but the fact remains that the Compass won the bulk of seats at the polls as opposed to the opposition. The Govt  has not lost much support in the country. Though rumblings of discontent are discernible, there is no massive roar of protest  by the people at large against the government.  The AKD Govt’s anti-corruption  drive and anti-narcotics campaign have earned it much kudos among the people.

The issues likely to be raised by the opposition parties are of little consequence at present to the public. Furthermore there are many who feel that the opposition  politicians are panicking due to the fear of being penalised through the anti-corruption campaign conducted by the Govt.

Moreover despite some internal tension, there is overall unity within Govt ranks. As such there is very little chance of the opposition promoting dissension within the Government at the present time. In contrast there is  much disparity among and within the opposition.  There is a lot of suspicion that Namal Rajapaksa and the SLPP are attempting to hijack the rally as a promotional stunt for  Namal’s 2029 presidential candidacy.

The chief opposition party led by the accredited leader of the opposition keeps aloof from the protest campaign. It is like the Ramayana being staged without Lord Rama.Moreover President Dissanayake complimented Opposition Leader Premadasa in Parliament  for keeping away from Nugegoda. It appears that in typical fashion,Sajith is insecure about Ranil Wickremesinghe and Namal Rajapakse.

Against this backdrop  the prospects of the Nugegoda rally being a joint opposition sucees that could lay the foundation for greater opposition unity seems a remote possibility.Furthermore the fragile semblance of unity among opposition parties  currently visible is likely to shatter if and when provincial council elections are held.

It is clear therefore that the “Mahinda Sulanga”  Nugegoda Rally  and the proposed  “Mahaa Jana Handa”Nugegoda rally are vastly different. The political ecosystem in which the former was held does not apply to the latter.  It is premature at this juncture  to assess   whether the envisaged  February 21st Rally at Nugegoda would be  a success or not. Time will only tell!
