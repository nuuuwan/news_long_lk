The adoption of Buddhist meditation techniques, such as mindfulness, has become a lucrative industry in the USA and has been used for a variety of purposes, including dealing with stress and depression and increasing productivity. However, without grounding in the true foundations of Buddhist teaching, these practices can also cause confusion, disappointment and even psychosis. Although many meditating colleagues and practitioners may question the wisdom of following these practices without a clear understanding of their source, the author suggests that this is simply a modern adaptation of Buddhaâ€™s intent to eliminate doubts and mysticism from traditional life explanations. Arguably, these practices are being used in much the same way as Buddha himself used parables, similes, and stories to convey his teachings.
