    "MIT Technology Review\u2019s What\u2019s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them\u00a0here. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 is one of the world\u2019s safest, most productive rockets. But now it\u2019s been grounded: A rare engine malfunction on July 11 prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to initiate an investigation and halt all Falcon 9 flights until further notice. The incident has exposed the risks of the US aerospace industry\u2019s heavy reliance on the rocket.\u00a0  \u201cThe aerospace industry is very dependent on the Falcon 9,\u201d says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who issues regular reports on space launches. He says the Falcon 9 and the closely related Falcon Heavy represented 83% of US launches in 2023. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of traffic that\u2019s going to be backed up waiting for it to return to flight,\u201d he adds. During a SpaceX livestream, ice could be seen accumulating on the Falcon 9\u2019s engine following its launch from California\u2019s Vandenberg Space Force Base en route to releasing 20 Starlink satellites. According to SpaceX, this buildup of ice caused a liquid oxygen leak. Then part of the engine failed, and the rocket dropped several satellites into a lower orbit than intended, one in which they could readily fall back into Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
    "By July 12, an FAA press statement was circulating on X. The federal agency said it was aware of the malfunction and would require an investigation. \u201cA return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,\u201d said the statement. SpaceX says it will cooperate with the investigation. \u201cSpaceX will perform a full investigation in coordination with the FAA, determine root cause, and make corrective actions to ensure the success of future missions,\u201d says a statement on the company\u2019s website. Details about what the investigation will entail and how long it might take are unknown. In the meantime, SpaceX has requested to keep flying the Falcon 9 while the investigation takes place. \u201cThe FAA is reviewing the request and will be guided by safety at every step of the process,\u201d said the agency in a statement.",
    "Nominal failure The Falcon 9 has an unusually clean safety record. It\u2019s been launched more than 300 times since its maiden voyage in 2010 and has rarely failed. In 2020, the rocket was the first to launch under NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, which was designed to build the US\u2019s commercial capacity for taking people, including astronauts, into orbit.\u00a0 Related StoryMusic streaming can be a drag on the environment.

    "According to MIT aerospace engineer Paulo Lozano, part of the Falcon 9\u2019s success is due to advances in rocket engines. Exactly how SpaceX incorporates these new technologies is unclear, and Lozano notes that SpaceX is quite secretive about the manufacturing process. But it is known that SpaceX uses additive manufacturing to build some engine components. This makes it possible to create parts with complex geometries (for example, hollow\u2014and thus lighter-weight\u2014turbine blades) that enhance performance. And, according to Lozano, artificial intelligence has made diagnosing engine health faster and more accurate. Parts of the rocket are also reusable, which keeps costs low.\u00a0\u00a0 With such a successful track record, the Falcon 9 malfunction might seem surprising. But, Lozano says, anomalies are to be expected when it comes to rocket engines. That\u2019s because they operate in harsh environments where they\u2019re subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures. This makes it difficult for engineers to manufacture a rocket as reliable as a commercial airplane. \u201cThese engines produce more power than small cities, and they work in stressful conditions,\u201d says Lozano. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to contain them.\u201d\u00a0 What exactly went wrong last week remains a mystery. Still, experts agree the event can\u2019t be brushed off. \u201c\u2018Oh, it was a fluke\u2019 is not, in the modern space industry, an acceptable answer,\u201d says McDowell. What he finds most surprising is that the malfunction didn\u2019t occur in one of the reusable parts of the rocket (like the booster), but instead in a part known as the second stage, which SpaceX switches out each time the rocket launches.\u00a0 Stalled schedules It remains unclear when the Falcon 9 will fly again. Several upcoming missions will likely be postponed, including the billionaire tech entrepreneur Jacob Isaacman\u2019s Polaris Dawn, which would have been the first all-private mission to include a space walk. It\u2019s possible NASA\u2019s SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), planned for mid-August 2024, will also be delayed.\u00a0 Uncrewed missions will be affected too. One that stands out is the Europa Clipper mission, which is intended to explore Jupiter\u2019s icy moon and assess its habitability. According to McDowell, the mission, which is planned for October 2024, will likely be delayed by the Falcon 9 grounding. That\u2019s because there is a narrow time frame within which the satellite can be launched. (The mission is facing a technological hangup unrelated to the Falcon 9 that could also push back its launch.)\u00a0 The incident reveals a need for the US to explore alternatives to the Falcon 9. McDowell says the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas V rocket, accompanied by Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule, used to be the next best option for US-based crewed ISS missions. But the Atlas V is being phased out. It will be replaced by the ULA\u2019s Vulcan Centaur, a partially reusable rocket that has made only one test flight so far. Plus, the Starliner capsule has serious issues that have left two NASA astronauts stuck at the ISS, potentially until August.\u00a0 Blue Origin\u2019s reusable New Glenn rocket could be a competitor, but it hasn\u2019t flown yet. The aerospace company says it hopes to launch the rocket before 2025. Blue Origin\u2019s other reusable rocket, New Shepard, is not capable of flying into orbit.\u00a0 The Falcon 9 malfunction makes these projects all the more essential. \u201cEven the Falcon 9 can have problems,\u201d says McDowell. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have multiple routes of access to space.\u201d\u00a0 hide"
