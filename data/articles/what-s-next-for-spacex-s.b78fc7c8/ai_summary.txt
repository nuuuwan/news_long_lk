1. 🚀 SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has been grounded due to a rare engine malfunction on July 11.
2. 🇺🇸 The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated an investigation and halted all Falcon 9 flights until further notice.
3. 🚦 The grounding reveals the risky dependency of the US aerospace industry on the Falcon 9, which represented 83% of US launches in 2023.
4. ❄️ A SpaceX livestream showed ice accumulating on the Falcon 9's engine during launch, leading to a liquid oxygen leak and causing the rocket to deviate from its intended orbit.
5. 🕵️‍♂️ While details of the investigation are unknown, SpaceX is collaborating fully with the FAA and has requested to continue Falcon 9 flights during the investigation.
6. 🕹️ According to MIT's Paulo Lozano, the past success of Falcon 9 is partly due to advances in rocket engines and the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosing engine health.
7. ⏱️ This grounding could delay numerous upcoming missions, including Elon Musk's private space mission - Polaris Dawn and possibly NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS).
8. 🌛 Uncrewed missions such as the Europa Clipper mission, scheduled to explore Jupiter's icy moon, are also likely to be postponed. 
9. 🚀 The United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket, a potential alternative to the Falcon 9, is being phased out and replaced with the partially reusable Vulcan Centaur, which has only made one test flight. 
10. 📅 Blue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, another competitor, has not yet flown, but the company hopes to launch it before 2025.
