No political leader has been subjected to vilification and character assassination like RW in the history of this country

Two years ago, Sri Lanka was in a complete state of anarchy. The nation was undergoing its worst economic and political crisis in its contemporary history. People died while they were languishing in long queues to buy fuel, powdered milk, gas cylinders, and various other essentials. Schools and universities were not functioning, and the future of the youth and children appeared bleak. The first half of 2022 was one of the most unfortunate periods in the history of the island, characterised by despair, grief, and severe turmoil, which nobody in the country even wants to recall.

Thankfully, two years later, a sense of optimism and tranquillity prevails across the country. Hours-long power cuts have ended. The acute shortage of essentials has disappeared. Schools and universities are functioning as usual, and normalcy and order have been restored. Following the unprecedented and most severe economic crisis in Sri Lanka‚Äôs post-independence history, a gradual economic revival can be observed due to the prudent and timely policy adjustments implemented by the Government. The economy has expanded for three consecutive quarters since the third quarter of 2023, following contractions for six quarters in a row.

Considerable progress has been made in terms of external debt restructuring, which could be could be considered as an impressive milestone. A provisional pact has been entered into with a selected group of bondholders in terms of restructuring about $ 12.5 billion ISBs owed by the State. Final agreements have also been concluded on rearranging $ 10 billion debt owed to major bilateral lenders.

The decisive political leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) during this period of revival needs to be admired as he demonstrated his astuteness by taking unpopular decisions without considering the political ramifications. The veteran political leader took the helm probably at the most difficult time in Sri Lanka‚Äôs post-independent history and he had to walk a tightrope, characterised by having to manage conflicting domestic and geopolitical challenges, like Grusha in the celebrated German play Caucasian Chalk Circle who rescued the abandoned child Michael by crossing over a dangerous vine bridge despite tremendous obstacles. When he took over the country, Sri Lanka‚Äôs usable foreign reserves had declined to less than $ 50 million in mid-2022, precipitating a harrowing time for the populace.

No praise only brickbats

No political leader has been subjected to vilification and character assassination like RW in the history of this country. The mainstream print media is dominated by columnists who are viscerally opposed to UNP Leader. They expend their energy and time to misrepresent his policies and legacy while unfairly slandering his image. RW comes from a privileged family background. Even his detractors admit that he is not a politician who has amassed wealth through politics. He is the only local university graduate to attain the position of either Prime Minister or President in the history of Sri Lanka. Countless individuals in this country, who cannot match the stature and accomplishments of the President, malign and defame him as they despise his class, academic accomplishments, international relations, and other achievements.

Twenty-three years ago, when our economy had suffered a negative growth rate for the first time in its post-independent history, it was RW who took the leadership of the country after his party had won the 2001 General Election. Four months before his victory, Lloyds of London had declared Sri Lanka as a war-risk zone; hence, ships were reluctant to enter Sri Lanka. Hours-long power cuts were the order of the day. The period from 94-2001 witnessed debilitating military setbacks and places of national importance such as oil storage complexes in Kolonnawa, the Central Bank, World Trade Centre, BIA, etc., came under deadly attack from the LTTE.

Despite this adverse background, at the end of his two-year government in 2004, RW was able to bring about a state of normalcy and stability to the country. The economic growth rate rose to 6% in 2003, and the peace process he initiated ensured the safety of citizens. He laid the groundwork for the economy to take off by developing a comprehensive strategic programme for economic development ‚Äì Regaining Sri Lanka. The Regaining Sri Lanka addressed the fundamental structural issues of the economy and if the reforms proposed by that blueprint had been implemented, our economy would not have suffered the crisis it underwent in 2022.

Legacy of progressiveness

Erroneously, ignorant Fidel Castro-loving columnists and various other pundits characterise RW as an adherent of Neoliberalism and his policies are portrayed as favouring a tiny minority of affluent individuals. The truth of the matter is his political career has always been an epitome of progressiveness and modernism. An in-depth observation would reveal that the President‚Äôs policies manifest the thinking of the Centrist-wing of the Democratic Party ‚Äì which was put into action by the administrations of the two previous Democratic Presidents ‚Äì Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Some could even say RW‚Äôs policies have a resemblance to the ideas enunciated by Rockefeller Republicanism.

One of the landmark initiatives under his presidency is the implementation of Urumaya programme which grants freehold deeds to farmers. RW attempted to grant freehold deeds to farmers when he was Premier during 2002 to 2004, but he was blocked by courts. Then again even under the Yahapalana administration, he tried to do the same, but his efforts were foiled by the regressive-minded Maithripala Sirisena who opposed the granting of freehold deeds to farmers. According to the political commentator Ajith Perakum Jayasinghe, the newly launched program goes beyond simply providing ownership rights. It aims to catalyse a shift from subsistence farming towards a more commercially focused agricultural sector, thereby fostering rural economic development and creating better livelihoods for farmers.

Some urbanites and Leftists criticise this move as they fear that farmers would sell their lands to multinational companies to earn a quick buck. Big firms are not keen on acquiring small, fragmented plots of land owned by individual farmers despite the false claims of groups who are opposed to market-based economic policies. For decades, people living in lands under licenses like Jaya Bhumi and Swarna Bhumi aspired for freehold deeds, but their dreams could only be realised when RW became Head of State.

Some of his detractors often cite RW‚Äôs lack of fatherhood to demean him. However, he has committed his entire career as a public administrator to develop a bright future for the youth and children of this country. RW is perceived as one of the best Education Ministers this country has ever had. The number of schools teaching science streams increased by 30%, and the schools with A-level classes grew by 60% when he was the Minister of Education. The National Colleges of Education that were launched by him in 1985 continue to be the most sought-after path for the youth who aspire to become teachers in government schools.

He established nine National Colleges of Education (e.g. Nilwala and Sariputhra) and two national education training centres during his stint as Education Minister. With the assurance of job safety and hostel facilities for students, this mechanism has served the education sector quite admirably for decades up to now. In order to resolve the acute shortage of English Language teachers in government schools, RW initiated the Delic System of English training.

Even after becoming President, he has not forgotten the well-being of school children. Through the President‚Äôs Fund, he has initiated a program to offer scholarships amounting to Rs. 6,000 per month for a period of 24 months to 5,000 deserving students who are pursuing A/L studies. He has also allocated Rs. 3,600 million from the President‚Äôs Fund to support 100,000 students from Grade 1 to Grade 11 who are facing financial difficulties.

A pioneer in modernisation

RW has a cherished legacy in terms of contributing towards the progress of Sri Lanka‚Äôs ICT industry. His acclaimed association with Sri Lanka‚Äôs ICT industry is described beautifully by Chanuka Wattegama, a noted ICT analyst in Sri Lanka, in the Daily Mirror newspaper on 23 July, 2019, in his column titled ‚Äì Presidential Election 2020: Who will craft our own digital future? ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Indian friends of mine still talk highly about Rajiv Gandhi as the pioneer of digital boom in India. Gandhi lost power in 1989 and was assassinated immediately prior to re-election ‚Äì i.e. before the IT boom in India took off. That also left P.V. Narasimha Rao to carry out liberalisation with Dr. Manmohan Singh on one side, Chidambaram on other. Still Gandhi was that passionate individual who started it all. In Sri Lanka, our own Rajiv Gandhi could be Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äù.

As Education Minister, RW introduced television sets with VCR players and computers to Sri Lankan schools, thereby initiating ICT Education in Sri Lankan schools. As Industries and Science and Technology Minister, RW was instrumental in connecting Sri Lanka to the international submarine cable SEA-ME-WE. Also, he launched the first INFOTEL ICT trade exhibition in 1993. Probably his significant achievement was playing a pivotal role in introducing the internet to Sri Lanka by laying the groundwork during his visit to the USA in 1993 where he met the US Vice President Al Gore.

As Prime Minister in 2002, he launched the e-Sri Lanka program ‚Äì an ambitious program to leapfrog Sri Lanka into the digital sphere and setup the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) as the implementation body, replacing the Council for Information Technology (CINTEC). During the same period, he also kicked off ‚ÄòSmartGov‚Äô, the first e-government initiative in Sri Lanka.

The President has an ambitious plan to transform Sri Lanka into a sustainable, digital society by leveraging advanced, technology-based solutions through the DIGIECON 2030 program. As part of the seven-year program (DIGIECON 2030), the Government intends to establish a Universal Digital Identity platform, streamline Government payments, and launch a digital nomad visa scheme in addition to a single-window approval process for the ICT sector.

Commitment to create a truly inclusive Sri Lanka

Since becoming President, the veteran politician has made a number of decisions to raise the self-esteem of minorities as well as enhance coexistence among communities. The UNP Leader‚Äôs decision to recommence singing the national anthem in Tamil on the Independence Day ceremony is representative of his genuine commitment towards creating a pluralistic and inclusive society. Recently, RW apologised to the nation for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration‚Äôs decision to impose forced cremations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ill-advised move caused immense emotional trauma, particularly to the Muslim community apart from clashing with the religious beliefs of Christians. He is perhaps the only Head of State/Government in our lifetimes to express regret over a policy implemented with the intention of discriminating a particular ethnic/religious community.

Imprudent political strategies hurt his political career

RW could have had a more impressive political career had the UNP not toppled the CBK-led PA Government in 2001. Although his two-year premiership stabilised the economy and the country at large, the ceasefire violations committed by the LTTE during this period provided the opportunity for his opponents to portray that he was appeasing the LTTE. As a result, he lost his votebase in the South and the UNP had to spend a decade in political wilderness. The empirical evidence shows that gaining a parliamentary majority when the executive presidency is held by a rival political party is simply committing political suicide. The same mistake was again committed by the UNP in 2015 when it backed the SLFPer Maithripala Sirisena for presidency in 2015.

The need to have an astute and matured leader in challenging times

Today, we live in a complex world with a multiplicity of challenges. Given Sri Lanka‚Äôs location, the nation has to encounter various trials stemming from regional rivalries and conflicts between the global superpowers. The formation of QUAD and the rising influence of China in the Indian Ocean have given rise to a convoluted environment in Asia.

The South Asian Island is regularly subject to the power games played between China and India. The recent victory of the Labour Party at the British Parliamentary Election on an anti-Sri Lanka platform is another foreign policy headache to the country. Such complex geopolitical and international challenges necessitate having a leader who can grasp complex global realities and address them successfully in the calibre of Ranil Wickremesinghe, a highly educated and well-read individual with a cosmopolitan outlook, who is at complete ease with diplomacy and international affairs.

Our nation has stagnated far too long. We need to move forward, and our children deserve a better future. This is no time for a novice. All of us went through the torment of having been governed by an apprentice for two-and-half years. None of us want to go through the same ordeal again. Thus, we must rally behind a leader who has the maturity and astuteness to take our nation forward and manage the intricate challenges that arise both locally and internationally without carrying out risky experimentations that could be detrimental towards our future generations.
