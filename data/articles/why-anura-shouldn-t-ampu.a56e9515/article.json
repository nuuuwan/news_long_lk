    "President AKD: Facile optimism on debt, economy, stability",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dropped into Parliament during the Defence Ministry vote and delivered a cluster of crucial pronouncements which included deep cuts in the military, exultation over IMF endorsement, and derisive dismissal of possible crisis, collapse or uprising.",
    "\u2018\u2026He said the military forces will be downsized by 2030. Sri Lanka Army personnel will be reduced to 100,000, Sri Lanka Navy reduced by 40,000 and Sri Lanka Air Force personnel will be reduced by 18,000.",
    "\u2026However, he assures that while troop numbers would decrease, military capability would be strengthened through advanced technology and modernised equipment.",
    "\u201cThe Air Force\u2019s fighter jets, helicopters and weapons are nearing expiration,\u201d he revealed.",
    "The President noted that provisions have been made for acquiring new aircraft for the Air Force and warships for the Navy, alongside a Rs. 1,000 million allocation to improve Police facilities.",
    "He said to boost security, the Cabinet of Ministers already approved recruiting 10,000 new Police officers and an additional 4,000 Air Force personnel.",
    "(https://www.ft.lk/top-story/President-AKD-vows-civilised-Sri-Lanka-professional-armed-forces/26-773636)",
    "President AKD has adopted not only the neoliberal economics of Ranil Wickremesinghe but also his cosmopolitan-liberal agenda of \u2018security sector reform\u2019 targeting the Army. That had been propagated by Western-funded think-tanks such as the Berghof Foundation and pursued by Ranil from his 2001 Prime Ministership and Ceasefire Agreement with Prabhakaran.",
    "The Politics column of our sister Sunday paper identified and contextualized AKD\u2019s inspiration:",
    "\u201c\u2026This is in the backdrop of Western governments urging Sri Lanka to downsize the military and thus prune defence expenditure. During the previous administration, a goal was set to bring the military strength to 100,000\u2026\u201d",
    "(https://www.sundaytimes.lk/250302/columns/all-out-war-to-hunt-down-military-deserters-turned-underworld-elements-589492.html)",
    "The expenditure on the Army is mainly in rupees\u2014we weren\u2019t planning to acquire Abrams tanks. However, new aircraft and warships cost dollars. So, what\u2019s Anura\u2019s logic in slashing the military numbers while buying new planes and ships for the Air Force and Navy, notwithstanding heavy dollar repayments on our foreign debt?",
    "If AKD goes ahead, he will also be giving the criminal underworld an army of its own, or rather, giving each gang, mini-armies of their own or creating new gangs. The resultant criminal civil wars will prove uncontrollable by a downsized Army stretched thin.",
    "Severing the lion\u2019s paw",
    "AKD\u2019s decision is a dangerously irresponsible strategic blunder. The Sri Lankan state exists primarily to protect the country\u2019s national sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and security. A small country on the doorstep of a large neighbour cannot rely on an Air Force and Navy as deterrents, because the larger, richer country can swat them like flies.",
    "In such a geopolitical setting, world history offers only one strategic solution instead of surrender: construct the capacity for protracted asymmetric warfare as deterrent or defensive strategy. Protracted asymmetric warfare \u2013 let\u2019s call it PAW, like \u2018the lion\u2019s paw\u2019-- cannot depend primarily on planes or warships. It must rest on the credible capacity to inflict an unacceptable level of casualties over time on an invading/occupying force. The chief instrument of such a strategy is a trained military which can devolve into smaller fighting units and wage asymmetric irregular warfare, capitalizing on the superior morale and motivation of fighting for your nation on your own territory, and the advantage of having one\u2019s citizenry as source of recruitment and protective rear-base.",
    "The sheer survival as a fighting force of Hamas, with no safe rear-base, in the face of the most intensive unleashing of firepower in a bounded space the world has seen since WWII, brings home that there is no substitute for trained, motivated, infantry; a fighting force on the ground (and under it).",
    "Sri Lanka needs a sizeable military. It has to be taught, trained and equipped better for deterrence and if that fails, national defence and resistance until liberation or a negotiated withdrawal of external forces.",
    "The current dangerously anarchic moment in world history is not the time to slash the Army by 1/3rd to 100,000 men in a mere five years. It is also unwise to slash the Navy by 40,000 and the Air Force by 18,000. The crucial battle of the Kilali lagoon which blocked the LTTE\u2019s post-Elephant Pass Jaffna thrust in 2000, was fought by a joint force of the Army and Navy.",
    "AKD\u2019s declaration on military shrinkage must be read together with Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath\u2019s recent statement in Geneva.",
    "\u2018\u2026Minister Herath further stated that the contours of a Truth and Reconciliation framework, will be further discussed with the broadest possible cross section of stakeholders\u2026\u2019",
    "(https://www.ft.lk/news/SL-at-Human-Rights-Council-reaffirms-commitment-to-protect-and-safeguard-rights-of-all/56-773577)",
    "Vijitha Herath\u2019s speech reveals that the AKD administration has borrowed from Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Like Gotabaya, the JVP-NPP wants to dump the 13th amendment and doesn\u2019t wish to promise elections to the Provincial Councils. Instead, it has converted to Ranil-Mangala formula on wartime accountability: Office of the Independent Prosecutor, Truth and Reconciliation framework etc.",
    "A Truth and Reconciliation framework belongs to:",
    "(a)The experience of South Africa\u2019s transition from minority apartheid rule to majority democratic rule.",
    "(b)Latin America\u2019s transition from military dictatorships to democracy.",
    "(c)Negotiated conclusions to unwinnable civil wars.",
    "Sri Lanka belongs to a very different category. It is a multiparty democratic state with elected civilian governments that fought two civil wars, South and North, and won both conclusively. \u2018Transitional justice\u2019 methodology is irrelevant when there is no such transition. The prosecution of emblematic individual cases as identified and recommended by the LLRC (2011) is necessary. A TRC framework, by contrast, can be dangerously polarizing.",
    "Meanwhile Mohamed Ali Sabry, PC, unelected President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s Foreign Minister, has called for a Sri Lankan foreign policy that is both \u2018Nonaligned and Multi-aligned\u2019. That formula is both oxymoronic and moronic. Sri Lanka needs a foreign policy that is \u2018Nonaligned and Multidirectional\u2019 (or to borrow from Russia\u2019s iconic Foreign Minister, the late Academician Evgeny Primakov, \u2018Multi-Vector\u2019).",
    "Anura Dissanayake or Fidel Castro?",
    "Is President AKD right in his overweening optimism about the economy and stability? The answer depends on whose thinking we trust: that of Anura Dissanayake or Fidel Castro?",
    "Latin America fought for and won its Independence and constituted states 200 years before Asia and Africa. Thus, it faced problems, underwent processes and experienced phenomena that we do now, considerably before we did. The debt crisis hit Latin America in the 1980s, and no world leader then or later, studied the dimensions and dynamics of the foreign debt issue as did Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro. Nobel Prize winner for literature Gabriel Garcia Marquez describes Fidel\u2019s engagement:",
    "\u201c\u2026The subject of Latin America\u2019s foreign debt had arisen in his conversations for the first time two years before, and had been developing, branching out, growing more profound, until it became something very much like a recurring nightmare\u2026 During three trips I made to Havana that year, I pieced together his latest variations on the theme: the repercussions of the debt on the countries\u2019 economies, its political and social impact, its decisive influence on international relations, its providential importance for a united Latin American policy\u2026 He convoked a major congress of experts in Havana and gave a speech in which he left out none of the salient questions... By then he had a comprehensive vision which the simple passage of time has borne out\u2026\u201d",

Do not waste your time,\u201d he said\u2026He also added that Sri Lanka\u2019s economy was stabilising with the IMF expected to approve the third review of its bailout program soon. \u201cWe are expecting a favourable outcome from the review,\u201d he said\u2026\u2019",

    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s debt service in 2025 is estimated at US $ 2,454 million made up of US $ 1,369 million in capital repayments and US $ 1,085 million in interest, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha has said.",

    "\u2026The first thing the IMF demands is a reduction in the rate of inflation, a reduction in the budgetary deficit and restrictive measures of a social nature that increase unemployment and aggravate the problems that have been accumulating and multiplying for long years.",
    "\u2026What restrictions would they have to apply in order to pay that fabulous amount of interest, plus reduce inflation and promote development? \u2026It is a practically impossible task.",
    "\u2026 The problem resides in the enormous amounts of interest that must be paid each year, religiously and punctually; exaggerated, unrealistic goals related to inflation; the reduction of the budgetary deficit; the limitation of social expenditures in countries riddled with problems in education, health care, nutrition, housing, unemployment, etc.; and other measures demanded by the IMF which become impossible to apply when the country is forced to make enormous disbursements simply to pay the unfair interest on its debt.\u201d",

    "\u2026An impossible rate of economic growth would be needed, with an impossible growth in exports, to obtain the resources needed to pay the debt. And even if all that is achieved, based on the best variants, far from being reduced, the debt will continue to grow.\u201d",

    "\u201cThe banks ran after the governments, trying to lend them money; There were big commissions and very high interest rates. Much of that money was misspent; much of it fled back to its country of origin; much of it was misappropriated. Very bad use was made of it.\u201d",

    "Hubristic about the political stability of his Government, AKD is scornfully dismissive about the Opposition inside and outside Parliament.",
    "\u2018\u2026The President dismissed speculation that his Government could be toppled through economic or political crises, asserting that traditional tactics used to overthrow past Governments will not work under his leadership\u2026He said street protests, another historical method of regime change would also fail, as the public no longer supports political destabilisation.\u2019",
