Navigating unsolicited ideas, advice, or suggestions at work is a common scenario. Consider the colleague who jumps in with a barrage of “Have you considered…?” or “What about…?” questions during your carefully crafted presentation. Or how about when you request specific information and the responses you get back include unsolicited advice on aspects of your work you didn’t ask about? In this article, the author offers four strategies for how to set boundaries around unsolicited input with tact, respect, and assertiveness.

“Does it look like I have the words ‘suggestion box’ plastered on my forehead?” Dana* griped to me in our coaching session. Her colleague Ethan had yet again offered unsolicited input on her new business development initiative. As soon as she laid out her proposal, Ethan burst in with, “Have you considered an email marketing campaign?” and “This is definitely something you should partner with sales on!” Over time, his well-intentioned enthusiasm began to frustrate Dana. She hesitated to share her ideas with Ethan, guarding against unprompted input that often left her feeling undermined, not supported.
