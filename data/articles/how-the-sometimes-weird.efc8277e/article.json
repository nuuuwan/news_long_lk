    "For the last couple of years, I\u2019ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity\u2019s \u201ccore problem.\u201d Put simply, they say death is wrong\u2014for everyone. They\u2019ve even said it\u2019s morally wrong. They established what they consider a new philosophy, and\u00a0they called it Vitalism. Related StoryMeet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is \u201cwrong\u201dRead next Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though\u2014it\u2019s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they\u2019re starting to make progress.",
    "Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng\u2014two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience\u2014you can read more about it\u00a0here.) Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I\u2019ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.",
    "It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies. The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I\u2019ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I\u2019ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the\u00a0cryopreservation\u2014and subsequent reanimation\u2014of a man and the multiple wives he\u2019s had throughout his life. I\u2019ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life. Related StoryThe quest to legitimize longevity medicineRead next I\u2019ve seen people\u00a0draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I\u2019ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their\u00a0plans to inject men\u2019s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve \u201cradical longevity.\u201d I\u2019ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I\u2019ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It\u2019s been a ride. My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers.\u00a0Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there\u2019s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever. At the same time, powerful people who influence\u00a0state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter\u00a0Jim O\u2019Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump\u2019s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. \u201cIt seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,\u201d Gries told me. I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, funds \u201cbreakthrough\u201d biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led\u00a0Evernow, a company focused on \u201chealth and longevity for every woman.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?\u201d she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had \u201cincredible support\u201d from \u201cthe very top of HHS.\u201d I asked if she was referring to Jim O\u2019Neill. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t go into the specifics.",
    "Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough. And that\u2019s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.
