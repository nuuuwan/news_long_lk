    "For many years, researchers have been working to build devices that can mimic photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants use sunlight and carbon dioxide to make their fuel. These artificial leaves use sunlight to separate water into oxygen and hydrogen, which could then be used to fuel cars or generate electricity. Now a research team has taken aim at creating more energy-dense fuels. Companies have been manufacturing synthetic fuels for nearly a century by combining carbon monoxide (which can be sourced from carbon dioxide) and hydrogen under high temperatures. But the hope is that artificial leaves can eventually do a similar kind of synthesis in a more sustainable and efficient way, by tapping into the power of the sun.  The group\u2019s device produces ethylene and ethane, proving that artificial leaves can create hydrocarbons. The development could offer a cheaper, cleaner way to make fuels, chemicals, and plastics.\u00a0 For research lead Virgil Andrei at the University of Cambridge, the ultimate goal is to use this technology to create fuels that don\u2019t leave a harmful carbon footprint after they\u2019re burned. If the process uses carbon dioxide captured from the air or power plants, the resulting fuels could be carbon neutral\u2014and ease the need to keep digging up fossil fuels.",
    "\u201cEventually we want to be able to source carbon dioxide to produce the fuels and chemicals that we need for industry and for everyday lives,\u201d says Andrei, who coauthored a study published in Nature Catalysis in February. \u201cYou end up mimicking nature\u2019s own carbon cycle, so you don\u2019t need additional fossil resources.\u201d Copper nanoflowers Like other artificial leaves, the team\u2019s device harnesses energy from the sun to create chemical products. But producing hydrocarbons is more complicated than making hydrogen because the process requires more energy.",
    "To accomplish this feat, the researchers introduced a few innovations. The first was to use a specialized catalyst made up of tiny flower-like copper structures, produced in the lab of coauthor Peidong Yang at the University of California, Berkeley. On one side of the device, electrons accumulated on the surfaces of these nanoflowers. These electrons were then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into a range of molecules including ethylene and ethane, hydrocarbons that each contain two carbon atoms.\u00a0  Microscope images of the device\u2019s copper nanoflowers.ANDREI, V., ROH, I., LIN, JA. ET AL. / NAT CATAL (2025)   These nanoflower structures are tunable and could be adjusted to produce a wide range of molecules, says Andrei: \u201cDepending on the nanostructure of the copper catalyst you can get wildly different products.\u201d\u00a0 On the other side of the device, the team also developed a more energy-efficient way to source electrons by using light-absorbing silicon nanowires to process glycerol rather than water, which is more commonly used. An added benefit is that the glycerol-based process can produce useful compounds like glycerate, lactate, and acetate, which could be harvested for use in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.\u00a0 Scaling up Even though the trial system worked, the advance is only a stepping stone toward creating a commercially viable source of fuel. \u201cThis research shows this concept can work,\u201d says Yanwei Lum, a chemical and biomolecular engineering assistant professor at the National University of Singapore. But, he adds, \u201cthe performance is still not sufficient for practical applications. It\u2019s still not there yet.\u201d Andrei says the device needs to be significantly more durable and efficient in order to be adopted for fuel production. But the work is moving in the right direction.\u00a0 \u201cWe have been making this progress because we looked at more unconventional concepts and state-of-the-art techniques that were not really available,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic that this technology could take off in the next five to 10 years.\u201d  hide"
