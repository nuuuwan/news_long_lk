    "In the fall of 2024, a trucking company in Falls Township, Pennsylvania, temporarily stored a storm-damaged Tesla at its yard. A few weeks later, the car burst into flames that grew out of control within seconds, some shooting out 30 feet. A local fire company tried in vain to squelch the blaze, spraying more than 2,000 gallons of water on the vehicle. Eventually, the firefighters requested help from a fire company in neighboring Bristol Township, led by volunteer fire chief Howard McGoldrick. He\u2019d been fighting fires since 1989, but this conflagration was unusual: It was a chemical fire in a lithium-ion battery, meaning it provided its own heat, fuel, and oxygen. And it was incredibly challenging to extinguish.\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryThree frequently asked questions about EVs, answeredFrom chargers to hybrids, here's what you should know about the future of transportation.",
    "McGoldrick was encountering fires like this more and more often. The previous year, he says, several rowhouses were badly burned after overcharged lithium-ion batteries in racing drones ignited inside. In another nearby incident, old lithium-ion biomedical devices at a scrapyard got soaked in a rainstorm and combusted. The Tesla fire felt like a breaking point. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Okay, this is just too many incidents in a short amount of time,\u2019\u201d McGoldrick recalls. He went in search of someone who could help his company get better at responding to fires in lithium-ion batteries. He found Patrick Durham.",
    "Durham is the owner of (and mustache behind) StacheD Training, one of a growing number of private companies helping first responders learn how to deal with lithium-ion battery safety, including electric-vehicle fires. Although there isn\u2019t solid data on the frequency of EV battery fires, it\u2019s no secret to EV makers that these fires are happening. Yet the manufacturers offer no standardized steps on how to fight them or avoid them in the first place, leaving first responders scrambling to search through each car\u2019s emergency response guide\u2014something that\u2019s hard to do when you\u2019re standing in front of an immolating vehicle.",
    "In this void, Durham offers a wealth of resources to first responders, from easy-to-follow video tutorials to hours-long in-person workshops. In 2024 alone, Durham says he trained approximately 2,000 first responders around the country. As more people buy EVs, in part to help address climate change, the need for this training has only grown; in less than two years, Durham\u2019s YouTube channel has attracted almost 30,000 subscribers. (The US doesn\u2019t currently collect data on the frequency or causes of EV fires, but this year the US Fire Administration and the Fire Safety Research Institute are rolling out a new data collection system for fire departments.) A circumspect man with a shaved head, brown eyes, and a thick horseshoe mustache framing his mouth, Durham previously worked as a mechanical engineer developing battery boxes for EVs. He is also a volunteer firefighter, and in 2020 he offered his first training on fires in lithium-ion batteries to his local department. From there, his reputation spread by word of mouth. Today, StacheD Training is Durham\u2019s full-time work. He\u2019s also the captain of his local volunteer fire department in Troy, Michigan.\u00a0\u00a0 As more EVs hit the road, what worries Durham most isn\u2019t just the growing likelihood of battery fires\u2014it\u2019s their intensity. \u201cThe severity of the fire is significant compared to a regular vehicle fire,\u201d he says. \u201cThe traditional car fires that you and I grew up with\u2014the majority of those always start in the engine compartment,\u201d says Jim Stevenson, a fire chief from rural Michigan who has taken Durham\u2019s training. \u201cSo we basically get there, we pop the car hood, and then we put out the fire from there, and if it gets into the inner compartment of the car? Not a big deal. You spray it down with the hose, and it\u2019s out in no time.\u201d With EV fires, Stevenson says, \u201cit\u2019s just a completely different monster.\u201d\u00a0  SHAWN HAZEN   An EV battery is essentially a tightly packed array of thousands of cells, each of which ranges from approximately the size and shape of an AA battery to the size of a legal envelope, depending on the battery model. If a single cell gets damaged\u2013such as by getting crushed, overcharged, or waterlogged\u2013that cell can heat uncontrollably in a process called thermal runaway. It will release so much heat and flammable gas that it generates its own fire, which spreads to the other cells.\u00a0 Older lithium-ion battery packs exploded \u201clike a pipe bomb\u201d when that happened, Durham says; today\u2019s battery packs have release valves so that during thermal runaway they avoid an explosion by instead spewing flames in what Durham describes as \u201cessentially a blowtorch.\u201d The location of an EV\u2019s battery\u2014underneath the car, between its axles, within a protective case\u2014complicates things further. The batteries are much safer from collision damage than they would be under the hood, but they are also much harder to reach and douse if they ignite. The result? Fires such as one at an Illinois Rivian plant in 2024, where one EV caught fire and approximately 50 cars parked nearby ended up burning. Or one in Hollywood, Florida, in 2023, where a Tesla was accidentally driven off a dock and burst into flames even though it was underwater. Durham worries that if an EV battery catches fire in a high-speed crash, it will burn so intensely that first responders won\u2019t be able to save anyone inside the vehicle. Putting out a fire in an internal-combustion car might take as little as 30 minutes and a few hundred gallons of water, he notes, while an electric car battery fire could take upwards of 4,000 gallons of water and many hours to extinguish\u2014and much more for commercial trucks. Indeed, when a Tesla Semi drove off Interstate 80 in Northern California in 2024 and burst into flames, first responders had to douse it with 50,000 gallons of water and close the highway for 15 hours.",
    "What\u2019s more, with EVs, it\u2019s never entirely clear whether the fire is truly out. Cars may ignite, or reignite, weeks or even months after the battery is damaged or a battery fire is initially suppressed. Durham points to one salvaged Tesla in California that burst into flames 308 days after it had flooded in a Florida hurricane. The vehicle hadn\u2019t initially ignited, but saltwater intrusion into the battery pack eventually corroded it enough to produce a chemical fire leading to thermal runaway. According to Durham, the simple truth is that the best way to manage EV fires right now is to let them burn\u2014while making sure to protect the surrounding area, including other vehicles and people\u2019s homes. Allowing the fire to run its course will ideally also destroy any cells that might otherwise ignite later. This goes against firefighters\u2019 instincts. When they respond to EV fires, they will spray water \u201cbecause they want to do something to fix the problem,\u201d he says. [But] \u2026 it\u2019s not really doing anything.\u201d Stevenson worries about how bystanders will perceive\u00a0 first responders waiting out a blaze. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ugly,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the public\u2019s going to see us standing on the side [of the] road just watching it burn, which looks bad for us.\u201d But at the same time, he adds, \u201cwe don\u2019t have [an] actual way of getting to the battery to knock it out.\u201d Related StoryWhy EVs are (mostly) set for solid growth in 2025What happens in the US, however, will depend a lot on the incoming Trump administration.",
    "For now, Durham\u2019s training focuses on the options that first responders do have with EV fires. An important if simple one is using a fire blanket to cover a vehicle and prevent the blaze from spreading as it burns out. Although they hadn\u2019t yet received Durham\u2019s training, that\u2019s exactly what McGoldrick and his crew did when they responded to the burning Tesla last fall: After the facility used a forklift to move the burning car to an isolated part of the yard, first responders covered it with a fire blanket. The car reignited several times over the next few days, McGoldrick says, \u201cbut it was contained. We just put it in the middle of an open lot and basically let it go.\u201d It\u2019s a significant cultural shift that first responders need to make, Durham says, and there\u2019s another one, too: being extra-vigilant about the personal protective equipment they wear from the first moment they arrive at a burning EV. There isn\u2019t yet enough information to compare the toxicity of EV fires and those in gas-powered cars, but Durham warns that first responders could inhale high levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and heavy metals from burning EVs. Overall, Durham says, he is not against EVs, but he thinks there needs to be a change in attitude to handle them safely. When an EV battery catches fire, he says, \u201cuntil that battery has been removed from the vehicle and shredded and fully recycled, it\u2019s always going be a hazard.\u201d Maya L.
