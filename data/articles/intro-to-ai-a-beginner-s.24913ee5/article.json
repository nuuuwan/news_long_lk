    "It feels as though AI is moving a million miles a minute. Every week, it seems, there are product launches, fresh features and other innovations, and new concerns over ethics and privacy. It\u2019s a lot to keep up with. Maybe you wish someone would just take a step back and explain some of the basics.\u00a0 Look no further. Intro to AI is MIT Technology Review\u2019s first newsletter that also serves as a mini-course. You\u2019ll get one email a week for six weeks, and each edition will walk you through a different topic in AI.\u00a0 Sign up here to receive it for free. Or if you\u2019re already an AI aficionado, send it on to someone in your life who\u2019s curious about the technology but is just starting to explore what it all means.",
    "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:  Week 1: What is AI?\u00a0  We\u2019ll review a (very brief) history of AI and learn common terms like large language models, machine learning, and generative AI.",
    "Week 2: What you can do with AI\u00a0  Explore ways you can use AI in your life. We\u2019ve got recommendations and exercises to help you get acquainted with specific AI tools. Plus, you\u2019ll learn about a few things AI can\u2019t do (yet).\u00a0  Week 3: How to talk about AI\u00a0  We all want to feel confident in talking about AI, whether it\u2019s with our boss, our best friend, or our kids. We\u2019ll help you find ways to frame these chats and keep AI\u2019s pros and cons in mind.\u00a0  Week 4: AI traps to watch out for\u00a0  We\u2019ll cover the most common problems with modern AI systems so that you can keep an eye out for yourself and others.\u00a0  Week 5: Working with AI\u00a0  How will AI change our jobs? How will companies handle any efficiencies created by AI? Our reporters and editors help cut through the noise and even give a little advice on how to think about your own career in the context of AI.\u00a0  Week 6: Does AI need tougher rules?\u00a0  AI tools can cause very real harm if not properly used, and regulation is one way to address this danger. The last edition of the newsletter breaks down the status of AI regulation across the globe, including a close look at the EU\u2019s AI Act and a primer on what the US has done so far.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much to learn and say about this powerful new technology. Sign up for Intro to AI and let\u2019s leap into the big, weird world of AI together. hide"
