    "Sri Lanka\u2019s chequered history of coalition politics wreaking havoc on the nation\u2019s growth, development progress speaks volumes for the fallout from a lack of such agreement and cohesion",
    "In Sri Lanka, in 2024/2025 and beyond, this takes on added emphasis in the time of not only presidential and parliamentary elections, but the process of system change following regime change",
    "We\u2019ve seen how the vision of transparency and accountability stumbled and fell headlong when the proponents of the programme were detected with their friends\u2019 hands rummaging around in state coffers: seen under Good Governance as much as GR",
    "Perhaps one could cite Jayewardene v. Premadasa, Kumaratunga v. Wickremesinghe, and Wickremesinghe v. Sirisena as characteristic of the partnership-relationships that failed to succeed in the governance project?",
    "The ships of state of JR, CBK, RW, MR and GR all foundered on these shoals to Sri Lanka\u2019s great distress at the time \u2013 national calamities from which our image is still recovering",
    "The failure of the Rajapaksa regime to beat their swords into ploughshares, but rather continue the ethnic war by political means, exemplifies such lack of imagination and integrity",
    "Is it only charismatic leaders and dynamic political messiahs who deliver results? We continue from where last week\u2019s column began to analyse political leadership styles along the paradigms of definitions, theories, styles and roles; by adding processes, values, impacts and frameworks.",
    "The discussion of the past weeks feeds food for thought into the much debated smorgasbord of an issue \u2013 as to whether Sri Lanka ever truly benefitted from the \u2018strongman\u2019 model of political leadership, as was assumed in the past for a plethora of reasons, including patriotism and propaganda machines doing their part.",
    "This ongoing survey of the extant literature on key facets of political leadership the world over is an attempt to discern if there is an ideal model \u2013 one that would lead Sri Lanka away from the myths about political saviours and the misadventures of national messiahship in which we as a country and people suffered.",
    "Processes follow on from roles played by leaders. And because \u201cpolitical leaders gain their initial authority through election not appointment, they require continuing consent from those who they govern and serve\u201d (Hartley, 2010), which is a cyclical and even chronic process.",
    "Other processes entailed in political leadership necessitate \u201cmaintaining a critical mass of political support, developing strategic policy direction, seeking to further leadership priorities outside the organization [or party, or government organ such as cabinet, or legislative assembly] and ensuring task accomplishment\u201d (Hartley, 2010).",
    "The failure of \u2018I am the state\u2019 approaches and \u2018government by gazette\u2019 under the Gotabaya administration reek of such conflation of authority and leadership, and the ensuing confusion that ended in national bankruptcy",
    "Three types of political leadership are also involved in processes: to wit, the \u2018Creative\u2019 type/style \u2013 demonstrating \u201can effective ability for the new development of the system\u201d; the \u2018Administrative\u2019 type \u2013 showing \u201ceffective ability for efficient management of operations and the nation in an existing system\u201d; and the \u2018Symbolic\u2019 style \u2013 leading with \u201ceffective ability in a mature country and society in the process of establishing traditional values and a sense of loyalty\u201d (Ishii, 2010).",
    "Processes in political leadership have ups and downs, especially as \u201crelationships inside a partnership can be damaged by processes or assumptions that don\u2019t take account of the fact that partnerships have to work differently \u2026 and by the failure of partners to recognize their own cultural assumptions about what is \u2018normal\u2019\u201d (Goss and Tarplett, 2010). Perhaps one could cite Jayewardene v. Premadasa, Kumaratunga v. Wickremesinghe, and Wickremesinghe v. Sirisena as characteristic of the partnership-relationships that failed to succeed in the governance project?",
    "The process of working with others in political leadership involves a \u2018transaction cost\u2019, which is \u201ctypically time spent discussing and agreeing what to do and how to do it\u201d (Goss and Tarplett, 2010); and the more people who are involved, the greater these transaction costs tend to be. Cohabitation (2001-2004) and Yahapalanaya (2015-2019) were short-lived experiments that had such costs, which set the national developmental clock back by years if not decades!",
    "However, as some point out, \u201crather than seeing these additional costs as a problem, it is possible to see \u2018the cost\u2019 of additional time spent thinking and understanding each other as a benefit\u201d (Goss and Tarplett, 2010). Dare we essay that the NPP and the JVP start doing the same... in our national interest, as much as theirs.",
    "Political leadership processes involve fresh ideas and novel ways of interacting with partners in the projects at hand, as \u201cthe complex cross-cutting problems facing citizens and communities require governments to develop new paradigms of whole thinking, and new patterns of inter-organizational working for [better] outcomes\u201d (Benington and Hartley, 2010).",
    "As projects, parties and partnerships grow, evolve and change, Turnbull observes \u2013 quoting Larry Griener writing in The Harvard Business Review (Griener, 1998) \u2013 that \u201cthe original creative activities are not always the most appropriate to lead the organisation through predicted periods of both evolution and revolution\u201d (Turnbull, 2010). The failure of the Rajapaksa regime to beat their swords into ploughshares, but rather continue the ethnic war by political means, exemplifies such lack of imagination and integrity.",
    "Grenier adds: \u201cBoth the original founders and their chosen ways of working \u2013 which were essential for the company [or party, project, or political organ] to get off the ground \u2013 may become a problem as the company grows\u201d (Turnbull, 2010), which becomes a challenge to leading a winning team through a collective vision. The loss of popular support for the jingoistic Rajapaksa war machine when the conflict came home to roost among southern dissenters is a case in point.",
    "Another key challenge is \u201cthe extent to which leaders agree and achieve a cohesive vision when faced with divergent cognitive sets\u201d (Leli\u00e8vre-Finch, 2010). Again, Sri Lanka\u2019s chequered history of coalition politics wreaking havoc on the nation\u2019s growth, development progress speaks volumes for the fallout from a lack of such agreement and cohesion.",
    "A decade and more ago, some academics felt that \u201cthe time is now ripe for a major new initiative to promote and cultivate leadership capabilities for working across the public service system\u201d (Benington and Hartley, 2010).",
    "In Sri Lanka, in 2024/2025 and beyond, this takes on added emphasis in the time of not only presidential and parliamentary elections, but the process of system change following regime change.",
    "For political leadership, a person\u2019s values are \u201can integral part of the office\u201d (Du Gay, 2000; 2005) and \u201cleadership in this context is linked to organizational turnaround and change management\u201d (Salaman, 2005). We\u2019ve seen how the vision of transparency and accountability stumbled and fell headlong when the proponents of the programme were detected with their friends\u2019 hands rummaging around in state coffers: seen under Good Governance as much as GR.",
    "And for shared political leadership in a team context, \u201conly minor variances exist between followers and leaders\u201d (Burns, 2003) while \u201cindividual, climate, and group interaction processes [work] as predictors of work team innovation\u201d (Burns and West, 2003).",
    "In such a sharing of leadership as well as values, \u201cpartnership working cannot be successful without agreeing collectively to a set of shared goals\u201d (Goss, 2005) and \u201cwithout shared goals, partnerships often exhibit what we have called the \u2018leadership paradox\u2019 \u2013 a partnership full of proven and successful leaders in which no one is demonstrating leadership\u201d (Goss and Tarplett, 2010). We could cite the so-called Viyathmaga fiasco as an instance of such a paradox, where latterly at least the experts and professionals were as guilty as bumbling amateurs of successive imbroglios?",
    "Where goals are not necessarily at least initially shared or where partnerships have yet to be formed and formalized, \u201cleaders must be able to engage with dissimilar stakeholders and mobilize support for defined causes acceptable to all\u201d (Leli\u00e8vre-Finch, 2010).",
    "And where political leadership runs the risk of being compromised because values and where these values derive from are not explicit, leaders must pay \u201ccareful attention to the sources of legitimacy \u2026 including clarifying the relationship between authority and leadership\u201d (Hartley, 2010). The failure of \u2018I am the state\u2019 approaches and \u2018government by gazette\u2019 under the Gotabaya administration reek of such conflation of authority and leadership, and the ensuing confusion that ended in national bankruptcy.",
    "Most helpful in our later formulation of a Sri Lankan leadership framework are the following from Turnbull: that it is important to \u201cexemplify values and integrity\u201d; to value \u201cdiversity, including diversity of thought\u201d; improve performance, maintaining \u201coptimism and energy\u201d; set \u201ca tone of openness\u201d and \u201ca consistent course\u201d; show \u201cability to take decisions\u201d; encourage \u201cpartnership and sharing\u201d; and \u201ctreat others as you would wish to be treated yourself\u201d (Turnbull, 2010). The ships of state of JR, CBK, RW, MR and GR all foundered on these shoals to Sri Lanka\u2019s great distress at the time \u2013 national calamities from which our image is still recovering.",
    "In an age where everything is results-oriented, political leadership is much more than the sum of its processes. American philosopher Sydney Hook, elaborating on this, highlighted the impact that could be made by the \u2018eventful man\u2019 compared to the \u2018event-making man\u2019 (Dobbins and Platz, 1986).",
    "If, per Drucker et al., \u201cleadership is about \u2018doing the right things\u2019 and management is about \u2018doing things right\u2019\u201d (Drucker, 1966; 1986; Drucker and Zahra, 2003), then governance is about \u201censuring that the right things are done by the right people, in the right way, in the right places with and for the right people\u201d (Brookes, 2010). If only the \u2018Good Governance\u2019 impetus of 2015 had lasted beyond the Central Bank expose, a resurgence of ultra-nationalism would not have made a farrago of fiscal policy as it did in the years between 2019 and 2022.",
    "It is also clear leaders are expected to focus on their followers\u2019 needs and \u201cinput into their lives in such a way as to empower and motivate them, and transform them into leaders themselves\u201d (House and Aditya, 1997).",
    "This leader-follower dynamic is influenced by the nuance that \u201cskilled leaders in partnerships will be more interested in achieving the right result than being seen to be in charge\u201d (Goss and Tarplett, 2010).",
    "Unsurprisingly, such leadership has to \u201cresist the pressure from followers to act as a god or guru who can provide magical solutions to complex problems, and instead has to persuade stakeholders to accept themselves as part of the whole system, and therefore part of the problem\u201d (Benington and Hartley, 2010).",
    "Political leadership is also about the following factors: balance of diverse public good objectives; subordination of local or specific organizational objectives to the pursuit of the public good; and recognition of ultimate accountability to the electorate (Tilley, 2010).",
    "In addition, elected politicians have to address complex and difficult choices facing society (such as climate change, power generation or sorting out transportation infrastructure) and so \u201cthe role of politicians is not only to use state authority and state resources [but] in some cases, their role is to tackle complex problems and make tough choices, knowing that whatever decision is made it will not please everyone\u201d (Hartley, 2010).",
    "There is a fine line to be trodden by political leadership in these instances, since they \u201cuse state authority to direct or even coerce citizens to engage in activities deemed to be for the public good\u201d (such as \u201cgoing to war, taxation levels, police powers and military conscription\u201d [and] \u201ctheir decisions involve judgments based on political leadership\u201d (Hartley, 2010) and related savvy, skills and experience to make an impact.",
    "Certainly, and perhaps contrarily to our hopes or expectations, impactful national leaders \u201ccan have huge influence on economic progression [and such] leaders have [the] highest impact in autocracies, where they seem to considerably influence both economic development and the evolution of political organizations\u201d (Ahmad, Jan and Irem, 2017).",
    "That \u201cthese results call for amplified focus on national economic strategies and the procedure of leadership selection\u201d (Ahmad, Jan and Irem, 2017) leads us to consider frameworks for political leadership next.",
    "Some academics have classified leadership into four frames: structural, human resources, political and symbolic (Ahmad, Jan and Irem, 2017). These thinkers emphasise \u201ca need for leadership that links the political, racial, cultural and economic boundaries\u201d (Ahmad, Jan and Irem, 2017). And although there exists a certain degree of agreement on the relevance of political leadership theory and practice, \u201cthere is still deficiency in literature on viable approaches, enabling factors and suitable personality characteristics\u201d (Ofusu-Anim and Back, 2021).",
    "On the contrary, other thinkers on political leadership note that there are \u201cnumerous explanations, classifications, theories and definitions about leadership\u201d in the contemporary literature, and they add that \u201csubstantial effort has gone in to classify and clarify different dimensions of active leadership, thus generating considerable organizational and social research of leadership styles and behaviours\u201d (Khan, Nawaz and Khan, 2016).",
    "One most valuable element that emerges in such efforts is the recognition that if \u201cthe creation and demonstration of public value is the key outcome of effective public leadership, then the development of trust and legitimacy by public leaders must therefore represent one of the key determinants of a new public leadership framework\u201d [and] \u201cthe importance of trust in engaging with stakeholders cannot be underestimated\u201d (Brookes and Grint, 2010).",
    "In formulating a holistic framework based on all of the above in the literature on leadership and political leadership, the trio of ideas below will be helpful.",
    "That \u201cthe purpose of public leadership is to set out clearly what it is that public leaders seek to attain through clearly stated intentions or aims\u201d...",
    "That \u201cthe process of public leadership represents the sequence of leadership actions that are required to transform the purpose of public leadership into a practice and how activities are coordinated\u201d...",
    "And that \u201cthe praxis of public leadership represents the actual practice of particular public leadership styles at all levels\u201d (Brookes, 2010).",
    "To be concluded next week...",
