Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and foreign affairs minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash in the west of the country. His death is expected to trigger an election within 50 days, and though it won't likely change the current conservative policy direction, it will create significant political uncertainty and intense competition for power, particularly with regards to the succession of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While no foul play is suspected in the crash, an investigation is pending. Deputy Mohammad Mokhber will temporarily replace Raisi. The upcoming presidential election is expected to be fiercely contested between ultra-conservatives and more moderate factions, but major policy change is unlikely.
