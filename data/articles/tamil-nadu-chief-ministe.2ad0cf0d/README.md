Mu. Ka. Muthu, the eldest son of the late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and half-brother of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, died in Chennai on Saturday (July 19, 2025). He had been ailing for a long time. He was 77 and is survived by his wife, son, and daughter.

Mr. Muthu was born to Karunanidhi’s first wife Padmavathi, daughter of Chidambaram Padagasundaram Pillai, a renowned musician and composer. His maternal uncle, C.S. Jayaraman — a playback singer — rendered many songs for Sivaji Ganesan-starrers, including his debut film Parasakthi.

The way Mr. Muthu styled himself after MGR, even affecting a physical resemblance, was a source of some discomfort for his family. Mr. Muthu was promoted as an actor by Karunanidhi’s family to produce a home-grown hero, as there was always tension between the DMK and film stars associated with the party. Actors like Sivaji Ganesan, M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), and poet Kannadasan were all once close to Karunanidhi.

Trained in music, Mr. Muthu also rendered songs for films in which he was cast as a hero. His maiden feature film was Pillaiyo Pillai, released in 1970. Interestingly, it was MGR who launched this film, the first in which Mr. Muthu was cast as a hero, and he even presented him with a gold watch. He later appeared in films such as Samayalkaran, Anayavilaku, Ingeyum Manidhargal, and Pookari.

The songs from these films — particularly “Kaadhalin Pon Veethiyil” and “Muthupal Siripennavo” in Pookari; “Meenattam Kankonda Meenatchi” and “Moontru Thamizh” in Pillaiyo Pillai; and “Nalla Manathil Kudiyirukkum Nagoor Andava,” sung by Muthu in Anayavilaku — continue to enchant generations of cinema lovers.

“Mr. Muthu could have emerged as a successful film personality had he relied on his talents as a singer and actor. But his language, song sequences, and even hairstyle resembled those of MGR. This was one of the factors that contributed to the misunderstandings between MGR and Karunanidhi,” Subagunarajan, editor, Katchipizhai, once told The Hindu, noting that MGR continued to patronise Mr. Muthu even after leaving the DMK.

When Mr. Muthu wanted to join the AIADMK, MGR refused to admit him into the party. However, he eventually received financial assistance from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the early 1990s.

While his film career failed to take off, he also was not successful in politics. He faded into obscurity over the years.

Karunanidhi and Mr. Muthu finally came together again in 2008 when the latter turned 60. It was then that he sought to remake his public image by singing a song composed by Deva for the film Maatu Thavani.

His body was placed at his father’s residence in Gopalapuram. Mr. Stalin and other political leaders paid tribute to Mr. Muthu’s mortal remains.

‘Showed affection like a father’: Stalin

Condoling the death of Mr. Muthu, Mr. Stalin said he had lost a brother who showered affection on him like a father.

In his condolence message, he said Mr. Muthu was named after their grandfather, Muthuvelar. “Like Kalaignar, he was involved in theatre, and worked for the Dravidian movement,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said Mr. Muthu developed his own body language and style of dialogue delivery, and that his talent paved the way for his entry into films in 1970. He played a dual role in his very first film.

“He had a talent for singing, which is not possessed by many actors,” Mr. Stalin said.

The Chief Minister added that Mr. Muthu was very fond of him and encouraged him in politics. “He would share memories of the old days whenever I met him. He will continue to live on in our memories and in the hearts of the people through his art and songs,” Mr. Stalin said.

‘An irreversible loss’

Mr. Muthu reflected his father’s passion for Tamil and political emotions in various phases of his life, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said.
