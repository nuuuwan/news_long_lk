An abstract representation that illustrates the transformation from equality and equity

Equity is about ensuring fairness by recognising and addressing the individual needs, challenges, and circumstances of each person, while equality treats everyone the same. In Sri Lanka’s evolving landscape, equity—not just equality—has become crucial for building performance-driven organisations. By focusing on equitable pay, gender equity, career progression, and workplace inclusivity, businesses can unlock their full potential while navigating the challenges of equity-based policies.

Equality: A necessary but limited starting point

Equality ensures fairness by providing equal opportunities, such as equal pay for equal work, and prevents discrimination. However, it can fall short of fostering growth. Treating everyone the same may not address individual needs or encourage high performance. As Jim Collins aptly put it, “Good is the enemy of great.” While equality is important for fairness, equity inspires growth and progress.

Equity: Unlocking individual potential

Equity goes beyond treating everyone the same. It tailors resources, opportunities, and rewards to meet individuals’ unique needs. For example, while twin daughters may have received identical gifts as children to avoid jealousy, as they grew, their mother provided them with tailored support based on their talents—art supplies for one, a chemistry set for the other. Similarly, workplaces must nurture employees’ distinct strengths and challenges.

Equitable pay: A key pillar of equity

Equitable pay involves ensuring employees are rewarded fairly based on their contributions, through internal and external equity.

Internal equity: Ensures that employees with similar roles and responsibilities are compensated fairly. Key practices include job evaluation, transparent pay structures, and performance-based rewards.

External equity: Ensures competitive pay within the broader labour market. This involves market benchmarking, adjusting for regional variations, and retaining top talent.

Without attention to both internal and external equity, organisations risk disengagement and losing talent to competitors.

Gender equity: Recognising unique needs

Gender equality provides identical opportunities, but gender equity acknowledges that women face unique challenges such as balancing caregiving, and menstruation. Key initiatives for gender equity include:

Flexible work arrangements

Comprehensive maternity and paternity benefits

On-site child care or subsidies

Menstrual health support

Policies for women experiencing menopause

Addressing these needs creates inclusive environments that foster engagement, productivity, and innovation.

Equity in training ensures learning opportunities are tailored to individual needs and aspirations. This includes personalised learning paths, need-based access to development opportunities, and bridging digital divides. These initiatives support continuous growth and foster a culture of improvement.

Career equity: Recognising merit and potential

Career progression must be based on merit, not favouritism or seniority. Equity in career development involves transparent criteria, personalised development plans, and mentorship programs. By ensuring that opportunities are based on individual strengths, organisations motivate employees to excel, thereby driving performance.

Challenges of implementing equity

While equity offers substantial benefits, its implementation poses challenges. In Sri Lanka, where uniformity is often equated with fairness, equity-driven policies may face resistance. Key challenges include:

Cultural resistance to equity-based practices

Balancing diverse needs with available resources

Avoiding bias and favouritism in policy application

Addressing dissatisfaction during the transition to equity

The benefits of equity-driven cultures

Despite the challenges, an equity-driven culture can result in transformative benefits, such as:

Enhanced employee engagement and motivation

Improved performance through tailored support

Increased innovation from diverse perspectives

Long-term growth by aligning individual and organisational goals

A call to action for Sri Lanka

As Sri Lanka strives for fairer workplaces, organisations must recognise that equality is just the first step. Equity provides the nuanced fairness necessary to unlock individual and collective potential. By embracing equitable pay structures, addressing gender-specific challenges, and promoting merit-based career progression, Sri Lankan businesses can create resilient, performance-driven cultures ready to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

As the saying goes, “Equality is giving everyone the same pair of shoes. Equity is giving everyone a pair of shoes that fits.” It’s time for Sri Lanka to step confidently toward a brighter, fairer future.
