Continuous learning is the key to having lasting influence in your career, yet a heavy workload makes it hard to find the time. To ensure you’re creating opportunities even when you’re feeling depleted or overwhelmed, try these five strategies: 1) Challenge your beliefs about your capacity; 2) Start with topics that solve urgent problems; 3) Don’t limit yourself to formal programs; 4) Make an emotional connection to learning; and 5) Work with your brain, not against it.

Whether you want to advance in leadership or stay relevant where you are, continuous learning is critical to success. After all, if you’re not evolving in this ever-changing world, you may not only get left behind the competition — you could find that your current skills aren’t even needed anymore.
