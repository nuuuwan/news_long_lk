To ensure you\u2019re creating opportunities even when you\u2019re feeling depleted or overwhelmed, try these five strategies: 1) Challenge your beliefs about your capacity; 2) Start with topics that solve urgent problems; 3) Don\u2019t limit yourself to formal programs; 4) Make an emotional connection to learning; and 5) Work with your brain, not against it.",
    "Whether you want to advance in leadership or stay relevant where you are, continuous learning is critical to success. After all, if you\u2019re not evolving in this ever-changing world, you may not only get left behind the competition \u2014 you could find that your current skills aren\u2019t even needed anymore.",
