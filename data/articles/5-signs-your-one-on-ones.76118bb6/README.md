Despite all that one-on-one meetings can offer, they can be challenging to navigate, whether you’re new to management or have spent several years in a leadership role. Here some signs that your one-on-ones have gone stale, are unproductive, or are falling short of their potential: you don’t want to go to the meeting, you always go over time, you can’t fill the time, you leave every meeting feeling deflated, or you and your direct report are both on second screens. The author presents several ways to make the most of this valuable time.

One-on-ones are ongoing meetings between managers and their direct reports. For managers, these weekly or biweekly exchanges typically have two objectives: aligning on expectations and building trust with team members. Beyond this, one-on-ones encourage deeper boss-employee relationships and can be used to give and receive feedback, set individual goals, and troubleshoot roadblocks.
