But new research suggests that companies\u2019 organizational structures may be better predictors of employee success. In a study of 192 expatriate general managers in charge of hotel properties in nine global hotel chains, researchers found that whether or not these employees succeeded in their new environment rested on the degree to which their organization offered them three key elements: high decentralization (empowering local managers to make decisions), high formalization (providing clear guidelines and policies), and ample global knowledge integration (tools and systems that enable cross-border collaboration). Those employees whose companies possessed all three were the most likely to successfully complete their assignment and reported the highest levels of commitment to their organization.",

These failures can drain millions of dollars in productivity, rehiring costs, and strained stakeholder relationships. Conventional wisdom suggests that success hinges on selecting the \u201cright\u201d expatriates \u2014 those with extensive international experience and high cultural intelligence.",
