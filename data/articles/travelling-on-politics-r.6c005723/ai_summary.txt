Sri Lanka's political system allows for the offspring of older politicians to enter politics, often without proven track records. Despite this, some politicians have been successfully groomed for political roles, such as J.R. Jayewardene's nurturing of Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake. However, both men were assassinated before they could reach the highest levels of office. The system is criticized for its lack of structure compared to businesses, where the next leader is groomed and there's no room for people with career black marks. The trend of political dynasties also persists in the present political setup, despite some politicians advising their children to wait their turn.
