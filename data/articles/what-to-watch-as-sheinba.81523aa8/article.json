    "What to watch as Sheinbaum\u2019s presidency begins",
    "EconomyForecastingPoliticsRegulationAmericasMexicoCountry Analysis",
    "Claudia Sheinbaum of the ruling left-wing Movimiento Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional (Morena) begins her six-year term as president on October 1st. Her first few months in office will reveal how she intends to govern, as well as how much latitude she has to implement her policy agenda. Important determinants will include her relationship with Morena hardliners, as well as the result of the November US presidential election, both of which carry distinct implications for Mexico\u2019s economic outlook.",
    "Ms Sheinbaum begins her presidency in a privileged position. She won the June presidential election by a\u00a0landslide, she holds the support of the popular outgoing president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and her party commands supermajorities in the new Congress. However, questions abound over whether she will stick to Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policy programme, whether she has the political capital to implement a different agenda and what her presidency will mean for Mexico\u2019s\u00a0shaky economic outlook. This article examines three factors (domestic and external) that we believe will set the initial course of her presidency.",
    "Morena ideologue or pragmatic technocrat?",
    "Despite her detailed platform and strong public profile since winning the election, it remains unclear in which ideological direction Ms Sheinbaum intends to take her administration.\u00a0She is a long-standing ally of Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador and has broadly backed continuing his nationalist and populist agenda, which includes heavy social spending and maintaining the state\u2019s strong role in the economy, not least via Pemex, the heavily indebted state-owned oil company. However, her 100-point programme and appointment of a mostly\u00a0moderate and well-qualified cabinet\u00a0suggest that she will prioritise more orthodox policies, even if her stated goal is to advance Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201cFourth Transformation\u201d movement. This more orthodox approach would include encouraging private and foreign investment, accelerating Mexico\u2019s green transition and promoting infrastructure development on competitiveness (rather than social) grounds\u2014all actions that Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador eschewed.",
    "Although we have long believed that Ms Sheinbaum will be\u00a0more pragmatic and less populist\u00a0than Mr\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador, she will still face major constraints in implementing her policy priorities.\u00a0One obstacle is Congress; her party holds a supermajority in each chamber, but Morena hardliners who would baulk at any substantial deviation from Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s agenda occupy many of those seats. The fact that most Morena voters remain fiercely loyal to Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador will further limit her room for manoeuvre, particularly as she could face a recall referendum, instituted by Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador himself, that could result in her ouster just halfway into her term. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has pledged to retire from politics and has endorsed Ms Sheinbaum taking full control over her presidency. However, the recent appointment of his son as Morena party secretary implies that the outgoing president will maintain a strong influence; Mr\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s son may well emerge as a rival to Ms Sheinbaum for control over the party during her\u00a0presidency.",
    "We expect that this tension between Ms Sheinbaum\u2019s priorities and Morena\u2019s hardline wing will dictate the formulation and implementation of policy during her term. Her budget proposal, which she will present to Congress in November, will provide an early test of how and whether she manages to balance the two. The document will also signal how she intends to address the government\u2019s\u00a0widening fiscal deficit, which we expect to weigh on her spending plans.",
    "Will Sheinbaum reshape the constitutional reform process?",
    "Another open question is how Ms Sheinbaum will shape Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s ongoing constitutional reform effort, which we believe would weaken Mexico\u2019s economic outlook if implemented in full. Mr\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador has managed to push some of these reforms through the new Morena-led Congress, which has already been in office for a month. These include a judicial reform that allows for the popular election of judges and a security reform that gives the military a larger role in public safety. Both reforms have attracted sharp criticism from the business community, as well as from the US and Canadian governments, owing to concerns over the rule of law, institutional transparency and the country\u2019s\u00a0long-standing issues with violence. Ms Sheinbaum now faces the task of implementing these reforms, as well as pushing Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s other controversial proposals\u2014including changes to the electoral system and the elimination of independent regulatory agencies\u2014through Congress.",
    "We continue to believe that Ms Sheinbaum will\u00a0water down the reforms, to the benefit of the business environment, but her room to manoeuvre will be limited.\u00a0Passing and implementing the reforms will require input from Congress, which ignored her call not to rush changes to the judicial system. Markets have shrugged off some initial worries about the judicial reform, with the peso recouping some of its recent losses. However,\u00a0there is a limit to this risk tolerance, and we believe that this will become more apparent as the reform process pushes ahead.\u00a0If Ms Sheinbaum fails to blunt the more disruptive elements of Mr\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s reforms, during either their development or their implementation, we would expect Mexico\u2019s already-tepid economic outlook to deteriorate further.",
    "Will Sheinbaum face a Harris or Trump US presidency?",
    "The US presidential election in November presents distinct scenarios for the future of US-Mexico relations, with implications for Ms Sheinbaum\u2019s foreign policy and for Mexico\u2019s economic outlook. Regardless of the election result, we expect Ms Sheinbaum to inherit some lingering bilateral trade tensions, including over Mexico\u2019s\u00a0protectionist energy policies. She will also face increasing pressure to crack down on Chinese investment in Mexico owing to rising US concerns about China using Mexico as a \u201cback door\u201d into the US market. The recent constitutional reforms will be an additional point of contention and will probably weigh on the renewal of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026, without necessarily derailing it. Ms Sheinbaum will also confront calls for Mexico to play a larger role in US border security as both Democratic and Republican US lawmakers respond to\u00a0heightened voter concerns\u00a0about illegal immigration.",
    "Whether or not these issues upend US-Mexico relations will depend heavily on the next US administration.\u00a0We believe that escalation risks would be low under a Harris presidency, which we would expect to prioritise the bilateral relationship, as the current Democratic president, Joe Biden, has done. Ms Harris\u2019s favourable views on nearshoring, her plans to continue Mr Biden\u2019s green energy subsidies (from which\u00a0Mexico benefits) and her broadly collaborative approach to migration management would bode well for bilateral ties. This would also ensure a\u00a0fairly smooth\u00a0USMCA renewal process, to the benefit of Mexico\u2019s trade and investment prospects. The shared experience of Ms Sheinbaum and Ms Harris as their countries\u2019 first female presidents, both with leftist agendas, could enhance bilateral co-operation further.",
    "Our outlook for US-Mexico relations is more pessimistic under a Trump administration.\u00a0Ms Sheinbaum would have a much less reliable partner in Mr Trump than in Ms Harris and would be unlikely to forge the surprising rapport that Mr Trump had with Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador. Bilateral relations would become more erratic and combative, as occurred during Mr Trump\u2019s last term in office. Tariff threats would be a key feature of his approach, particularly for achieving his goals of reducing the growing US trade deficit with Mexico, tightening immigration restrictions and countering China. The USMCA renewal would be more tumultuous, especially as we would expect Mr Trump to treat the process as a full renegotiation. A\u00a0US exit from the agreement\u00a0would be unlikely. However, Mr Trump\u2019s hostile rhetoric towards nearshoring (which he views as a threat to US manufacturing) and his\u00a0efforts to limit Mr Biden\u2019s green subsidies\u00a0would weigh on Mexico\u2019s investment, trade and growth prospects while also subjecting the peso to bouts of volatility.",
