The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lost its national majority following significant losses in key states. After all votes were counted from the six-week-long election, the BJP had won 240 seats in the lower house of parliament, falling short of the 272 needed for a majority. In contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, was projected to win over 200 seats. Despite the losses, the BJP could still form the next government with the help of allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), who are projected to win around 282 seats. While the BJP made inroads in southern India, it suffered major losses in central Hindi-speaking states.
