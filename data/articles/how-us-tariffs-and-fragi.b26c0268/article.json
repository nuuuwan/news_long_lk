    "The damage we\u2019ve done to our export economy over the years\u2014through poor policies and neglect\u2014is far greater than what any foreign government could impose on us. The question now is whether we are willing to fix it \u2013 Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne",
    "Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne",
    "As Sri Lanka navigates the delicate path of economic recovery, two mounting challenges have converged to expose deep-rooted vulnerabilities in its export economy: the appreciation of the rupee over the past two years and a fresh wave of reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States. For a country where nearly a quarter of exports are US-bound, these developments carry serious implications\u2014not just for revenue, but for investment, competitiveness, and long-term growth.",
    "According to leading economist Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne, these pressures should be seen less as external shocks and more as symptoms of underlying structural gaps. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just what Trump did,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that Sri Lanka has been running an overly protective and inefficient trade regime for decades. What this tariff move has done is hold a mirror up to our own weaknesses.\u201d",
    "The newly proposed US tariff regime, introduced under the justification of \u2018reciprocal trade fairness,\u2019 penalises countries running large bilateral trade surpluses with the US. Sri Lanka, despite its relatively small export volume, is among the top targets. Apparel exporters\u2014already grappling with squeezed margins\u2014will be faced with an additional 44% duty from 8 July, on top of the existing Most Favoured Nation tariff rate, threatening their foothold in key global markets. The bigger risk, Prof. Abeyratne warns, is not just losing market share, but losing investments altogether. \u201cIf it becomes cheaper to produce in Vietnam or Bangladesh, export oriented companies especially apparel will follow the logic of survival\u2014and shift operations.",
    "Currency volatility adds another layer to this precarious equation. While the Central Bank\u2019s recent management has kept the rupee around the Rs. 300 mark against the dollar, exporters have seen reduced earnings due to rupee appreciation in the past six months. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an appreciating currency, shrinking export margins, and increased external tariffs all at once. It strangles competitiveness,\u201d notes Prof. Abeyratne. \u201cAnd if the US dollar begins to weaken globally\u2014which is likely, given their own trade contraction and inflationary pressure\u2014that adds a whole new level of unpredictability for us.\u201d",
    "Behind the scenes of these challenges lies an even bigger issue: Sri Lanka\u2019s failure to diversify its markets, modernise its trade policy, and connect to global value chains. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about export-led growth since liberalisation in 1977,\u201d Dr. Abeyratne says. \u201cYet, we\u2019re still stuck at $ 12\u201313 billion in annual exports. That\u2019s not a success story\u2014that\u2019s a serious policy failure.\u201d",
    "Part of the problem, he argues, is self-inflicted. Complex para-tariffs, erratic import controls, and domestic taxes on inputs have made production more expensive and unpredictable. \u201cEven taxes on imports hurt exports\u2014especially in sectors like apparel, where imported raw materials are critical. When you overtax imports, you essentially tax your exporters too.\u201d",
    "While countries like India have signed over 17 comprehensive Free Trade Agreements, Sri Lanka has struggled to expand beyond a handful of partial trade agreements. Public resistance, politicisation, and poor implementation have all contributed to missed opportunities in integrating with regional supply chains. \u201cWe\u2019ve isolated ourselves from global trade patterns, while others moved ahead. Our trade controls are not just outdated\u2014they are counterproductive.\u201d",
    "On the fiscal side, the country\u2019s overdependence on manufacturing and service taxes\u2014nearly 14% of government revenue\u2014presents a further obstacle to reform. Reducing tariffs requires a broader restructuring of the tax system, including stronger mechanisms for direct taxation and digital traceability. \u201cWe need a technology-driven way to monitor income and spending. If India can do this with a population of 1.5 billion, why can\u2019t we manage 22 million?\u201d he asks.",
    "The road ahead is not without options. Prof. Abeyratne believes the 90-day window before full implementation of the US tariffs presents a rare opportunity for introspection\u2014and action. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about salvaging our trade with the US. It\u2019s a wake-up call. We must overhaul our trade policy, streamline our tariff structure E.g.: removing para-tarrifs, and make it easier for exporters to compete globally.\u201d",
    "He also points to the need for a market driven exchange rate policy that supports exporters without destabilising inflation targets. \u201cLetting the rupee gradually depreciate, when done right, can be a powerful tool to maintain export momentum\u2014especially when external conditions are stacked against us.\u201d",
    "In closing, Prof. Abeyratne offers a sobering reminder: \u201cThe damage we\u2019ve done to our export economy over the years\u2014through poor policies and neglect\u2014is far greater than what any foreign government could impose on us. The question now is whether we are willing to fix it.\u201d",
    "Sirimal Abeyratne PhD is Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Currently, he serves as Chair of the Stakeholder Engagement Committee of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Executive Director of the Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA), while contributing to the development policy dialogue and green financing efforts of the country."
