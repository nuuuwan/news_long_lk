While the corporate wellness industry expected to be worth $85 billion by 2030, there’s also evidence that the effectiveness of well-being programs is low, as individual interventions like wellness apps do not address the broader workplace culture. So, do these apps have any place within organizations? Maybe, if they’re part of a much larger strategy. To decide whether investing in an app can really make a difference for your employees, ask four key questions of your organization: Why do we want to invest in an app? How can we set the stage for introducing an app? How do we select the right vendor? And, how do we integrate the app we ultimately choose?

In recent years, mental health and wellness apps have surged in popularity as organizations aim to prioritize employee well-being. These tools promise to raise awareness about mental health and offer features to reduce stress and anxiety, support employees through life’s transitions (such as new parenthood or grief), and address workplace stressors.
