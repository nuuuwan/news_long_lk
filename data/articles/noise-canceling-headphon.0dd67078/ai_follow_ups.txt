1. How precisely does the Target Speech Hearing system recognize and separate chosen voices from the surrounding noise?
2. Can the technology handle multiple languages or is it currently limited to English? 
3. How might the AI compression technique called knowledge distillation impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the system?
4. How successful has the system been in tests, particularly in noisier environments?
5. While the technology is a proof of concept, is there a timeline for when it might become widely available? 
6. Could Target Speech Hearing technology be misused, such as for eavesdropping or privacy invasion?
7. Can the system handle voices that change, such as due to a cold or aging?
8. Would this technology be beneficial for people with hearing impairments or other auditory disorders? Can it be calibrated according to individual needs? 
9. How do "teacher" and "student" models work together to imitate behavior and performance?
10. What are some potential applications, especially in the workplace or public spaces, for this technology? 
11. How can the system be improved to enroll a targeted speaker even when their voice isn't the loudest in the environment? 
12. Are there any concerns about the system draining battery life or requiring significant computing power, and how are these being addressed?
