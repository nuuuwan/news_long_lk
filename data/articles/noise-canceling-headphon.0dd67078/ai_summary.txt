A prototype artificial intelligence (AI) system named Target Speech Hearing allows noise-cancelling headphone users to select a specific person's voice to remain audible while all other sounds are cancelled out. Although currently a proof of concept, the creators are already in discussions to incorporate the technology into popular brands of noise-cancelling earbuds and hearing aids. By utilising an AI compression technique called knowledge distillation, this system allows AI models to work in real time in headphones with limited computing power and battery life. The software trains a smaller model to imitate the performance of a larger model, separating specific voices from the surrounding noise.
