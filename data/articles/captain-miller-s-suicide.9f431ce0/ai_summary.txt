1. 🧐 The Indian and Sri Lankan governments faced a major blow in their operations against the LTTE in 1987, when "Captain Miller," a member of the LTTE, became its first-ever suicide bomber. 
2. 🇱🇰 The Sri Lankan government had just regained control of the Vadamaratchi sector in Jaffna from the LTTE through "Operation Liberation."
3. 🇮🇳 In response, India launched 'Operation Poomaalai' to supply food to civilians in Jaffna under a severe shortage. This operation effectively suspended military operations in Jaffna. 
4. 🐯 The LTTE, facing backlash and weakened morale due to its military setback, set up a massive attack on the Sri Lankan military camp at the Nelliaddy MMV school.
5. 🚛 Two vehicles packed with explosives were driven by LTTE members Miller and Razeek. They were equipped with two detonation devices: one within reach of the drivers and a time-delayed device.
6. 💣 Miller triggered the explosion of his vehicle upon reaching the Nelliaddy camp. However, Razeek's vehicle had an accident before reaching the camp and detonated outside.
7. 🎯 This attack did not mark the total control of Nelliaddy by the LTTE, but it was their biggest victory at that time.
8. 🕵️‍♂️ This marked the inception of the 'Black Tigers,' a suicide bombing squad within the LTTE. Black Tigers were used against military targets and controversial civilian targets. 
9. 👥 Black tigers were volunteers and were honored by being granted an audience with the LTTE leader, Veluppillai Prabakaran, before their missions.
10. 🤔 While religion was not a motivator, the promise of a separate Tamil country and the sense of self-sacrifice drove the Black Tigers.
