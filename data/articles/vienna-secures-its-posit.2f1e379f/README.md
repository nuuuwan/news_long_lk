## Summary ðŸ¤–

Facts: 
- The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s (EIU) Global Liveability Index has ranked Vienna as the most liveable city in the world for the third consecutive year.
- The index evaluates 173 cities globally across five categories: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure.
- Western Europe continues to hold the title for the most liveable region in the world, with Copenhagen, Zurich, and Geneva among the top ten. The region, however, saw the largest dip in scores due to a deterioration in stability.
- Four cities from the Asia-Pacific made it to the top ten: Melbourne and Sydney (Australia), Osaka (Japan) and Auckland (New Zealand). Australia's overall infrastructure scores were however downgraded due to an ongoing housing crisis.
- Tel Aviv declined by 20 places owing to Israel's conflict with Hamas impacting the region's stability. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries on the other hand saw improvements in education and healthcare.
- A severe housing crisis caused a drop in infrastructure scores for Canada, with Toronto falling out of the top ten to the 12th position.
- The largest US cities, Los Angeles and New York, are ranked 58th and 70th respectively, but all 25 US cities in the index retain a liveability score above 80. 

Opinions: 
- The rise in average scores due to improvements in healthcare and education in developing countries is considered positive, despite being offset by declines in scores for some top-tier cities. 
- Despite improvements in liveability scores in the GCC countries, the Middle East and North Africa region is still home to the least liveable cities, including Algiers (Algeria), Tripoli (Libya) and Damascus (Syria).
- Despite the fall in rankings for Toronto, North America is still considered to have a high liveability level with the region boasting high average education scores and competitive infrastructure and culture when compared to Western Europe.
- Evaluating living conditions and understanding lifestyle challenges is considered crucial in shaping strategies and informing policies for businesses, governments, and academic institutions.

Vienna secures its position as the worldâ€™s most liveable city for third consecutive year

LiveabilityGlobalLiveability Ranking and OverviewConsumer

Vienna has been named the worldâ€™s most liveable city for the third year running, according to the results of EIUâ€™s latest annual Global Liveability Index. The index ranks the liveability of 173 cities across five key categories, including stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. This yearâ€™s survey saw a rise in average scores, driven by gains in healthcare and education across developing countries, although this has been largely offset by declines in scores for several top-tier cities.

Western Europe has retained its position as the most liveable region in the world, with Copenhagen, Zurich and Geneva once again making it to the top ten. The 30 western European cities in this yearâ€™s ranking reported an impressive average score of 92 out of 100. However, the region has seen the biggest fall in score, owing to a deterioration in the stability category, which was also the biggest declining factor in all five categories in the index globally.

Four Asia-Pacific citiesâ€”Melbourne and Sydney (Australia), Osaka (Japan) and Auckland (New Zealand) are among this yearâ€™s top ten most liveable cities in the world. The Australasian cities continue to rank within the top 20. This time, however, we have downgraded overall infrastructure scores for Australia, owing to an ongoing housing crisis that has led to an all-time low availability of rental properties in many of the cities.

Cities in the Middle East and North Africa present a mixed bag. Israelâ€™s conflict with Hamas has led to Tel Aviv being the biggest faller down the ranks, dropping by 20 places to the 112th place. While the conflict has dealt a blow to the regionâ€™s stability scores, strong gains in education and healthcare in many of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have pushed up the regionâ€™s overall liveability. The biggest increase in scores was registered by the cities in the UAE (Abu Dhabi, Dubai) and Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar). Despite improvements, the region is also home to the least liveable citiesâ€”Algiers (Algeria), Tripoli (Libya) and Damascus (Syria).

An acute housing crisis has pulled down infrastructure scores for Canada, with Toronto registering the biggest decline among the Canadian cities, and dropping out of our list of the top ten most liveable cities to the 12th position, leaving Calgary and Vancouver as the only two North American cities in the top ten. Meanwhile, the largest US cities, notably Los Angeles and New York, are ranked at 58th and 70th respectively. However, all 25 of the regionâ€™s cities in the index continue to attain the highest tier of liveability (above 80). The region boasts a world-leading average education score and compares favourably with western Europe in terms of infrastructure and culture.
