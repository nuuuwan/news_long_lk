    "It\u2019s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-\u00adconditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat\u2014no additional energy required. \u201cRadiative cooling is universal\u2014it exists everywhere in our daily life,\u201d says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It\u2019s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says\u2014their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That\u2019s how you get dew.  Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed \u201ccool roofs\u201d capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. \u201cPeople have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,\u201d says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative\u00adcooling startup SkyCool Systems. Related StoryIn defense of air-conditioningRead nextModern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan\u2019s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can\u2019t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers\u2014a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an \u201catmospheric window,\u201d because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9\u00a0\u00b0F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.",
    "That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they\u2019re more durable and scalable. Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.",
    "This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. \u201cThis is personal thermal management,\u201d says Gan. \u201cWe can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.\u201d\u00a0  A thermal image captured during a SkyCool installation shows treated areas (white, yellow) that are roughly 35 \u00baC cooler than the surrounding rooftop.COURTESY OF SKYCOOL SYSTEMS   Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they\u2019re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials\u2019 bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that don\u2019t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. \u201cThey are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,\u201d says Raman. \u201cSo for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?\u201d As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won\u2019t fit all. \u201cWe cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,\u201d Gan says. \u201cWe still need more efficient active air-conditioning.\u201d A shiny roof isn\u2019t a panacea, but it\u2019s still pretty cool.\u00a0 Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York and author of First Contact: The Story of Our Obsession with Aliens. hide"
