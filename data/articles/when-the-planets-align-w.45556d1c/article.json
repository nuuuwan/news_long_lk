    "In the skies over the world around our planet yesterday, a rare phenomenon galvanised professional star-gazers to set up their telescopes for a scintillating celestial show. It was a configuration of all seven planets in our solar system \u2018on the same side of the sun above our heads\u2019 that last took place decades ago, and won\u2019t recur until 2040.",
    "For astronomy buffs, it was literally the event of a lifetime \u2013 while the more spiritually minded appealed to the esoteric value of the solar systemic alignment; suggesting \u2018higher energies\u2019, fostering \u2018a sense of unity\u2019 and spurring \u2018collective growth\u2019.",
    "Near to the earth \u2013 at ground level where politics operates \u2013 there has been a similar sense of renewed dynamism, a unifying bonhomie (bar some critics in chamber and cocktail circuit) and camaraderie around an inkling that our country was on the cusp of a sea-change.",
    "A new planet had swum into our ken \u2013 as the poet would have it then \u2013 and now, it seemed the political stars were aligned for something rich and strange in nation, state, country, civics and governance.",
    "It is a great pity, then, and nothing short of a show spoiler for the starry-eyed, that the prematurely brash critics of the JVP-led NPP government may be proving to be right, at least in some respects \u2013 although to be fair by the newbie regime, it may still be too early to draw damning conclusions about their performance (or as the carps and cavils have it, a lack thereof).",
    "Early fizz and sparkle",
    "For starters, the early fizz and sparkle of a promising government has had it Bayeux tapestries (with shining comets portending clean sweeps of the business of politics as much as the politics of business) a tad sullied by a perplexing inertia when it comes to practically implementing a raft of its campaign-trail promises of only a few moons ago.",
    "What price concrete constitutional steps being taken with a view to abolishing the odious and onerous executive presidency, hanging like the proverbial albatross around successive chief executives\u2019 heads?",
    "Where have the long-awaited and closely-watched investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks of 2019 (to say nothing of emblematic assassinations of iconic editors that stand as symbols of a plethora of other abuses of power ending in death and disappearances of so many professionals as much as ordinary citizens) led us \u2013 save to shame-faced admission by the powers that be about it being harder to prosecute than they fondly imagined once upon a time... which is precisely how so many fairy-tales start off \u2013 well!",
    "More than portents, the powers that be now need to present expeditiously a proof to their electorate that that starry-eyed hope wasn\u2019t entirely misplaced",
    "How much longer beyond this extended honeymoon period for a tyro government does an impatient polity have to wait for the axe to fall on the corrupt, the crooked, and the criminal cabals of previous culprit regimes that never seem to end as far as impunity went... and it went quite a distance under successive previous dispensations? Is it acceptable to more than nonpartisan neoliberals that the NPP\u2019s maiden Budget smacks more of the Grand Old Party (UNP) than the Grand Old Man (Marx)? Or that it is the many-times fallen poor (COVID-19, economic crisis) who once again will be asked to walk the wire without a safety net?",
    "Conspiracy side of things",
    "Then again, there is the conspiracy side of things \u2013 which no less than President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has invited the polity as much as the police and security forces to scrutinise.",
    "Is there a plot \u2013 or a diabolical concatenation of circumstantial evidence \u2013 to bolster the theory that the rice and coconut crises that threatened to undermine the government\u2019s credibility and stability in the same breath were the handiwork of politically affiliated economic hit-men and associated mafias?",
    "And is the recent spate of \u2018encounter killings\u2019 of criminals in police custody \u2013 while still not tantamount to a national security threat \u2013 a scurrilous ploy to portend to the public that their ostensibly law-abiding and high-on-order administration is no different from other draconian regimes?",
    "Be all of these portents as they may, there are still champions of the incumbent government \u2013 and articulate representatives of the regime in the JVP politburo \u2013 who would charmingly claim that the writing in the stars still favours a sea-change for Sri Lanka into something rich and not so strange.",
    "That implementing even solid policies takes a certain amount of time, and that the medium rather than the short term would prove the bona fides of politburo, parliament, cabinet and the whole kit and caboodle of them.",
    "But as much as the grand celestial show in the skies above Sri Lanka yesterday will sooner than later fade, so will the goodwill and confident trust of the people at large evaporate like the dawn mist that heralded the planetary conjunction \u2013 if government doesn\u2019t get its alignment right, and soon at that.",
    "And more than portents, the powers that be now need to present expeditiously a proof to their electorate that that starry-eyed hope wasn\u2019t entirely misplaced.",
