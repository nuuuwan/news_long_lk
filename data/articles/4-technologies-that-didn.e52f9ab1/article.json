    "If you\u2019re a longtime reader, you probably know that our newsroom selects 10 breakthroughs every year that we think will define the future. This group exercise is mostly fun and always engrossing, but at times it can also be quite difficult.\u00a0 We collectively pitch dozens of ideas, and the editors meticulously review and debate the merits of each. We agonize over which ones might make the broadest impact, whether one is too similar to something we\u2019ve featured in the past, and how confident we are that a recent advance will actually translate into long-term success. There is plenty of lively discussion along the way.\u00a0\u00a0  The 2026 list will come out on January 12\u2014so stay tuned. In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the technologies from this year\u2019s reject pile, as a window into our decision-making process.\u00a0 These four technologies won\u2019t be on our 2026 list of breakthroughs, but all were closely considered, and we think they\u2019re worth knowing about.",
    "Male contraceptives\u00a0 There are several new treatments in the pipeline for men who are sexually active and wish to prevent pregnancy\u2014potentially providing them with an alternative to condoms or vasectomies.\u00a0 Two of those treatments are now being tested in clinical trials by a company called Contraline. One is a gel that men would rub on their shoulder or upper arm once a day to suppress sperm production, and the other is a device designed to block sperm during ejaculation. (Kevin Eisenfrats, Contraline\u2019s CEO, was recently named to our Innovators Under 35 list). A once-a-day pill is also in early-stage trials with the firm YourChoice Therapeutics.",
    "Though it\u2019s exciting to see this progress, it will still take several years for any of these treatments to make their way through clinical trials\u2014assuming all goes well. World models\u00a0 World models have become the hot new thing in AI in recent months. Though they\u2019re difficult to define, these models are generally trained on videos or spatial data and aim to produce 3D virtual worlds from simple prompts. They reflect fundamental principles, like gravity, that govern our actual world. The results could be used in game design or to make robots more capable by helping them understand their physical surroundings.\u00a0 Despite some disagreements on exactly what constitutes a world model, the idea is certainly gaining momentum. Renowned AI researchers including Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li have launched companies to develop them, and Li\u2019s startup World Labs released its first version last month. And Google made a huge splash with the release of its Genie 3 world model earlier this year.\u00a0 Though these models are shaping up to be an exciting new frontier for AI in the year ahead, it seemed premature to deem them a breakthrough. But definitely watch this space.\u00a0  Proof of personhood\u00a0 Thanks to AI, it\u2019s getting harder to know who and what is real online. It\u2019s now possible to make hyperrealistic digital avatars of yourself or someone you know based on very little training data, using equipment many people have at home. And AI agents are being set loose across the internet to take action on people\u2019s behalf.\u00a0 All of this is creating more interest in what are known as personhood credentials, which could offer a way to verify that you are, in fact, a real human when you do something important online.\u00a0 For example, we\u2019ve reported on efforts by OpenAI, Microsoft, Harvard, and MIT to create a digital token that would serve this purpose. To get it, you\u2019d first go to a government office or other organization and show identification. Then it\u2019d be installed on your device and whenever you wanted to, say, log into your bank account, cryptographic protocols would verify that the token was authentic\u2014confirming that you are the person you claim to be.\u00a0 Related StoryMeet the man building a starter kit for civilizationRead nextWhether or not this particular approach catches on, many of us in the newsroom agree that the future internet will need something along these lines. Right now, though, many competing identity verification projects are in various stages of development. One is World ID by Sam Altman\u2019s startup Tools for Humanity, which uses a twist on biometrics.",
    "If these efforts reach critical mass\u2014or if one emerges as the clear winner, perhaps by becoming a universal standard or being integrated into a major platform\u2014we\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to revisit the idea.\u00a0\u00a0 The world\u2019s oldest baby In July, senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou broke the news of a record-setting baby. The infant developed from an embryo that had been sitting in storage for more than 30 years, earning him the bizarre honorific of \u201coldest baby.\u201d\u00a0 This odd new record was made possible in part by advances in IVF, including safer methods of thawing frozen embryos. But perhaps the greater enabler has been the rise of \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agencies that pair donors with hopeful parents. People who work with these agencies are sometimes more willing to make use of decades-old embryos.\u00a0 This practice could help find a home for some of the millions of leftover embryos that remain frozen in storage banks today. But since this recent achievement was brought about by changing norms as much as by any sudden technological improvements, this record didn\u2019t quite meet our definition of a breakthrough\u2014though it\u2019s impressive nonetheless. hide"
