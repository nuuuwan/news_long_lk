The late Arumugan Thondaman, a former Cabinet Minister, Nuwara Eliya district Parliamentarian and leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), would have turned 60 on 29 May. Thondaman died four days prior to his 56th birthday in 2020 from a cardiac arrest and was serving as a Minister in the cabinet of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Thondaman's political life saw him elected to Parliament from the Nuwara Eliya district and he eventually became the CWC leader and cabinet minister. His actions led to upheaval within the CWC and in the Tamil-based hill country politics but he managed to consolidate his position despite resistance.
