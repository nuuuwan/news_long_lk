A viral video depicting a head transplant machine known as BrainBridge is not promoting a real company or product, but rather a concept in extreme life extension. This concept has been gaining attention among life-extension proponents and entrepreneurs. The video was created by Hashem Al-Ghaili, a Yemeni science communicator and filmmaker, and was partially funded by Alex Zhavoronkov, the founder of Insilico Medicine. Al-Ghaili says that the goal of the video is to push boundaries and test feasibility, rather than just to generate clicks or attention. The concept of head transplantation is viewed by some biohackers and technologists as a potential avenue for radical life extension, although there remain many technical and ethical challenges, as well as considerable public opposition.
