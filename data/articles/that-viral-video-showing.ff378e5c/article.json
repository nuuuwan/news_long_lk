    "An animated video posted this week has a voice-over that sounds like a late-night TV ad, but the pitch is straight out of the far future. The arms of an octopus-like robotic surgeon swirl, swiftly removing the head of a dying man and placing it onto a young, healthy body.\u00a0 This is BrainBridge, the animated video claims\u2014\u201cthe world\u2019s first revolutionary concept for a head transplant machine, which uses state-of-the-art robotics and artificial intelligence to conduct complete head and face transplantation.\u201d  First posted on Tuesday, the video has millions of views, more than 24,000 comments on Facebook, and a content warning on TikTok for its grisly depictions of severed heads. A slick BrainBridge website has several job postings, including one for a \u201cneuroscience team leader\u201d and another for a \u201cgovernment relations adviser.\u201d It is all convincing enough for the New York Post to announce that BrainBridge is \u201ca biomedical engineering startup\u201d and that \u201cthe company\u201d plans a surgery within eight years.\u00a0 We can report that BrainBridge is not a real company\u2014it\u2019s not incorporated anywhere. The video was made by Hashem Al-Ghaili, a Yemeni science communicator and film director who in 2022 made a viral video called \u201cEctoLife,\u201d about artificial wombs, that also left journalists scrambling to determine if it was real or not.",
    "Yet BrainBridge is not merely a provocative work of art. This video is better understood as a public billboard for a hugely controversial scheme to defeat death that\u2019s recently been gaining attention among some life-extension proponents and entrepreneurs.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s about recruiting newcomers to join the project,\u201d says Al-Ghaili.",
    "This morning, Al-Ghaili, who lives in Dubai, was up at 5 a.m., tracking the video as its viewership ballooned around social media. \u201cI am monitoring its progress,\u201d he says, but he insists he didn\u2019t make the film for clicks: \u201cBeing viral is not the goal. I can be viral anytime. It\u2019s pushing boundaries and testing feasibility.\u201d The video project was bankrolled in part by Alex Zhavoronkov, the founder of Insilico Medicine, a large AI drug discovery company, who is also a prominent figure in anti-aging research. After Zhavoronkov posted the video on his LinkedIn account, commenters noticed that it is his face on the two bodies shown in the video. \u201cI can confirm I helped design and fund a few things,\u201d Zhavoronkov told MIT Technology Review in a WhatsApp message, in which he also claimed that \u201csome important and famous people are supporting [it] financially.\u201d Zhavoronkov declined to name these individuals. He also didn\u2019t respond when asked if the job ads\u2014whose cookie-cutter descriptions of qualifications and responsibilities appear to have been written by an AI\u2014are real roles or make-believe positions.  Aging bypass What is certain is that head transplantation\u2014or body transplant, as some prefer to call it\u2014is a subject of growing, if speculative, interest in longevity circles, the kind inhabited by biohackers, techno-anarchists, and others on the fringes of biotechnology and the startup scene and who form the most dedicated cadre of extreme life-extensionists. Many proponents of longer life spans will admit things don\u2019t look good. Anti-aging medicine so far hasn\u2019t achieved any breakthroughs. In fact, as research advances into the molecular details, the problem of death only looks more and more complicated. As we age, our billions of cells gradually succumb to the irreversible effects of entropy. Fixing that may never be possible. By comparison, putting your head on a young body looks comparatively easy\u2014a way to bypass aging in a single stroke, at least as long as your brain holds out. The idea was strongly endorsed in a technical road map put forward this year by the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, a group espousing radical life extension, which rated \u201cbody replacement\u201d as the cheapest, fastest pathway to \u201csolve aging.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Will head transplants work? In a crude way, they already have. In the early 1970s, the American neurosurgeon Robert White performed a \u201ccephalic exchange,\u201d cutting off the head of a monkey, placing it on the body of another, and sewing together their circulatory systems. Reports suggest the head remained conscious, and able to see, for a few days before it died.",
    "Most likely, a human head transplant would also be fatal. But even if you lived, you\u2019d be a mind atop a paralyzed body, since exchanging heads means severing the spinal cord.\u00a0 Yet head-swapping proponents can point to plausible solutions for that, too\u2014a number of which appear in the BrainBridge video. In Europe, for instance, some paralyzed people have walked again after doctors bridged their spinal injuries with electronics. Other scientists in China are studying growth factors to regrow nerves. Joined at the neck As shocking as the video is, BrainBridge is in some ways overly conventional in its thinking. If you want to keep your brain going, why must it be on a human body? You might instead keep the head alive on a heart-lung machine\u2014with an Elon Musk neural implant to let it surf the internet, for as long as it lives. Or consider how doctors hoping to solve the organ shortage have started putting hearts and kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into patients. If you don\u2019t mind having a tail and four legs, maybe your head could be placed onto a pig\u2019s body. Let\u2019s take it a step further. Why does the body \u201cdonor\u201d have to be dead at all? Anatomically, it\u2019s possible to have two heads. There are conjoined twins who share one body. If your spouse were diagnosed with a fatal cancer, you would surely welcome his or her head next to yours, if it allowed their mind to live on. After all, the concept of a \"living donor\" is widely accepted in transplant medicine already, and married couples are often said to be joined at the hip. Why not at the neck, too? If the video is an attempt to take the public\u2019s temperature and gauge reactions, it\u2019s been successful. Since it was posted, thousands of commenters have explored the moral dilemmas posed by the procedure. For instance, if someone is left brain dead\u2014say, in a motorcycle accident\u2014surgeons can use their heart, liver, and kidneys to save multiple other people. Would it be ethical to use a body to help only one person? \u201cThe most common question is \u2018Where do you get the bodies from?\u2019\u201d says Al-Ghaili. The BrainBridge website answers this question by stating it will source \u201cethically grown\u201d unconscious bodies from EctoLife, the artificial womb company that is Al-Ghaili\u2019s previous fiction. He also suggests that people undergoing euthanasia because of chronic pain, or even psychiatric problems, could provide an additional supply.\u00a0 For the most part, the public seems to hate the idea. On Facebook, a pastor, Matthew. W. Tucker, called the concept \u201cdisgusting, immoral, unnecessary, pagan, demonic and outright idiotic,\u201d adding that \u201cthey have no idea what they are doing.\u201d A poster from the Middle East apologized for the video, joking that its creator \u201cis one of our psychiatric patients who escaped last night.\u201d \u201cWe urge the public to go about [their] business as everything is under control,\u201d this person said. Al-Ghaili is monitoring the feedback with interest and some concern. \u201cThe negativity is huge, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cBut behind that are the ones who are sending emails. These are people who want to invest, or who are expressing their personal health challenges. These are the ones who matter.\u201d He says if suitable job applicants appear, the backers of BrainBridge are prepared to fund a small technical feasibility study to see if their idea has legs. hide"
