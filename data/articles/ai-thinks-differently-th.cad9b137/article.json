    "Generative AI isn\u2019t the strategic oracle many say it is. Like any other form of AI, it is a mirror that reflects patterns, trends, and decisions of the past. It cannot reliably break new ground or generate truly novel solutions given that it relies on pre-existing data and...more",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force reshaping business landscapes across industries. While generative AI represents the latest breakthrough in this realm of technological innovation, it stands apart by fundamentally challenging traditional strategic decision-making paradigms. Unlike its predecessors, this technology offers unprecedented capabilities in language processing and content generation, enabling organizations to synthesize complex information, generate nuanced insights, and accelerate decision-making with remarkable precision and depth.",
    "Yet there\u2019s a critical misconception embedded in this vision: Generative AI simply isn\u2019t the strategic oracle many say it is. Like any other AI, it is a mirror that reflects patterns, trends, and decisions of the past. To effectively employ any AI in strategic decision-making, it is vitally important for managers and leaders to understand the limitations that are inherent in the way it generates output.",
    "AI is exceptional at recognizing established patterns and streamlining processes based on historical data. This is where it has made its mark on business decisions. It can support loan decisions by predicting default risks with a high degree of accuracy; prevent machine breakdown by initiating equipment maintenance before failures occur; optimize supply chain decisions by adapting rapidly to changing circumstances; and summarize content from documents with ease. Generative AI adds more capabilities to this growing list: Recent studies, for example, show that AI can already generate and evaluate business plans at a level equivalent to humans.",
    "Given the advances of AI, prominent advocates \u2014 including the late Daniel Kahneman \u2014 have even argued that humans should be replaced with algorithms where possible. There is, however, a flaw in this logic. No matter how capable AI may have become, it cannot reliably break new ground or generate truly novel solutions given that it relies on pre-existing data and learned probabilities.",
    "This applies to generative AI as well. Its output is based on learned correlations from past data. In essence, its response to any given prompt is a prediction based on stochastic patterns the AI has seen in its training data. With lots of data to train on, this works remarkably well. But this also gives rise to well-documented issues such as hallucination, prompt instability, and knowledge cut-off problems.",
    "Think about asking generative AI to set a company\u2019s strategic direction. It will, by default, replicate what it has seen in its training data and recite well-established features it has learned. One can also see this effect experimentally. If one trains generative AI systems recursively on its own output, its prediction will collapse within a few generations. The reason is that it will reinforce predictions from the center of respective distributions it has learned \u2014 to the point where its output becomes nonsensical altogether. Even more concerning, if one adds additional prose that is obviously irrelevant to the original prompt, its prediction will still degrade considerably as it is unable to discern which information in the prompt is actually relevant.",
    "AI systems may be very fluent, yet they are neither able to understand context nor can they reason. Their insights are based on correlations alone. As we discuss in a recent paper, humans have a key advantage: We can develop novel intuitions or theories and test them in the real world. This is crucially important for strategic decision-making. The best strategies often \u201cgo against the flow\u201d of conventional wisdom. Firms like Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Spotify, Tesla, or Airbnb all succeeded by challenging \u2014 not reinforcing \u2014 established patterns in their respective markets. An AI can parrot back what has worked in the past based on its training data. But it does not have any way of looking forward. To offer a historical example, if a hypothetical AI system at the time of the Wright brothers were asked about the plausibility of human heavier-than-air flight, it would have merely reflected the scientific consensus at the time that considered this form of flight to be impossible. The forward-looking reasoning and problem solving of the Wright brothers enabled them to make the unpredictable a reality.",
    "While AI has its limits, it can, however, be harnessed by humans in powerful ways. By using AI\u2019s computational prowess to augment human judgment, rather than replace it, organizations can capitalize on its strengths while still relying on human intuition, creativity, and causal reasoning to innovate and lead in uncharted territories. We have identified three ways leaders can leverage generative AI effectively to support forward-looking decision-making that steer organizations toward growth and innovation.",
    "1. As a Sounding Board",
    "A key feature of generative AI is its ability to produce detailed content in response to simple instructions, or prompts. Prompts can be engineered to have the AI adopt different persona, such as customer segments, allowing for the use of the AI as a sounding board for ideas. An AI can be prompted to answer queries from various angles or points of view, without being constrained by scope or money. What previously required costly and lengthy customer focus groups and consulting projects can now be investigated by deliberate prompting. The AI system becomes, in effect, a new member of the team \u2014 capable of advising on likely responses to given questions. By deliberately altering the prompts and personas, it is possible to use the AI to generate a wide range of likely responses or outcomes \u2014 in a way that previously incurred considerable time and cost.",
    "But because of the inherent limitations in how AI generates content, leaders should use its insights as a basis to question established practices rather than to validate them blindly. AI can be a strategy sounding board to explore, challenge and expand, but it must not become an echo chamber that confirms what is already known.",
    "2. To Explore Scenarios",
    "When faced with a specific set of strategic options, a generative AI system can help define what the potential outcomes for each might be. Commanding it to adopt a given scenario allows for a structured investigation into \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. The scenarios could be typical predictive scenarios that use current knowledge to estimate probable future situations. Given the comprehensive knowledge embedded in generative AI\u2019s training data, they can also include exploratory scenarios that use trends of the present to estimate the plausible continuation of these trends in the future and normative scenarios that sketch out a particular vision of the future, and ways to get there.",
    "However, rather than viewing AI as a definitive authority, decision-makers should treat its outputs as provisional insights that allow them to identify emerging patterns that challenge conventional thinking. They should probe for what might be missing or misrepresented.",

    "Collaborating with AI",
    "How humans and machines can best work together.",
    "Since generative AI systems perform better on smaller, narrowly defined tasks, when exploring complex questions \u2014 the kind that are inherent to the creation of a strategy \u2014 it is best to break up scenarios of interest into smaller components and to generate answers for each aspect, before combining these into one solution.",
    "3. As an Ideation Tool",
    "The creation of new content \u2014 text, images, videos, and sound \u2014 has become the hallmark of the generative AI revolution. AI has two advantages here: It can generate content quickly and at little cost, and it can combine modalities, such as using text prompts to generate images or videos. This unique ability makes it a great tool to screen new ideas and to support the product development process. In essence, generative AI tools provide the ability to be a digital sketch board that transcends all modalities: text, images, video and sound.",
    "One point to remember is that AI can generate content at a high rate. Human capacity for vetting this content, however, is limited. So, more is not always better. Rather than generating a recurring set of random outputs, it is best to be directive and choose specific aspects of avenues to explore. Not unlike the process of identifying potential active compounds in drug discovery, the trick is to start with a wide set of options and then to narrow it down quickly by eliminating candidate molecules.",
    "Moving Forward: Positioning AI as a Strategic Complement",
    "For generative AI to be a valuable part of forward-looking decision-making and strategy, senior managers must view it as a powerful complement to human cognition. It is well-suited to provide pattern-based insights and generate new content. However, no matter how capable future AI becomes, human strengths \u2014 especially in causal reasoning and forward-looking decision-making \u2014 will remain essential for navigating uncertainty and inventing the future. The underlying mechanism of any AI system is prediction, which enables it to excel at identifying past or existing trends. Yet it is ultimately up to humans to envision entirely new directions and set strategic goals that lie beyond the boundaries of known data.",
