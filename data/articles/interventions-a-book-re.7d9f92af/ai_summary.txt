The anthology “Interventions” features selected political writings from Dayan Jayatilleka and has been edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya. Jayatilleka, a public intellectual, turned underground activist during Sri Lanka's troubled years spanning 1977-1989. His writings have been appreciated by new generation thinkers who were born long after that period. As a brilliant ambassador in Geneva, Paris, and Moscow following his activist years, Jayatilleka remained a combative voice holding politicians and institutions accountable, as reflected in the anthology. The book serves a historical purpose and offers insights into Marxism and Jayatilleka's stance on it.
