    "Education reforms have become a major topic of national debate. Unfortunately, its strategic importance has been undermined by covert \u201cpolitical\u201d agendas, short-term \u201cquick fixes,\u201d \u201cuntested solutions\u201d, and the narrow outlook of policymakers. In the past, reforms to the education system have often been driven by political motives rather than by the future needs of the local and global contexts. Moreover, extremist left-wing parties have repeatedly disrupted meaningful reform efforts\u2014particularly in the tertiary sector, deterring the opportunities for young people in realising their potential.",
    "The fundamental objective of any reform is to bring improvement and to prepare a society for the future. Education is essentially a process of socialisation that begins within the family\u2014most notably with parents, especially the mother, who traditionally serves as a child\u2019s first \u201cHuman Resources Manager.\u201d The extended family also plays a significant role in nurturing children and, in many cases, continues to offer guidance as those children grow into parenthood themselves. Upbringing is therefore central and strategic to an individual\u2019s development, as it establishes the foundation for Primary education, followed by Secondary education, which paves the path to tertiary education and the world.",
    "Education must be understood as a \u2018transformational process\u2019 that shapes an individual across three behavioral dimensions; Attitude, Skills, and Knowledge.",
    "Education reforms should first acknowledge the fundamental fabric of the society, the civic foundations of education, preservation of cultural, familial, and community values, before any step is undertaken. It is inherently risky to revive policies that were previously abandoned or to adopt modified models borrowed from foreign cultures\u2014whether more advanced or less developed\u2014without careful contextual adaptation. The irresistible enthusiasm for digitising every aspect of education is also impractical, as society requires many competencies that cannot be fully or even partially converted into digital formats.",
    "The family, the place of worship and the school form a natural and practical model. The family plays a strategically vital role, followed by places of worship\u2014regardless of religion, and transformed by educational institutions. These elements have formed the greater foundations of civilisations, since the beginning of human civilisations and continuity.",
    "In reforming, first the \u2018reformists\u2019 must understand the gaps between the futuristic needs and the existing system of the educating process, in relation to the \u2018value system of Sri Lanka\u2019. The \u2018value system\u2019 of Sri Lanka is well-established on three platforms; family, religion and schools, which continue to construct and sustain the \u2018culture\u2019 of this country. In some extremes, the \u2018social-strata\u2019 plays an unavoidable role.",
    "Policymakers/planners cannot afford to be too dogmatic or purely academic in their approach. Parents too cannot seek a \u201cconvenient path\u201d to their children\u2019s educational progress by imagining the removal of continuous assessments, examinations, and periodic evaluations, which some of them perceive as \u2018tiresome or difficult\u2019, due to their \u2018preoccupied\u2019 lifestyles. Today, it is an open secret that many parents\u2014especially mothers\u2014complete homework on behalf of their children, while a large number of teenagers rely on \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d practices to save time and avoid poor grades. Some of these children will be helpless whenever they are \u2018grounded\u2019 on their own with harsh realities. Empowering is a key deliverable in education.",
    "Policymakers/planners cannot afford to be too dogmatic or purely academic in their approach. Parents too cannot seek a \u201cconvenient path\u201d to their children\u2019s educational progress by imagining the removal of continuous assessments, examinations, and periodic evaluations, which some of them perceive as \u2018tiresome or difficult\u2019, due to their \u2018preoccupied\u2019 life styles",
    "Radical disruption of an established value system can become a \u201cticking-time bomb,\u201d which may destabilise the society, might damage the cultural fabric. Therefore, any \u2018transformational changes\u2019 envisioned for 2030 must begin with carefully planned \u2018incremental reforms\u2019, provisioning sufficient time for \u2018cultivation\u2019, \u2018adaptation\u2019, and \u2018consolidation\u2019.",
    "Such reforms should be initiated with the leadership of key facilitators\u2014local teachers, educationists, religious leaders, and heads of schools across national, provincial, private, or international. The objective is to enable the exchange of expertise and experience, optimum use of talent and encouraging the sharing of best practices across the education system.",
    "\u2018Reforms\u2019 are essential to introduce new knowledge and skills while shaping the attitudes that preserve cultural and family roots. Consider a practical example: today, many employers struggle to find candidates who can work competently in the English language.",
    "Addressing this gap requires making \u2018English-medium instruction\u2019 available (permanent basis) in all schools from Grade 6 onwards, while strengthening the schools that already offer \u2018English-medium education\u2019. However, before implementing such an initiative, it must be preceded by the development of a new generation of facilitators and the continuous upskilling of existing ones, in a \u2018manageable\u2019 management structure.",
    "Strong pool of English teachers",
    "Sri Lanka once had an exceptionally strong pool of English teachers during the 1960s and 1970s, many of whom left the country due to broader national challenges. Over time, left-wing movements and National policies portrayed English as an instrument of imperialism rather than presenting it as a vital gateway to global knowledge and opportunities.",
    "A wide range of competencies are demanded in the commercial world today.",
    "The advantage of \u2018Vocational studies\u2019 must be used to build a foundation for future-oriented skills and to enhance an individual\u2019s value in terms of both skills and knowledge, while continuing the fundamental subjects such as History, Art, Nature, Health. Fields such as automobile engineering\u2014beginning with basic mechanical skills\u2014domestic, commercial, and industrial electrical work, electronics, programming, elementary law and regulatory studies, taxation, aluminum, iron and steel fabrication, designing, sports are strong examples of this approach. For example, before teaching AI, one must learn to use simple applications which help in work and personal life. It is just as simple as learning to \u2018walk\u2019 before \u2018running\u2019.",
    "Government and the people must ensure that education remains \u2018purposeful\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 from political or vested interests, in order to build a \u2018stable\u2019, \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018resourceful\u2019 society and a \u2018cultured\u2019 country",
    "International experiences further highlight the importance of early skill development. In China, children are introduced to logical thinking and basic programming concepts as early as three to four years of age through foundational games. According to sources, from September 2025, AI education has become mandatory nationwide for children starting at age six. China\u2019s basic education system consists of preschool education (usually three years), primary education (six years, beginning at around age six), and secondary education (six years), reflecting a long-term, structured approach to skill and knowledge development.",
    "The significance of sex education has recently drawn considerable attention, often accompanied by concerns due to unwarranted publicity on \u2018choices\u2019 that may conflict with the existing societal values. In the 1980s and 1990s, sex education was carefully integrated in secondary education, focusing on specific age levels. Explicit materials that could exploit teens and youth were strictly prohibited at that time on age limits, and religious institutions played a significant role in guiding adults towards responsible and civilised intimate life. We should be well-aware that \u2018individual sexuality\u2019 is a private matter and should remain personal, where education should serve to create awareness and inculcate civility rather than influencing personal choices.",
    "Government and the people must ensure that education remains \u2018purposeful\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 from political or vested interests, in order to build a \u2018stable\u2019, \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018resourceful\u2019 society and a \u2018cultured\u2019 country.",
