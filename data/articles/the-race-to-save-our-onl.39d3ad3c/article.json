    "There is a photo of my daughter that I love. She is sitting, smiling, in our old back garden, chubby hands grabbing at the cool grass. It was taken in 2013, when she was almost one, on an aging Samsung digital camera. I originally stored it on a laptop before transferring it to a chunky external hard drive. A few years later, I uploaded it to Google Photos. When I search for the word \u201dgrass,\u201d Google\u2019s algorithm pulls it up. It always makes me smile.  I pay Google \u00a31.79 a month to keep my memories safe. That\u2019s a lot of trust I\u2019m putting in a company that\u2019s existed for only 26 years. But the hassle it removes seems worth it. There\u2019s just so much stuff nowadays. The admin required to keep it updated and stored safely is just too onerous. My parents didn\u2019t have this problem. They took occasional photos of me on a film camera and periodically printed them out on paper and put them in a photo album. These pictures are still viewable now, 40-odd years later, on faded yellowing photo paper\u2014a few frames per year.",
    "Many of my memories from the following decades are also fixed on paper. The letters I received from my friends when traveling abroad in my 20s were handwritten on lined paper. I still have them crammed in a shoebox, an amusing\u00a0but relatively small archive of an offline time. We no longer have such space limitations. My iPhone takes thousands of photos a year. Our Instagram and TikTok feeds are constantly updated. We collectively send billions of WhatsApp messages and texts and emails and tweets.",
    "But while all this data is plentiful, it\u2019s also more ephemeral. One day in the maybe-not-so-distant future, YouTube won\u2019t exist and its videos may be lost forever. Facebook\u2014and your uncle\u2019s holiday posts\u2014will vanish. There is precedent for this. MySpace, the first largish-scale social network, deleted every photo, video, and audio file uploaded to it before 2016, seemingly inadvertently. Entire tranches of Usenet newsgroups, home to some of the internet\u2019s earliest conversations, have gone offline forever and vanished from history. And in June this year, more than 20 years of music journalism disappeared when the MTV News archives were taken offline. For many archivists, alarm bells are ringing. Across the world, they are scraping up defunct websites or at-risk data collections to save as much of our digital lives as possible. Others are working on ways to store that data in formats that will last hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years.\u00a0 The endeavor raises complex questions. What is important to us? How and why do we decide what to keep\u2014and what do we let go?\u00a0 And how will future generations make sense of what we\u2019re able to save?  \u201cWelcome to the challenge of every historian, archaeologist, novelist,\u201d says Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist. \u201cHow do you make sense of what\u2019s left? And then how do you avoid reading it through the lens of the now?\u201d Last-chance saloon There is more stuff being created now than at any time in history. At Google\u2019s I/O conference this year, the firm\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said that 6 billion photos and videos are uploaded to Google Photos every day. More than 40 million WhatsApp messages are sent every minute.

    "Even with so much more of it, though, our data is more fragile than ever. Books could burn in a freak library fire, but data is much easier to wipe forever. We\u2019ve seen it happen\u2014not only in incidents like the accidental deletion of MySpace data but also, sometimes, with intent.\u00a0 In 2009, Yahoo announced it was going to pull the plug on the web-hosting platform GeoCities, putting millions of carefully created web pages on the chopping block. While most of these pages might seem inconsequential\u2014GeoCities was famous for its amateurish, early-web aesthetic and its pages dedicated to various collections, obsessions, or fandoms\u2014they represented an early chapter of the web, and one that was about to be lost forever.",
    "And it would have been, if a ragtag group of volunteer archivists led by Jason Scott hadn\u2019t stepped in.\u00a0 \u201cWe sprang into action, and part of the fury and confusion of the time was we were going from downloading a handful of interesting sites to suddenly taking on an anchoring website of the early web,\u201d Scott recalls. His group, called Archive Team, quickly mobilized and downloaded as many GeoCities pages as possible before it closed for good. He and the team ended up being able to save most of the site, archiving millions of pages between April and October 2009. He estimates that they managed to download and store around a terabyte, but he notes that the size of GeoCities waxed and waned and was around nine terabytes at its peak. Much was likely gone for good. \u201cIt contained 100% user-generated works, folk art, and honest examples of human beings writing information and histories that were nowhere else,\u201d he says. Known for his top hat and cyberpunk-infused sense of style, Scott has made it his life\u2019s mission to help save parts of the web that are at risk of being lost. \u201cIt is becoming more understood that archives, archiving, and preservation are a choice, a duty, and not something that just happens like the tides,\u201d he says.  Scott now works as \u201cfree-range archivist and software curator\u201d with the Internet Archive, an online library started in 1996 by the internet pioneer Brewster Kahle to save and store information that would otherwise be lost.\u00a0  As a society, we\u2019re creating so much new stuff that we must always delete more things than we did the year before.  Over the past two decades, the Internet Archive has amassed a gigantic library of material scraped from around the web, including that GeoCities content. It doesn\u2019t just save purely digital artifacts, either; it also has a vast collection of digitized books that it has scanned and rescued. Since it began, the Internet Archive has collected more than 145 petabytes of data, including more than 95 million public media files such as movies, images, and texts. It has managed to save almost half a million MTV news pages. Its Wayback Machine, which lets users rewind to see how certain websites looked at any point in time, has more than 800 billion web pages stored and captures a further 650 million each day. It also records and stores TV channels from around the world and even saves TikToks and YouTube videos. They are all stored across multiple data centers that the Internet Archive owns itself. It\u2019s a Sisyphean task. As a society, we\u2019re creating so much new stuff that we must always delete more things than we did the year before, says Jack Cushman, director at Harvard\u2019s Library Innovation Lab, where he helps libraries and technologists learn from one another. We \u201chave to figure out what gets saved and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd how do we decide?\u201d",
    "MIKE MCQUADE   Archivists have to make such decisions constantly. Which TikToks should we save for posterity, for example? We shouldn\u2019t try too hard to imagine what future historians would find interesting about us, says Niels Br\u00fcgger, an internet researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark. \u201cWe cannot imagine what historians in 30 years\u2019 time would like to study about today, because we don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we shouldn\u2019t try to anticipate and sort of constrain the possible questions that future historians would ask.\u201d",
    "Instead, Br\u00fcgger says, we should just save as much stuff as possible and let them figure it out later. \u201cAs a historian, I would definitely go for: Get it all, and then historians will find out what the hell they\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d he says. At the Internet Archive, it\u2019s the stuff most at risk of being lost that gets prioritized, says Jefferson Bailey, who works there helping develop archiving software for libraries and institutions. \u201cMaterial that is ephemeral or at risk or has not yet been digitized and therefore is more easily destroyed, because it\u2019s in analog or print format\u2014those do get priority,\u201d he says.\u00a0  People can request that pages be archived. Libraries and institutions also make nominations. And the staff sorts out the rest. Across open social media like TikTok and YouTube, archive teams at libraries around the world select certain accounts, copy what they want to save, and share those copies with the Internet Archive. It could be snapshots of what was trending each day, as well as tweets or videos from accounts run by notable individuals such as the US president.

    "The process can\u2019t capture everything, but it offers a pretty good slice of what has preoccupied us in the early decades of the 21st century. While historical records have typically relied upon the private letters and belongings of society\u2019s richest, an archive process that scrapes tweets is always going to be a bit more egalitarian. \u201cYou can get a very interesting and diverse snapshot of our cultural moments of the last 30, 40 years,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThat is very different from what a traditional archive looked like 100 years ago.\u201d\u00a0 As citizens, we could also help future historians. Br\u00fcgger suggests people could make \u201cdata donations\u201d of their personal correspondence to archives. \u201cOne week per year, invite everyone to donate the emails from that week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you had these time slices of email correspondence from thousands of people, year by year, that would be really great.\u201d",
    "Scott imagines future historians eventually using AI to query these archives to gain a unique insight into how we lived. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to ask a machine: \u2018Could you show me images of people enjoying themselves at amusement parks with their families from the \u201960s?\u2019 and it will go, \u2018Here you go,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe work we did up to here was done in faith that something like this might exist.\u201d The past guides the future Human knowledge doesn\u2019t always disappear with a dramatic flourish like GeoCities; sometimes it is erased gradually. You don\u2019t know something\u2019s gone until you go back to check it. One example of this is \u201clink rot,\u201d where hyperlinks on the web no longer direct you to the right target, leaving you with broken pages and dead ends. A Pew Research Center study from May 2024 found that 23% of web pages that were around in 2013 are no longer accessible. It\u2019s not just web links that die without constant curation and care. Unlike paper, the formats that now store most of our data require certain software or hardware to run. And these tools can become obsolete quickly. Many of our files can no longer be read because the applications that read them are gone or the data has become corrupted, for example. One way to mitigate this problem is to transfer important data to the latest medium on a regular basis, before the programs required to read it are lost forever. At the Internet Archive and other libraries, the way information is stored is refreshed every few years. But for data that is not being actively looked after, it may be only a few years before the hardware required to access it is no longer available. Think about once ubiquitous storage mediums like Zip drives or CompactFlash.",
    "Some researchers are looking into ways to make sure we can always access old digital formats, even if the kit required to read them has become a museum piece. The Olive project, run by Mahadev Satyanarayanan at Carnegie Mellon University, aims to make it possible for anyone to use any application, however old, \u201cwith just a click.\u201d His team has been working since 2012 to create a huge, decentralized network that supports \u201cvirtual machines\u201d\u2014emulators for old or defunct operating systems and all the software that they run. Keeping old data alive like this is a way to protect against what the computer scientist Danny Hillis once dubbed the \u201cdigital dark age,\u201d a nod to the early medieval period when a lack of written material left future historians little to go on. Hillis, an MIT alum who pioneered parallel computing, thinks the rapid technological upheaval of our time will leave much of what we\u2019re living through a mystery to scholars.\u00a0  \u201cAs I get older, I keep thinking, how can I be a good ancestor?\u201d Vint Cerf, one of the internet\u2019s founders \u201cWhen people look back at this period, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, well, you know, here was this sort of incomprehensibly fast technological change, and a lot of history got lost during that change,\u201d he says. Hillis was one of the founders (along with Brian Eno and Stewart Brand) of the Long Now Foundation, a San Francisco\u2013based organization that is known for its eye-catching art/science projects such as the Clock of the Long Now, a Jeff Bezos\u2013funded gigantic mechanical clock currently under construction in a mountain in West Texas that is designed to keep accurate time for 10,000 years. It also created the Rosetta Disc, a circle of nickel that has been etched at microscopic scale with documentation for around 1,500 of the world\u2019s languages. In February, a copy of the disc touched down on the moon aboard the Odysseus lander. Part of the Long Now\u2019s focus is to help people think about how we protect our history for future generations. It\u2019s not just about making life easier for historians. It\u2019s about helping us be \u201cbetter ancestors,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s mission statement. \u00a0 It\u2019s a sentiment that chimes with Vint Cerf, one of the internet\u2019s founders. \u201cAs I get older, I keep thinking, how can I be a good ancestor?\u201d he says. \u201cAn understanding of what has happened in the past is helpful for anticipating or interpreting what\u2019s happening in the present and what might happen in the future,\u201d says Cerf. There are \u201call kinds of scenarios where the absence of knowledge of the past is a debilitating weakness for a society.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIf we don\u2019t remember, we can\u2019t think, and the way that society remembers is by writing things down and putting them in libraries,\u201d agrees Kahle. Without such repositories, he says, \u201cpeople will be confused as to what\u2019s true and not true.\u201d  Kahle started the Internet Archive as a way to make sure all knowledge is free for anyone, but he feels the balance of power has tilted away from libraries and toward corporations. And that is likely to be a problem for keeping things accessible in the long term. Related StoryThe future of TikTok bansIs Montana's ban even enforceable?",
    "\u201cIf it\u2019s left up to the corporations, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only are we talking about classic published works\u2014like your magazine, or books\u2014but we\u2019re talking about Facebook pages, Twitter pages, your personal blogs. All of those in general are on corporate platforms now. And those will all disappear.\u201d Losing our long-term digital archives has real implications for how society runs, says Harvard\u2019s Cushman, who points out that our legal decisions and paperwork are largely stored digitally. Without a permanent, unalterable record, we can no longer rely on past judgments to inform the present. His team has created ways to let courts and law journals put copies of web pages on file at the Harvard Law Library, where they are stored indefinitely as a record of legal precedent. It\u2019s also creating tools to let people interact with these archives by scrolling through historical versions of a site, or by using a custom GPT to interact with collections. Many other groups are working on similar solutions. The US Library of Congress has suggested standards for storing video, audio, and web files so they are accessible for future generations. It urges archivists to think about issues such as whether the data includes instructions on how to access it, or how widely adopted the format has been (the idea being that a more prevalent one is less likely to become obsolete quickly). But ultimately, digital archives are harder to keep than physical archives, says Cushman. \u201cIf you run out of budget and leave books in a quiet, dark room for 10 years, they\u2019re happy,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you fail to pay your AWS bill for a month, your files are gone forever.\u201d Storage for impossible time scales Even the physical way we store digital data is impermanent. Most long-term storage in data centers\u2014for use in disaster recovery, among other applications\u2014is on magnetic hard drives or tape. Hard drives wear out after a few years. Tape is a little better, but it still doesn\u2019t get you much beyond a decade or so of storage use before it begins to fail.\u00a0 Companies make new backups all the time, so this is less of a problem for the short-to-medium term. But when you want to store important cultural, legal, or historical information for the ages, you need to think differently. You need something that can store huge amounts of data but can also withstand the test of time and doesn\u2019t need constant care.\u00a0 DNA has often been touted as a long-term storage option. It can store astonishing amounts of information and is incredibly long-lasting. Pieces of bone contain readable DNA from many hundreds of thousands of years ago. But encoding information in DNA is currently expensive and slow, and specialized equipment is required to \u201cread\u201d the information back later. That makes it impractical as a serious long-term backup for our world\u2019s knowledge, at least for now.  MIKE MCQUADE   Luckily, there are already a handful of compelling alternatives. One of the most advanced ideas is Project Silica, currently under development at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, where Richard Black and his team are creating a new form of long-term storage on glass squares that can last hundreds or even thousands of years. Each one is created using a precise, powerful laser, which writes nanoscale deformations into the glass beneath the surface that can encode bits of information. These tiny imperfections are layered up on top of one another in the glass and are then read using a powerful microscope that can detect the way light is refracted and polarized. Machine learning is used to decode the bits, and each square has enough training data to let future historians retrain a model from scratch if required, says Black.\u00a0 When I hold one of the Silica squares in my hand, it feels pleasingly sci-fi, as if I\u2019ve just pulled it out to shut down HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The encoded data is visible as a faint blue where the light hits the imperfections and scatters. A video shared by Microsoft shows these squares being microwaved, boiled, baked in an oven, and zapped with a high-powered magnet, all with no apparent ill effects. Black imagines Silica being used to store long-term scientific archives, such as medical information or weather data, over decades. Crucially, the technology can create archives that can be air-gapped (cut off from the internet) and need no power or special care. They can just be locked away in a silo and should work fine and be readable centuries from now. \u201cHumanity has never stopped building microscopes,\u201d says Black. In 2019 Warner Bros. archived some of its back catalogue on Silica glass, including the 1978 classic Superman.\u00a0 Related StoryThese six questions will dictate the future of generative AIGenerative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Its future\u2014and ours\u2014will be shaped by what we do next.",
    "Black\u2019s team has also designed a library storage system for Silica. Shelves packed with thousands of the glass squares line a small room at the Cambridge office. Handbag-size robots attached to the shelves whiz along them and occasionally stop, unclip themselves from one shelf, and clamber up or down to another before shooting off again down the line. When they reach a specific spot, they stop and pluck one of the squares, no bigger than a CD, from the shelf. Its contents are read and the robot zips back into position. Meanwhile, deep in the vaults of an abandoned mine in Svalbard, Norway, GitHub is storing some of history\u2019s most important software (including the source code for Linux, Android, and Python) on special film its creators claim can last for more than 500 years. The film, made by the firm Piql, is coated in microscopic silver halide crystals that permanently darken when exposed to light. A high-powered light source is used to create dark pixels just six micrometers across, which encode binary data. A scanner then reads the data back. Instructions for how to access the information are written in English on each roll, in case there is no longer anyone around to explain how it works.\u00a0 In addition to GitHub\u2019s collection, the storage facility, known as the Arctic World Archive, also includes data supplied by the Vatican and the European Space Agency, as well as various artworks and images from governments and institutions around the world. Yale University, for example, has stored a collection of software, including Microsoft Office and Adobe, as Piql data. Just a few hundred meters down the road you find the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a storage facility preserving a selection of the world\u2019s biodiversity for future generations. Data about what each seed container holds is also stored on Piql film. Making sure this information is stored in formats that can be decoded hundreds of years from now will be crucial. As Cushman points out, we still argue over the proper way to play Charlie Chaplin films because the intended playback speed was never recorded. \u201cWhen researchers are trying to access these materials decades in the future, how expensive will it be to build tools to display them, and what will be the chances that we get it wrong?\u201d he asks.  Ultimately, the motivation for all these projects is the idea that they will act as humanity\u2019s backup. A long-term medium that will withstand an apocalypse, an electromagnetic pulse from the sun, the end of civilization, and let us start again.\u00a0 Something to let people know we were here. Happy accidents Sometime in the first century, a Roman woman called Claudia Severa was planning a big birthday party at a fort in northern England. She asked her servant to write out an invitation to one of her best friends on a wooden tablet and then signed it with a flourish.\u00a0 Claudia could never have suspected that, almost 2,000 years on, the Vindolanda Tablets (of which her invitation is the most famous) would be used to give us a unique insight into the daily lives of Romans in England at that time. That\u2019s always the way. Throughout history, the oddest, most random things survived to act as a guide for historians. The same will go for us. Despite the efforts of archivists, librarians, and storage researchers, it\u2019s impossible to know for sure what data will still be accessible when we\u2019re long gone. And we might be surprised at what they find interesting when they come across it. Which batch of archived emails or TikToks will be the key to unlocking our era for future historians and anthropologists? And what will they think of us? Historians foraging through our digital detritus may be left with a series of unanswerable questions, and they\u2019ll just have to make best guesses.\u00a0  Throughout history, the oddest, most random things survived to act as a guide for historians. The same will go for us.  \u201cYou\u2019d need to ask about who had digital technology,\u201d says Bell. \u201cAnd how did they power it? And who got to make choices about it? And how was it stored and circulated? And who saw it?\u201d We don\u2019t know what will still be running 20, 50, or 100 years from now. Perhaps Google Photos\u2019 cloud storage will have been abandoned, a giant garbage pile of old hard drives buried in the ground. Or maybe, with luck, one of the spiritual heirs to Scott\u2019s archivists will have saved it before it went down.\u00a0 Maybe someone downloaded it onto some sort of glass disc and stashed it in a vault somewhere. Maybe some future anthropologist will one day find it, dust it off, and find that it\u2019s still readable.\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019ll select a file at random, spin up some sort of software emulator, and find a billion photos from 2013.\u00a0 And see a chubby, happy girl sitting in the grass.
