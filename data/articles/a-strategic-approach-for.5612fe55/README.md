The core premise of the strategic concept of “proximity” is that, thanks to digital technologies, value is being created closer and closer to the moment of demand — not just in time but also physically closer. This means companies can, in effect, procrastinate and wait until customer demand is present before producing an actual product or service. This trend, which is made possible by technologies ranging from AI to 3D printing to IoT, can help leaders make smart strategic decisions, especially when they feel overwhelmed by new trends and the speed of change. To do so, they need to first understand the four big shifts that are driving proximity, and then begin to brainstorm ways proximity can pay off in their own organizations.
