The article provides a detailed report about political power struggles in Sri Lanka, focusing on President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's (CBK) attempt to extend her term in office in 2005. CBK claims her term ends in 2006 due to being sworn in twice, a notion disputed by the Supreme Court.

Mahinda Rajapaksa, a candidate for presidency in the 2005 election, formed an alliance with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a move that made CBK angry. CBK, in a letter to Mahinda, expressed her displeasure over his alliance with the JVP and his breach of the previously agreed P-TOMS pact.

Mahinda, along with the JVP, began campaigning in CBK's absence, with the latter leaving for the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

In the meantime, a Presidential debate between Mahinda and Ranil Wickremesinghe never took place due to disagreement over the ground rules and choice of moderator.

The article concludes by stating that the JVP, along with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), played a small role, contributing to Mahinda's victory in the 2005 elections.
