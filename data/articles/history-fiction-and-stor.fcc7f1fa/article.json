    "Yudhanjaya Wijeratne on alternate histories, narrative power, and the myths that shape us",
    "In a conversation that spans history, fiction, and the human tendency to shape narratives to fit our worldview, Sri Lankan writer and data scientist Yudhanjaya Wijeratne, who was a panelist at the Galle Literary Fest 2025, discusses the interplay between fact and fiction, the limits of historical truth, and why some stories persist while others fade\u2026",
    "\u201cSometimes fiction is a little bit truer than reality,\u201d Wijeratne remarks early in our conversation on the sidelines of the Galle Literary Festival (GLF). It\u2019s a statement that seems paradoxical at first, but he explains it through the lens of both literature and data science.",
    "\u201cHumans are not necessarily great at facts, we are storytellers \u2013 we make sense of our lives through stories,\u201d he says. \u201cWe try to draw cause and effect, creating explanations that fit our worldview. And in many cases, fictional narratives help us understand certain truths better than raw data ever could.\u201d",
    "This observation carries through much of Wijeratne\u2019s work. A writer of speculative fiction, his stories often examine alternate futures and hypothetical histories, exploring ways in which technology, society, and politics might evolve. But as we discuss the blurred lines between history and fiction, it becomes clear that our understanding of the past is just as much a product of narrative construction as any futuristic dystopia.",
    "History as a construct",
    "\u201cHistory is a story,\u201d Wijeratne asserts. \u201cThe best we can do is reconstruct it as accurately as possible, but we are not omniscient. Some records survive, others don\u2019t. Some perspectives dominate, others are erased. What we call history is, in many ways, the version of events that won out.\u201d",
    "As we discuss how civilisations selectively curate their past, shaping national myths that reinforce cultural identities, he cites the case of Sri Lanka\u2019s foundational legend of Vijaya \u2013 the Indian prince who was exiled, arrived on the island, and established the Sinhalese race.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we choose that story,\u201d Wijeratne muses. \u201cWhy is the Vijaya story more important to us and what does that say about us? What about the tribes that lived here before \u2013 the Yakshas, the Nagas? Why do we omit those stories?\u201d",
    "This tendency to cherry-pick narratives is not unique to Sri Lanka. Wijeratne references the Battle of Thermopylae, immortalised in Western culture as the heroic stand of 300 Spartans against the Persian Empire. \u201cThe reality,\u201d he points out, \u201cis that they got their backsides kicked. They were only part of a much larger Greek force, and they didn\u2019t achieve anything until the other city-states joined in. But we\u2019ve chosen the version of the story that resonates with our ideals of sacrifice and heroism.\u201d",
    "Does selective storytelling cross into the realm of misinformation? Are fiction writers, particularly those exploring alternate history, at risk of creating narratives that future generations might mistake for fact?",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s for the future to decide,\u201d Wijeratne says. \u201cWe already live in a world where myths have taken root as fact. Look at the US military\u2019s obsession with the Spartan myth. Look at how historical figures are reimagined to suit modern politics. Stories take on lives of their own.\u201d",
    "This, he argues, is why fiction can be more powerful than mere facts. \u201cYou can walk up to someone and present them with raw data, and it won\u2019t change their mind. But a story? That gets through.\u201d",
    "Wijeratne sees literature as existing in the space between the writer and the reader. \u201cYou write a book, but by the time it reaches the reader, it has changed. They reinterpret it through their own lens, their own experiences.\u201d",
    "He likens this to religious texts such as the Bible, which continue to be reinterpreted across generations. \u201cThe core stories remain, but they adapt to new times, new contexts. That\u2019s why they persist.\u201d",
    "The same applies to fiction. \u201cThe human condition hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. We still feel loss, anger, regret, love \u2013 whether we\u2019re looking at a smartphone or sitting around a fire thousands of years ago. The stories that endure are the ones that tap into those emotions.\u201d",
    "Writing without boundaries",
    "Speaking about his own writing philosophy, Wijeratne rejects the notion of being bound to specific themes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be obligated to write about war or trauma just because we come from Sri Lanka. That\u2019s a damper on imagination. If those themes emerge naturally, fine \u2013 but I want to explore what fascinates me, whether it\u2019s starships or dystopias or something else entirely.\u201d",
    "He also expresses frustration with books that feel engineered to win awards or check ideological boxes. \u201cI like stories where you can tell the author went down a weird rabbit hole, where their curiosity drove the narrative.\u201d",
    "His upcoming books, The Wretched and the Damned and The Pilgrim Machine, continue his tradition of speculative exploration, examining future societies and the impact of technology. But as our conversation reveals, his real fascination lies in the age-old question: Why do we believe the stories we tell ourselves?",
    "Returning to the idea that our myths, histories, and fictions are all deeply intertwined, he says, \u201cWe choose the stories that define us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those choices reveal who we are.\u201d",
    "Whether examining the past or imagining the future, the narratives we create \u2013 and believe \u2013 shape the world as much as any historical event. And in that sense, fiction may indeed be the greatest truth of all.",
    "GLF: A convergence of literary minds",
    "Yudhanjaya Wijeratne also spoke on the Galle Literary Festival as both an attendee and a panellist. \u201cFor writers in Sri Lanka,\u201d Wijeratne noted, \u201cone of the most valuable aspects of GLF is the chance to meet other working professionals. Unlike countries with robust literary ecosystems \u2013 where conventions, workshops, and networking events are commonplace \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s literary scene can feel fragmented. GLF bridges this gap, providing a rare platform where writers can engage in meaningful dialogue about the craft, the industry, and the art of storytelling itself.\u201d",
    "He says, the interaction isn\u2019t just about casual conversation; it\u2019s an exchange of ideas that can profoundly influence a writer\u2019s trajectory. For Wijeratne, whose work is predominantly published in the US and UK, GLF offers a chance to connect with peers he might not otherwise meet. It\u2019s a space where literary minds converge, fostering a sense of community that\u2019s often missing in the solitary world of writing.",
    "Beyond its impact on writers, GLF serves a crucial role in reaffirming the value of literature within Sri Lankan society. In a time when economic pressures often steer young people toward careers in technology, business, or medicine, literature can be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity. The festival challenges this notion.",
    "\u201cGLF has a certain glamour about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt maintains a standard that elevates literature\u2019s prestige, reminding us that storytelling is not just entertainment \u2013 it\u2019s a vital part of our cultural identity.\u201d This glamour isn\u2019t about exclusivity; it\u2019s about creating an environment where literature is celebrated, where writers are respected, and where intellectual curiosity is encouraged.",
    "Balancing scale with intimacy",
    "Wijeratne observed that one of the festival\u2019s defining characteristics is its intimacy. Unlike massive literary gatherings like the Jaipur Literature Festival, where sheer scale can dilute meaningful interactions, GLF maintains a more personal atmosphere. This intimacy, however, comes with its own set of challenges.",
    "The festival relies heavily on sponsorships, with ticket sales covering only a fraction of its costs. Scaling up could increase revenue, but it risks losing the unique charm that makes GLF special. As Wijeratne pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having 150 people from the local writing scene \u2013 it\u2019s about creating high-value spaces where meaningful exchanges can happen.\u201d",
    "Beyond the festival: Building an ecosystem",
    "While GLF is a powerful anchor, Wijeratne believes supporting Sri Lankan writers requires more than a once-a-year event. \u201cA festival is great, but it\u2019s not enough. We need long-term resources \u2013 mentorship programs, writing residencies, and educational initiatives that nurture talent beyond the festival\u2019s brief window.\u201d",
    "Drawing from his own experiences, Wijeratne highlighted models like Clarion West, a six-week residency for speculative fiction writers, and the University of Oslo\u2019s free course on speculative fiction, which he had helped develop. \u201cPrograms like these offer sustained support, helping writers develop their craft in a structured environment.\u201d",
    "GLF\u2019s growing focus on Sri Lankan writers is a positive sign. In its early years, the festival often felt more international than local, but this is changing. Wijeratne sees this as an opportunity: \u201cWhile GLF can\u2019t be everything to everyone, it can inspire others to create complementary spaces. Imagine if visiting authors extended their stay for workshops or residencies, mentoring emerging writers. Imagine libraries hosting regular literary discussions, or community-funded festivals popping up across the country. GLF can\u2019t do it all \u2013 but it can spark ideas, foster connections, and remind us of literature\u2019s enduring power.\u201d",
    "In the end, the festival\u2019s true success isn\u2019t just in packed venues or celebrity authors. It\u2019s in conversations that linger long after the event, the stories that are written because of a chance encounter, and the young writers who find their voice in a world that often tells them to stay silent.",
    "As Sri Lanka continues to define its place in the global cultural landscape, GLF stands as both a mirror and a beacon \u2013 a reflection of our literary heritage and a light guiding us toward a richer, more vibrant future."
