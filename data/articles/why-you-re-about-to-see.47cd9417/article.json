If you follow drone news closely\u2014and you\u2019re forgiven if you don\u2019t\u2014you may have noticed over the last few months that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been quite busy. For decades, the agency had been a thorn in the side of drone evangelists, who wanted more freedom to fly drones in shared airspaces or dense neighborhoods. The FAA\u2019s rules have made it cumbersome for futuristic ideas like drones delivering packages to work at scale.  Lately, that\u2019s been changing. The agency recently granted Amazon\u2019s Prime Air program approval to fly drones beyond the visual line of sight from its pilots in parts of Texas. The FAA has also granted similar waivers to hundreds of police departments around the country, which are now able to fly drones miles away, much to the ire of privacy advocates.\u00a0 However, while the FAA doling out more waivers is notable, there\u2019s a much bigger change coming in less than a month. It promises to be the most significant drone decision in decades, and one that will decide just how many drones we all can expect to see and hear buzzing above us in the US on a daily basis.",
    "By September 16\u2014if the FAA adheres to its deadline\u2014the agency must issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking about whether drones can be flown beyond a visual line of sight. In other words, rather than issuing one-off waivers to police departments and delivery companies, it will propose a rule that applies to everyone using the airspace and aims to minimize the safety risk of drones flying into one another or falling and injuring people or property below.\u00a0 The FAA was first directed to come up with a rule back in 2018, but it hasn\u2019t delivered. The September 16 deadline was put in place by the most recent FAA Reauthorization Act, signed into law in May. The agency will have 16 months after releasing the proposed rule to issue a final one.",
    "Who will craft such an important rule, you ask? There are 87 organizations on the committee. Half are either commercial operators like Amazon and FedEx, drone manufacturers like Skydio, or other tech interests like Airbus or T-Mobile. There are also a handful of privacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as academic researchers.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear where exactly the agency\u2019s proposed rule will fall, but experts in the drone space told me that the FAA has grown much more accommodating of drones, and they expect this ruling to be reflective of that shift.\u00a0 If the rule makes it easier for pilots to fly beyond their line of sight, nearly every type of drone pilot will benefit from fewer restrictions. Groups like search and rescue pilots could more easily use drones to find missing persons in the wilderness without an FAA waiver, which is hard to obtain quickly in an emergency situation.\u00a0 But if more drones take to the skies with their pilots nowhere in sight, it will have massive implications. \u201cThe [proposed rule] will likely allow a broad swatch of operators to conduct wide-ranging drone flights beyond their visual line of sight,\u201d says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \u201cThat could open up the skies to a mass of delivery drones (from Amazon and UPS to local \u2018burrito-copters\u2019 and other deliveries), local government survey or code-enforcement flights, and a whole new swath of police surveillance operations.\u201d  Read more about what\u2019s coming next for drones from me here.

The previously unreported project is intended to improve how facial recognition algorithms track children over time. Why this matters: Facial recognition technology (FRT) has traditionally not been applied to children, largely because training data sets of real children\u2019s faces are few and far between, and consist of either low-quality images drawn from the internet or small sample sizes with little diversity. Such limitations reflect the significant sensitivities regarding privacy and consent when it comes to minors. A DHS program specifically trained on images of children, immigrants\u2019 rights organizations and privacy advocates told MIT Technology Review, raises serious concern about whether children will be able to opt out of biometric data collection.
