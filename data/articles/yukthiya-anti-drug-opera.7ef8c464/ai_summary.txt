The high number of arrests and implementation of controversial strategies in Sri Lanka's anti-drug operation named Yukthiya (means 'justice' in Sinhala) have raised questions about its adherence to the rule of law and human rights, along with its effectiveness. More than 110,000 individuals have been arrested since its launch in December 2023, but most were released after paying a fine or getting bail, suggesting the intent to create an illusion of effective government action. Furthermore, many of those arrested were drug users, not traffickers. Officials have been criticized for criminalizing drug use and reliance on compulsory drug treatment with questionable effectiveness. There have been allegations of due process violations during arrests, abuse, and property damage, while public statements from Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police have been seen as undermining the judicial process. Critics argue that the involvement of the military in the operation is indicative of an attempt to normalize its militarization.
