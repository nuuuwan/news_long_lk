    "After the European Parliament elections in early June, Europe\u2019s busy electoral summer continues with a two-round snap French vote and the UK general election. In the UK, a win for the centre-left\u00a0opposition Labour Party\u00a0appears a foregone conclusion after 14 years of Conservative rule.\u00a0A large majority should enable progress on Labour\u2019s modest tax-and-spend agenda, boosting British investment.\u00a0In contrast, the outcome of the\u00a0French legislative\u00a0vote is highly uncertain. A hung parliament with a prime minister from a broad alliance of mainstream parties is the most likely outturn, but\u00a0we assign a 40% probability to a far-right French prime minister\u2014a scenario that is prompting market jitters.\u00a0In either case, policymaking is likely to stall.",
    "The rise in support for the far right that was evident in the\u00a0European Parliament elections\u00a0will also create headlines in the Austrian general election in September.\u00a0The\u00a0Freedom Party\u00a0(currently a junior partner in the government) is leading in the polls and will emerge as the largest party in the Austrian coalition after the vote\u2014although its ability to influence policy (in particular towards a stricter stance on migration) will be tempered by who it governs with.\u00a0The other country where we see the potential for a shift in policy later this year is\u00a0Lithuania.\u00a0There the centre-right coalition is set to be replaced by a centre-left administration\u2014although the country\u2019s pro-NATO, pro-EU and pro-business positioning will not change.",
    "The presidential elections that are approaching will be less significant than the legislative votes, as these roles are mostly ceremonial. However, the probable re-election in October of the pro-EU Maia Sandu in Moldova is noteworthy, as it will coincide with a referendum on the country\u2019s continued pro-EU path, which we expect to be successful.\u00a0Moldova\u2019s trajectory\u00a0stands in marked contrast to developments in Georgia, where the government\u2019s recent passing of a\u00a0foreign agents law\u00a0puts any hope of future EU accession in jeopardy. We expect the current government to be re-elected in a vote that is neither free nor fair.",
    "Other votes to watch out for are the German regional elections in September, where the far right will do well, and mainstream parties will be forced to decide whether to break the current taboo against co-operation\u2014a significant decision in view of the approaching federal election in 2025. We also expect a\u00a0snap election in Ireland\u00a0this autumn, and there is a risk of an early vote in Portugal. Still,\u00a0the election that will have the biggest impact on the outlook for the region will not be in Europe at all, but\u00a0in the US\u00a0in November, where polls suggest the result is on a knife edge.",
