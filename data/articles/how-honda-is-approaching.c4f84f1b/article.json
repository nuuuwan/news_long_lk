    "Honda has long been a leader in sustainability in the global automotive industry. The carmaker introduced the CVCC engine in the early 1970s to cut smog-forming emissions, and it produced the first battery-electric vehicles in the 1990s and hydrogen fuel cell-electric vehicles in the early 2000s, both of which used innovative technologies to reduce or eliminate tailpipe emissions of vehicles in use.",
    "But what about the environmental impact of products at the end of their useful life?",
    "As part of its ambitious goal of achieving zero environmental impact of its products and operations by 2050, Honda is pursuing resource circulation, working to recapture products at the end of their life and recycle or reuse 100% of the materials to create new products.",
    "Creating a circular society supports the company\u2019s goals of achieving carbon neutrality, 100% clean energy use, and 100% resource circulation.",
    "Achieving resource circulation requires major innovations in the design and end-of-life recovery of its products and in the procurement of parts, goods, and services to reduce its environmental impact.",
    "Design for Resource Circulation",
    "At the heart of Honda\u2019s resource circulation efforts is product design.",
    "Here, the company views sustainability holistically, selecting materials and creating design elements that prioritize longevity and recyclability. This is especially critical, as the initial design phase determines 80% of a product\u2019s environmental impact.",
    "\u201cHonda\u2019s commitment to sustainable materials isn\u2019t just about using recycled plastics and other reusable materials; it\u2019s about rethinking the entire product life cycle,\u201d says Mathew Daniel, indirect procurement department lead at Honda. \u201cBy designing for disassembly and maintainability [ease of maintenance], we envision everything we purchase, from parts for our vehicles to forklifts used in our factories, being reused or recycled, reducing our environmental footprint and generating new business value.\u201d",
    "Maximizing Useful Life",
    "Honda is exploring the entire scope of its corporate purchasing to maximize the useful life of the goods it buys while avoiding unnecessary purchases.",
    "The process begins with the simplest of questions, Daniel says. \u201cDo we even need to purchase this good in the first place? If we do, can we buy less of it? If not, can we purchase it in a different composition that is more sustainable? Those three questions enable us to develop specifications that will help us achieve the rest of our strategy,\u201d he says. \u201cThis includes maximizing useful life, hopefully yielding a second or third life before having to reclaim the raw materials.\u201d",
    "Honda has collaborated with GEP, a leading global provider of procurement and supply chain solutions, to implement and accelerate its sustainability goals. \u201cThe approach Honda is taking toward sustainability focuses on integrating the right strategies into every aspect of the business, particularly procurement and supply chain,\u201d says Vengat Narayanasamy, vice president of consulting at GEP.",
    "\u201cHonda\u2019s comprehensive view of resource circulation\u2014from design to end-of-life management\u2014ensures that it is not just meeting its environmental goals but also setting new standards for the industry,\u201d Narayanasamy says. \u201cAdditionally, its focus on creating and purchasing durable, repairable products ensures that what it purchases and produces stays in service longer, reducing the need for new resources and cutting down on waste.\u201d",
    "By minimizing the extraction of virgin resources, Honda is helping preserve natural ecosystems and biodiversity. At the same time, reducing waste through circular practices is helping mitigate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Transforming Procurement Processes",
    "Honda focuses on more than the sustainability of its direct materials. The company spends billions of dollars annually on indirect goods and services and is looking at resource circulation in this space as well. Extending the life of purchased goods such as IT hardware, equipment, and office furnishings can reduce overall capital expenditure.",
    "However, purchasing sustainable goods may initially increase capex, so the success of such resource circulation initiatives is in finding solutions that maximize sustainability and protect profitability.",
    "\u201cFrom an operational perspective, our goal is to keep the indirect goods that we purchase in service as long as possible, at their highest possible value, and then recover them for reuse,\u201d Daniel says.",
    "Honda is taking steps to create a resource circulation center with three key functions.",
    "The first is a control tower that will set policies, track effectiveness, and streamline corporate activities.",
    "The second is a physical operation focused on dismantling end-of-life assets and recycling essential raw materials like steel, aluminum, and copper.",
    "The third function, the \u201csecond-life lab,\u201d will explore new ways to repurpose used indirect goods. A prime example of this initiative is Honda\u2019s current practice of converting old factory-worker uniforms into insulation for use in vehicle assembly.",
    "\u201cBy integrating sustainability into every facet of its operations, Honda is not only achieving its goals but also setting a new standard for what\u2019s possible in the realm of sustainable practices,\u201d Narayanasamy says.",
    "Blueprint for a Sustainable Future",
    "The journey Honda is taking toward resource circulation is more than just a commitment to sustainability\u2014it\u2019s a bold step toward reshaping the future of the automotive industry.",
    "With the expertise of partners like GEP, Honda is pioneering new standards in sustainability.",
    "It\u2019s a clear message to the industry: embracing resource circulation is a necessity for driving meaningful change.",
