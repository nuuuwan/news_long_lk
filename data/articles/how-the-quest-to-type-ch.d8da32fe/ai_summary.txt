Chinese users of computer interfaces have historically used input method editors (IME), systems which use a string of keystrokes to call up characters in Mandarin. Every time a user touches a key or screen, the IME retrieves potential Mandarin equivalents from their devices' memory. Using a system based on Romanised Mandarin, users input letters that constitute phonetic descriptions of characters. The arrangement of characters in a sentence can alter the meaning, providing additional depth to a language already built on complexity and subtlety. In English, the relationship between text input and text output is immediate, whereas Mandarin users input in effect a semi-alphanumeric code which a computer translates into Mandarin characters. In the English-speaking world, users could peak at 200 English words per minute, but Mandarin users can achieve nearly twice that rate.
