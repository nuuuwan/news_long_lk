    "Architecture often assumes a binary between built projects and theoretical ones. What physics allows in actual buildings, after all, is vastly different from what architects can imagine and design (often referred to as \u201cpaper architecture\u201d). That imagination has long been supported and enabled by design technology, but the latest advancements in artificial intelligence have prompted a surge in the theoretical.\u00a0 Karl Daubmann, College of Architecture and Design at Lawrence Technological University\u201cVery often the new synthetic image that comes from a tool like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion feels new,\u201d says Daubmann, \u201cinfused by each of the multiple tools but rarely completely derived from them.\u201d \u201cTransductions: Artificial Intelligence in Architectural Experimentation,\u201d a recent exhibition at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, brought together works from over 30 practitioners exploring the experimental, generative, and collaborative potential of artificial intelligence to open up new areas of architectural inquiry\u2014something they\u2019ve been working on for a decade or more, since long before AI became mainstream. Architects and exhibition co-\u00adcurators Jason Vigneri-Beane, Olivia Vien, Stephen Slaughter, and Hart Marlow explain that the works in \u201cTransductions\u201d emerged out of feedback loops among architectural discourses, techniques, formats, and media that range from imagery, text, and animation to mixed-\u00adreality media and fabrication. The aim isn\u2019t to present projects that are going to break ground anytime soon; architects already know how to build things with the tools they have. Instead, the show attempts to capture this very early stage in architecture\u2019s exploratory engagement with AI.  Technology has long enabled architecture to push the limits of form and function. As early as 1963, Sketchpad, one of the first architectural software programs, allowed architects and designers to move and change objects on screen. Rapidly, traditional hand drawing gave way to an ever-expanding suite of programs\u2014\u00adRevit, SketchUp, and BIM, among many others\u2014that helped create floor plans and sections, track buildings\u2019 energy usage, enhance sustainable construction, and aid in following building codes, to name just a few uses.\u00a0 The architects exhibiting in \u201cTrans\u00adductions\u201d view newly evolving forms of AI \u201clike a new tool rather than a profession-\u00adending development,\u201d says Vigneri-Beane, despite what some of his peers fear about the technology. He adds, \u201cI do appreciate that it\u2019s a somewhat unnerving thing for people, [but] I feel a familiarity with the rhetoric.\u201d After all, he says, AI doesn\u2019t just do the job. \u201cTo get something interesting and worth saving in AI, an enormous amount of time is required,\u201d he says. \u201cMy architectural vocabulary has gotten much more precise and my visual sense has gotten an incredible workout, exercising all these muscles which have atrophied a little bit.\u201d Vien agrees: \u201cI think these are extremely powerful tools for an architect and designer. Do I think it\u2019s the entire future of architecture? No, but I think it\u2019s a tool and a medium that can expand the long history of mediums and media that architects can use not just to represent their work but as a generator of ideas.\u201d Andrew Kudless, Hines College of Architecture and DesignThis image, part of the Urban Resolution series, shows how the Stable Diffusion AI model \u201cis unable to focus on constructing a realistic image and instead duplicates features that are prominent in the local latent space,\u201d Kudless says.        Jason Vigneri-Beane, Pratt Institute \u201cThese images are from a larger series on cyborg ecologies that have to do with co-creating with machines to imagine [other] machines,\u201d says Vigneri-Beane. \u201cI might refer to these as cryptomegafauna\u2014infrastructural robots operating at an architectural scale.\u201d  Martin Summers, University of Kentucky College of Design\u201cMost AI is racing to emulate reality,\u201d says Summers. \u201cI prefer to revel in the hallucinations and misinterpretations like glitches and the sublogic they reveal present in a mediated reality.\u201d Jason Lee, Pratt InstituteLee typically uses AI \u201cto generate iterations or high-resolution sketches,\u201d he says. \u201cI am also using it to experiment with how much realism one can incorporate with more abstract representation methods.\u201d        Olivia Vien, Pratt InstituteFor the series Imprinting Grounds, Vien created images digitally and fed them into Midjourney. \u201cIt riffs on the ideas of damask textile patterns in a more digital realm,\u201d she says. Robert Lee Brackett III, Pratt Institute\u201cWhile new software raises concerns about the absence of traditional tools like hand drawing and modeling, I view these technologies as collaborators rather than replacements,\u201d Brackett says.  hide"
