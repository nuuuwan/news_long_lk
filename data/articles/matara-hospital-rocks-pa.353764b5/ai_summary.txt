A Sri Lankan couple experienced a painful incident after the death of their stillborn baby. Hospital staff allegedly discarded the body without their consent or knowledge, and then returned a different body to them, leading to confusion and distress. The couple, Kavindya Madushani and her husband Sajith Chathura, have since demanded a DNA test and post-mortem to ensure they receive their own child's body and to determine the cause of death, after contradictory statements from hospital staff. The Health Ministry has launched an investigation due to the gravity of the issue.
