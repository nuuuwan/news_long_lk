    "Over six years and across four continents, the London-based documentary photographer Zed Nelson has examined how humans have immersed themselves in increasingly simulated environments to mask their destructive divorce from the natural world. Featuring everything from theme parks and zoos to national parks and African safaris, his images reveal not only a desperate craving for a connection to a world we have turned our back on but also a global phenomenon of denial and collective self-\u00addelusion. \u201cPeople may have flocked to see them to see the unfamiliar and the exotic,\u201d he says. \u201cNow they may go to see what is no longer out there, what is endangered, what we have lost.\u201d  Quancheng Ocean Polar World, Shandong, ChinaZED NELSON   World of Water, Watford, UKZED NELSON     In his new photo book, The Anthropocene Illusion, Nelson writes, \u201cIn a tiny fraction of our Earth\u2019s history, we humans have altered our world beyond anything it has experienced in tens of millions of years.\u201d His images document our increasingly futile attempts to create a simulacrum of an Edenic natural world that none of us have actually experienced. The number of wild animals on Earth has halved in the past 40 years, and that decline shows no signs of slowing down. We are forcing animals and plants to extinction by removing their habitats. Future geologists will likely find evidence in the rock strata of an unprecedented human impact on our planet\u2014huge concentrations of plastics, fallout from the burning of fossil fuels, and vast deposits of concrete used to build our cities.\u00a0  Shanghai Wild Animal Park, ChinaZED NELSON   Yet deep within us, the desire for contact with nature remains. So we have become masters of what Nelson calls \u201ca stage-managed, artificial \u2018experience\u2019 of nature, a reassuring spectacle.\u201d  Yosemite National Park, CaliforniaZED NELSON   Rainforest at Tropical Islands holiday resort, Krausnick, GermanyZED NELSON    \u201cCharles Darwin reduced humans to just another species\u2014a twig on the grand tree of life,\u201d Nelson writes in his book\u2019s afterword. \u201cBut now, the paradigm has shifted: humankind is no longer just another species. We are the first to knowingly reshape the living earth\u2019s biology and chemistry. We have become the masters of our planet and integral to the destiny of life on Earth. Surrounding ourselves with simulated recreations of nature paradoxically constitutes an unwitting monument to the very thing that we have lost.\u201d As Jon Mooallem observed in Wild Ones, his cultural history of wild animals and our relationship to them, \u201cWe are everywhere in the wilderness with white gloves on, directing traffic.\u201d"
