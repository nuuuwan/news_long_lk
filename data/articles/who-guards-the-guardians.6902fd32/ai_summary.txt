Three petitions have been filed against the reappointment of "former" High Court Judge Kanishka Wijeratne as Director General (DG) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) in Sri Lanka. The petitioners claim the reappointment violates anti-corruption laws, alleging the process lacked transparency and may involve a conflict of interest. Wijeratne's previous term as DG saw Sri Lanka reach its lowest score in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. The petitioners also argue Wijeratne lacks the mandatory experience in criminal prosecution required for his position. The case could potentially disrupt CIABOC's operations if the appointment is ruled illegal.
