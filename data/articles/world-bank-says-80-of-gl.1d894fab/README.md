# World Bank says 80% of global population will experience slower growth than in pre-COVID decade

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- According to the Global Economic Prospects report from the World Bank, global economic growth is expected to stabilize in 2024 for the first time in three years.
- The projected global growth rate for 2024 is 2.6%, rising to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26, still below the pre-COVID-19 average of 3.1%.
- Developing economies are forecasted to grow by an average of 4% over 2024-25, with growth in low-income economies expected to rise to 5% in 2024 from 3.8% in 2023.
- Advanced economies are projected to maintain growth of 1.5% in 2024 before increasing to 1.7% in 2025.
- One in four developing economies will stay poorer than they were pre-pandemic, with income gaps between developing and advanced economies set to widen.
- Inflation is expected to moderate to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025, however global interest rates are likely to remain high.
- The report outlines public investment's potential to accelerate private investment and promote economic growth, and the fiscal difficulties small states face.

Opinions:
- Indermit Gill, World Bank Group‚Äôs Chief Economist, asserts the growth experienced is at lower levels than before 2020, with developing economies particularly hard hit and requiring international assistance to address issues of debt and infrastructure development.
- The rate of global growth remaining slower than the pre-COVID-19 era, according to Greill, highlights the scale of the challenges that low-income countries face.
- The World Bank‚Äôs Deputy Chief Economist, Ayhan Kose, suggests that high core inflation could cause major advanced economies' central banks to delay interest rate cuts, leading to difficult financial conditions and weaker growth in developing economies.
- The report suggests comprehensive reforms and global coordinated policies are necessary to address the fiscal challenges of small states.

1. What are some of the specific strategies that the World Bank recommends for promoting private investment in developing economies?
2. How could the global economy reach pre-COVID-19 growth levels according to the World Bank? 
3. Can you discuss in more detail the challenges faced by low-income economies and what are some recommendations for addressing these challenges? 
4. What would be the impact of another major global crisis on these projections?
5. Which economies are projected to have the highest growth rates within the next few years?

Latest Global Economic Prospects report acknowledges global growth stabilising for first time in three years

The global economy is expected to stabilise for the first time in three years in 2024‚Äîbut at a level that is weak by recent historical standards, according to the World Bank‚Äôs latest Global Economic Prospects report released on Thursday.

Global growth is projected to hold steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. That is well below the 3.1% average in the decade before COVID-19. The forecast implies that over the course of 2024-26 countries that collectively account for more than 80% of the world‚Äôs population and global GDP would still be growing more slowly than they did in the decade before COVID-19.

Overall, developing economies are projected to grow 4% on average over 2024-25, slightly slower than in 2023. Growth in low-income economies is expected to accelerate to 5% in 2024 from 3.8% in 2023. However, the forecasts for 2024 growth reflect downgrades in three out of every four low-income economies since January. In advanced economies, growth is set to remain steady at 1.5% in 2024 before rising to 1.7% in 2025.

‚ÄúFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,‚Äù said World Bank Group‚Äôs Chief Economist and Senior Vice President Indermit Gill. ‚ÄúHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world‚Äôs poorest economies are even more worrisome. They face punishing levels of debt service, constricting trade possibilities, and costly climate events. Developing economies will have to find ways to encourage private investment, reduce public debt, and improve education, health, and basic infrastructure. The poorest among them‚Äîespecially the 75 countries eligible for concessional assistance from the International Development Association‚Äîwill not be able to do this without international support.‚Äù

This year, one in four developing economies is expected to remain poorer than it was on the eve of the pandemic in 2019. This proportion is twice as high for countries in fragile- and conflict-affected situations. Moreover, the income gap between developing economies and advanced economies is set to widen in nearly half of developing economies over 2020-24‚Äîthe highest share since the 1990s. Per capita income in these economies‚Äîan important indicator of living standards‚Äîis expected to grow by 3.0% on average through 2026, well below the average of 3.8% in the decade before COVID-19.

Global inflation is expected to moderate to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025, but the pace of decline is slower than was projected just six months ago. Many central banks, as a result, are expected to remain cautious in lowering policy interest rates. Global interest rates are likely to remain high by the standards of recent decades‚Äîaveraging about 4% over 2025-26, roughly double the 2000-19 average.

‚ÄúAlthough food and energy prices have moderated across the world, core inflation remains relatively high‚Äîand could stay that way,‚Äù said World Bank‚Äôs Deputy Chief Economist and Prospects Group Director Ayhan Kose. ‚ÄúThat could prompt central banks in major advanced economies to delay interest-rate cuts. An environment of ‚Äòhigher-for-longer‚Äô rates would mean tighter global financial conditions and much weaker growth in developing economies.‚Äù

The latest Global Economic Prospects report also features two analytical chapters of topical importance. The first outlines how public investment can be used to accelerate private investment and promote economic growth. It finds that public investment growth in developing economies has halved since the global financial crisis, dropping to an annual average of 5% in the past decade. Yet public investment can be a powerful policy lever. For developing economies with ample fiscal space and efficient government spending practices, scaling up public investment by 1% of GDP can increase the level of output by up to 1.6% over the medium term.

The second analytical chapter explores why small states‚Äîthose with a population of around 1.5 million or less‚Äîsuffer chronic fiscal difficulties. Two-fifths of the 35 developing economies that are small states are at high risk of debt distress or already in it. That‚Äôs roughly twice the share for other developing economies. Comprehensive reforms are needed to address the fiscal challenges of small states. Revenues could be drawn from a more stable and secure tax base. Spending efficiency could be improved‚Äîespecially in health, education, and infrastructure. Fiscal frameworks could be adopted to manage the higher frequency of natural disasters and other shocks. Targeted and coordinated global policies can also help put these countries on a more sustainable fiscal path.
