    "Living comes with a side effect: aging. Despite what you might hear on social media or in advertisements, there are no drugs that are known to slow or reverse human aging. But there\u2019s some evidence to support another approach: cutting back on calories. Caloric restriction (reducing your intake of calories) and intermittent fasting (switching between fasting and eating normally on a fixed schedule) can help with weight loss. But they may also offer protection against some health conditions. And some believe such diets might even help you live longer\u2014a finding supported by new research out this week. (Longevity enthusiast Bryan Johnson famously claims to eat his last meal of the day at 12pm.) Related StoryThese are the best ways to measure your body fatMove over, BMI. It\u2019s time to get SAD.",
    "But the full picture is not so simple. Weight loss isn\u2019t always healthy and neither is restricting your calorie intake, especially if your BMI is low to begin with. Some scientists warn that, based on evidence in animals, it could negatively impact wound healing, metabolism and bone density. This week let\u2019s take a closer look at the benefits\u2014and risks\u2014of caloric restriction. Eating less can make animals live longer. This remarkable finding has been published in scientific journals for the last 100 years. It seems to work in almost every animal studied\u2014everything from tiny nematode worms and fruit flies to mice, rats, and even monkeys. It can extend the lifespan of rodents by between 15% and 60%, depending on which study you look at.",
    "The effect of caloric restriction is more reliable than the leading contenders for an \u201canti-aging\u201d drug. Both rapamycin (an immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplants) and metformin (a diabetes drug) have been touted as potential longevity therapeutics. And both have been found to increase the lifespans of animals in some studies. But when scientists looked at 167 published studies of those three interventions in research animals, they found that caloric restriction was the most \u201crobust.\u201d According to\u00a0their research, published in the journal Aging Cell on Wednesday, the effect of rapamycin was somewhat comparable, but metformin was nowhere near as effective.",
    "\u201cThat is a pity for the many people now taking off-label metformin for lifespan extension,\u201d David Clancy, lecturer in biogerontology at Lancaster University, said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t have any or many adverse effects.\u201d Still, for caloric restriction, so far so good. At least it\u2019s good news for lab animals. What about people? Also on Wednesday, another team of scientists published a separate review of research investigating the effects of caloric restriction and fasting on humans. That review assessed 99 clinical trials, involving over 6,500 adults. (As I said, caloric restriction has been an active area of research for a long time.)

    "Those researchers found that, across all those trials, fasting and caloric restriction did seem to aid weight loss. There were other benefits, too\u2014but they depended on the specific approach to dieting. Fasting every other day seemed to help lower cholesterol, for example. Time-restricted eating, where you only eat within a specific period each day (\u00e0 la Bryan Johnson), by comparison, seemed to increase cholesterol, the researchers\u00a0write in the BMJ. Given that elevated cholesterol in the blood can lead to heart disease, it\u2019s not great news for the time-restricted eaters. Cutting calories\u00a0could also carry broader risks. Dietary restriction seems to impair wound healing in mice and rats, for example. Caloric restriction also seems to affect bone density. In some studies, the biggest effects on lifespan extension are seen when rats are put on calorie-restricted diets early in life. But this approach can affect bone development and reduce bone density by 9% to 30%. It\u2019s also really hard for most people to cut their caloric intake. When researchers ran a two-year trial to measure the impact of a 25% reduction in caloric intake, they found that\u00a0the most their volunteers could cut was 12%. (That study found that caloric restriction reduces markers of inflammation, which can be harmful when it\u2019s chronic, and had only a small impact on bone density.) Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t really understand about caloric restriction. It doesn\u2019t seem to help all animals live longer\u2014it seems to shorten the lifespan of animals with certain genetic backgrounds. And we don\u2019t know whether it extends the lifespan of people. It isn\u2019t possible to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which you deprive people of food from childhood and then wait their entire lives to see when they die. It is notoriously difficult to track or change your diet. And given the unknowns surrounding caloric restriction, it\u2019s too soon to make sweeping recommendations, particularly given that your own personal biology will play a role in any benefits or risks you\u2019ll experience.
