- After seven years of studying ride-hail work, the author found that workers were motivated by micro-choices and playing games with the system.
- Ride-hail workers take advantage of the small choices they get to make; these small choices apparently make them feel in control and fulfilled.
- Drivers would occasionally refuse multiple trips in order to manipulate pricing algorithms and obtain better fares.

- Gig workers, platform managers, and policymakers can all draw important conclusions from the author's research.
- It is suggested that platform companies should be more transparent, displaying details about pay and matching algorithms.
- Policymakers should recognize the growing importance of gig work and develop new regulations to protect and empower these workers.
- The author believes it is important for gig workers to be aware of what motivates them, to avoid the negatives of the system, and not to let it control them.
