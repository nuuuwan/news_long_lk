    "On September 10th the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former Republican president, Donald Trump, held their first (and potentially only) presidential debate ahead of the November election.\u00a0Despite a slow start, Ms\u00a0Harris maintained the upper hand for most of the debate, which we expect will put further momentum behind her\u00a0campaign.",
    "Ms Harris withstood most of Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s attacks, including on issues that will register most with critical voting groups.\u00a0She stumbled in her initial statements about the state of the economy, an issue that continues to top voter interest polls. However, she regained her footing as the debate progressed, and managed to pivot more convincingly to\u00a0her plans\u00a0to combat inflation and grow the economy, although Mr\u00a0Trump rarely pressed her on details. On abortion rights\u2014an issue that has\u00a0long mobilised\u00a0Democrats and swing voters\u2014she framed Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s preference for state-level restrictions as extreme and \u201cimmoral\u201d, to which he failed to respond clearly. On immigration\u2014one of her more vulnerable issues\u2014she highlighted Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s role in killing a\u00a0bipartisan bill\u00a0to strengthen border security and benefited from his fixation on baseless conspiracy theories, which diluted the potency of his attacks. She consistently neutralised his attempts to paint her as a radical leftist, including on issues such as fracking, gun control and public healthcare. If her goal was to strike a sharp contrast with Mr\u00a0Trump on age (he is 78 and she is 59), tone and coherence of messaging, she broadly succeeded. A post-debate endorsement by the American pop star, Taylor Swift, will also boost Ms\u00a0Harris\u2019s standing with young voters, an important demographic for\u00a0Democrats.",
    "At least part of Ms Harris\u2019s debate success is attributable to Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s failure to stay on message, which could further hamper his election bid.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump rarely probed on issues where Democrats have faced difficulty attracting support from within and outside their party, including on immigration and the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war. Instead, he continuously veered into rants about unrelated topics, including the size of crowds at his campaign rallies, which made him appear flustered and unprepared. He focused repeatedly on extreme claims about abortion and border security, which the debate moderators quickly clarified were not true. He also failed to outline his plans on any major policy issue, including reforming the Affordable Care Act, which only flattered Ms\u00a0Harris\u2019s otherwise hastily assembled platform. His statements on foreign policy further worked to his disadvantage, feeding into Ms\u00a0Harris\u2019s claims that he prefers to work with authoritarian leaders and other actors that are against US\u00a0interests.",
    "The next scheduled debate is on October\u00a01st and will be between Ms\u00a0Harris\u2019s and Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s vice-presidential picks. Ms\u00a0Harris has already expressed interest in holding additional presidential debates (none is scheduled at the moment). Mr\u00a0Trump has not accepted her offer and may well refuse, given his poor initial performance against her. Polls remain tight between the two candidates, with Ms\u00a0Harris holding a narrow lead in national polls and gaining ground in the battleground states.\u00a0We expect her debate performance to further entrench her position, and an anticipated\u00a0strong showing\u00a0by her running mate, Tim Walz, at the vice-presidential debate should help to maintain this momentum into October. If this translates into stable polling leads for Ms\u00a0Harris, we will revise our election forecast from a Trump to a Harris\u00a0win.",
