    "Last November, Bradford G. Smith got a brain implant from Elon Musk\u2019s company Neuralink. The device, a set of thin wires attached to a computer about the thickness of a few quarters that sits in his skull, lets him use his thoughts to move a computer pointer on a screen.\u00a0 And by last week he was ready to reveal it in a post on X.  \u201cI am the 3rd person in the world to receive the @Neuralink brain implant. 1st with ALS. 1st Nonverbal. I am typing this with my brain. It is my primary communication,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAsk me anything! I will answer at least all verified users!\u201d Smith\u2019s case is drawing interest because he\u2019s not only communicating via a brain implant but also getting help from Grok, Musk\u2019s AI chatbot, which is suggesting how Smith can add to conversations and drafted some of the replies he posted to X.",
    "The generative AI is speeding up the rate at which he can communicate, but it also raises questions about who is really talking\u2014him or Musk\u2019s software.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The promise of brain-computer interface is that if you can combine it with AI, it can be much faster,\u201d says Eran Klein, a neurologist at the University of Washington who studies the ethics of brain implants.",

    "Smith is a Mormon with three kids who learned he had ALS after a shoulder injury he sustained in a church dodgeball game wouldn\u2019t heal. As the disease progressed, he lost the ability to move anything except his eyes, and he was no longer able to speak. When his lungs stopped pumping, he made the decision to stay alive with a breathing tube. Starting in 2024, he began trying to get accepted into Neuralink\u2019s implant study via \u201ca campaign of shameless self-promotion,\u201d he told his local paper in Arizona: \u201cI really wanted this.\u201d The day before his surgery, Musk himself appeared on a mobile phone screen to wish Smith well. \u201cI hope this is a game changer for you and your family,\u201d Musk said, according to a video of the call. \u201cI am so excited to get this in my head,\u201d Smith replied, typing out an answer using a device that tracks his eye movement. This was the technology he\u2019d previously used to communicate, albeit slowly.  Smith was about to get brain surgery, but Musk\u2019s virtual appearance foretold a greater transformation. Smith\u2019s brain was about to be inducted into a much larger technology and media ecosystem\u2014one of whose goals, the billionaire has said, is to achieve a \u201csymbiosis\u201d of humans and AI. Consider what unfolded on April 27, the day Smith\u00a0 announced on X that he\u2019d received the brain implant and wanted to take questions. One of the first came from \u201cAdrian Dittmann,\u201d an account often suspected of being Musk\u2019s alter ego. Dittmann: \u201cCongrats! Can you describe how it feels to type and interact with technology overall using the Neuralink?\u201d Smith: \u201cHey Adrian, it\u2019s Brad\u2014typing this straight from my brain! It feels wild, like I\u2019m a cyborg from a sci-fi movie, moving a cursor just by thinking about it. At first, it was a struggle\u2014my cursor acted like a drunk mouse, barely hitting targets, but after weeks of training with imagined hand and jaw movements, it clicked, almost like riding a bike.\u201d",
    "Another user, noting the smooth wording and punctuation (a long dash is a special character, used frequently by AIs but not as often by human posters), asked whether the reply had been written by AI.\u00a0 Smith didn\u2019t answer on X. But in a message to MIT Technology Review, he confirmed he\u2019d used Grok to draft answers after he gave the chatbot notes he\u2019d been taking on his progress. \u201cI asked Grok to use that text to give full answers to the questions,\u201d Smith emailed us. \u201cI am responsible for the content, but I used AI to draft.\u201d The exchange on X in many ways seems like an almost surreal example of cross-marketing. After all, Smith was posting from a Musk implant, with the help of a Musk AI, on a Musk media platform and in reply to a famous Musk fanboy, if not actually the \u201calt\u201d of the richest person in the world. So it\u2019s fair to ask: Where does Smith end and Musk\u2019s ecosystem begin?\u00a0 That\u2019s a question drawing attention from neuro-ethicists, who say Smith\u2019s case highlights key issues about the prospect that brain implants and AI will one day merge. What\u2019s amazing, of course, is that Smith can steer a pointer with his brain well enough to text with his wife at home and answer our emails. Since he\u2019d only been semi-famous for a few days, he told us, he didn\u2019t want to opine too much on philosophical questions about the authenticity of his AI-assisted posts. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wade in over my head,\u201d he said. \u201cI leave it for experts to argue about that!\u201d The eye tracker Smith previously used to type required low light and worked only indoors. \u201cI was basically Batman stuck in a dark room,\u201d he explained in a video he posted to X. The implant lets him type in brighter spaces\u2014even outdoors\u2014and quite a bit faster. The thin wires implanted in his brain listen to neurons. Because their signals are faint, they need to be amplified, filtered, and sampled to extract the most important features\u2014which are sent from his brain to a MacBook via radio and then processed further to let him move the computer pointer. With control over this pointer, Smith types using an app. But various AI technologies are helping him express himself more naturally and quickly. One is a service from a startup called ElevenLabs, which created a copy of his voice from some recordings he\u2019d made when he was healthy. The \u201cvoice clone\u201d can read his written words aloud in a way that sounds like him. (The service is already used by other ALS patients who don\u2019t have implants.)",
    "Researchers have been studying how ALS patients feel about the idea of aids like language assistants. In 2022, Klein interviewed 51 people with ALS and found a range of different opinions.\u00a0 Some people are exacting, like a librarian who felt everything she communicated had to be her words. Others are easygoing\u2014an entertainer felt it would be more important to keep up with a fast-moving conversation.",
    "In the video Smith posted online, he said Neuralink engineers had started using language models including ChatGPT and Grok to serve up a selection of relevant replies to questions, as well as options for things he could say in conversations going on around him. One example that he outlined: \u201cMy friend asked me for ideas for his girlfriend who loves horses. I chose the option that told him in my voice to get her a bouquet of carrots. What a creative and funny idea.\u201d\u00a0 These aren\u2019t really his thoughts, but they will do\u2014since brain-clicking once in a menu of choices is much faster than typing out a complete answer, which can take minutes.\u00a0 Smith told us he wants to take things a step further. He says he has an idea for a more \u201cpersonal\u201d large language model that \u201ctrains on my past writing and answers with my opinions and style.\u201d\u00a0 He told MIT Technology Review that he\u2019s looking for someone willing to create it for him: \u201cIf you know of anyone who wants to help me, let me know.\u201d  hide"
