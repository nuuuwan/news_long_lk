    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Some people track sports scores or their favorite artists\u2019 tour set lists. Meanwhile, I\u2019m just waiting to hear which climate tech startups are getting big funding awards from government agencies. It\u2019s basically the same thing.\u00a0 Related StoryInside the government agency shaping the future of energyARPA-E supports high-risk, high-reward energy technologies. Here\u2019s what its new director thinks is coming next.",
    "Every few years, the US agency that\u2019s often called the \u201cenergy moonshot factory\u201d announces such awards for a few companies to help them scale up their technology. (The agency\u2019s official name is the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy, or ARPA-E.) The grants are designed to help companies take their tech from the lab or pilot stage and get it out into the world.\u00a0 The latest batch of these awards was just announced, totaling over $63 million split between four companies. Let\u2019s dig into the winners and consider what each one\u2019s technology says about their respective corners of climate action.",
    "Antora Energy: Heat batteries for industry Let\u2019s start with the company you\u2019re most likely to know if you follow this newsletter: Antora Energy. The California-based company is building thermal batteries for use in heavy industry. I covered the company and its first pilot project last year, and thermal batteries were the readers\u2019 choice winner on our list of Breakthrough Technologies this year.",
    "In case you need a quick refresher, the basic idea behind Antora\u2019s technology is to store energy from cheap, clean wind and solar power in the form of heat, and then use that heat in industrial facilities. It\u2019s an elegant solution to the problem that renewables are available only sometimes, while industry needs clean energy all the time if it wants to cut its carbon emissions, which amount to a whopping 30% of the global total.\u00a0 Antora was awarded $14.5 million to scale its technology. One thing the company hopes to achieve with the cash influx is progress on its second product, which delivers not only heat but also electricity.\u00a0 Queens Carbon: Lower-emissions cement Cement is a climate villain hiding in plain sight, as I\u2019ve covered in this newsletter before. Producing the gray slabs that scaffold our world accounts for about 7% of global emissions.\u00a0 Related StoryHow electricity could help tackle a surprising climate villainSublime Systems is trying to drive down the carbon footprint of cement production.",
    "The challenge in cleaning up the process lies, at least in part, in the fact that lava-hot temperatures are required to kick off the chemical reactions that make cement\u2014I\u2019m talking over 1,500 \u00b0C (2,700 \u00b0F).\u00a0 Queens Carbon developed a new process that cuts down the temperature needed to under 540 \u00b0C (1,000 \u00b0F). Still toasty, but easier to reach efficiently and with electricity, the company\u2019s CEO, CTO, and cofounder Daniel Kopp said on a press call about the awards. Ideally, that electricity will be supplied with renewables, which could mean big emissions savings. Queens Carbon will also pocket $14.5 million, and the funding should help with the construction of a pilot plant currently being built in partnership with a major cement producer, Kopp said on the press call. The company plans to scale up to a full-size plant in late 2028 or 2029.\u00a0 Ion Storage Systems: Next-generation batteries for EVs",
    "The world is always clamoring for better batteries, and Maryland-based Ion Storage Systems wants to deliver with its solid-state lithium-metal technology. We named lithium-metal batteries one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies in 2021. The chemistry could deliver higher energy density, meaning longer range in EVs.\u00a0 Ion Storage Systems is planning to produce its batteries first for military customers. With the funding ($20 million worth), the company may be able to get its tech ready for larger-scale production for the wider customer base of the electric-vehicle market.\u00a0 I was really interested to hear about the emphasis on manufacturing from CTO Greg Hitz on the press call, as scaling up manufacturing has been a major challenge for other companies trying to build solid-state batteries. Hitz also said that the company\u2019s batteries don\u2019t need to be squeezed at high pressure within cells or heated up, and they can be more simply integrated into battery packs.\u00a0  AeroShield Materials: High-tech insulation for more efficient buildings Last but certainly not least is AeroShield Materials. Between 30% and 40% of energy we put into our buildings for heat and cooling is lost through windows and doors\u2014that\u2019s about $40 billion per year for residential buildings, said Elise Strobach, the company\u2019s CEO and cofounder, on the press call.\u00a0 AeroShield is making materials called aerogels that are clear, lightweight, and fire resistant. They can help make windows 65% more energy efficient, Strobach says.\u00a0 Insulation isn\u2019t always the most exciting topic, but efficiency is one of the best ways to cut down the need for more energy and provide a straightforward way to slash emissions. AeroShield is starting with windows and doors but plans to explore other projects like retrofitting windows and producing insulation for freezer and refrigerator doors, Strobach said on the call. The $14.5 million award will help build a pilot manufacturing facility.",
    "These projects cover a huge range of businesses, from transportation and buildings to heavy industry. The one thing they have in common? All urgently need to clean up their act if the world is going to address climate change. Each of these awards is a big vote of confidence from an agency that\u2019s had a lot of experience in energy technology\u2014but what really matters is what these companies do with the money now.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading I spoke with ARPA-E director Evelyn Wang last year about how the agency hopes to shape the future of energy technology.",
    "To see why readers chose thermal batteries as the 11th Breakthrough Technology, check out this story from April. Cement is one of climate\u2019s hardest problems, as I covered in a feature story about startup Sublime Systems earlier this year.  STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | ENVATO   Another thing There\u2019s a growing pool of money for scientists exploring whether we can reflect away more sunlight to ease warming caused by climate change.\u00a0 Quadrature Climate Foundation is among the organizations providing millions of dollars for research into solar geoengineering. This sort of funding can help scientists pursue lab work, modeling, and maybe even outdoor experiments that could improve our understanding of the often controversial field.\u00a0 For more on where the money is coming from and how this might affect our efforts to address climate change, check out my colleague James Temple\u2019s story here.\u00a0 One more issue We often talk about tech that\u2019s serious business\u2014but technology also has a huge effect on how we have fun. That\u2019s the idea behind our latest print edition, the Play issue.",
    "For the issue, I wrote about board games that take on the topic of climate change. Are they accurate about the challenge ahead, and crucially, can they be fun? Check out my take here. (For a more in-depth look at one particular game, a new climate-themed Catan, give this newsletter a read.)\u00a0 I\u2019d also highly recommend this feature from my colleague Eileen Guo, who looked into the growing business of surf pools\u2014facilities that bring a usually ocean-based activity onto land. She gave one a spin, and considered how these spots affect places facing water scarcity.\u00a0 The whole issue is great\u2014find all the stories here.\u00a0 Keeping up with climate\u00a0\u00a0 A new startup will take sodium sulfate, a waste material from manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, and turn it into chemicals that can go into new batteries. Aepnus Technology calls its approach a \u201cfully circular\u201d one. (Heatmap)",
