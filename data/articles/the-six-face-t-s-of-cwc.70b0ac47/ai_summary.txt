This article is a tribute to the late Arumugan Thondaman, former Cabinet Minister and leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), on what would have been his 60th birthday. Thondaman passed away four days before his 56th birthday on May 26, 2020, due to a cardiac arrest. The article highlights Thondaman's political career and personal life.

Thondaman was a prominent political leader in Sri Lanka and was elected to Parliament from the Nuwara-Eliya district continuously from 1994 to 2015. His only son, Jeevan Thondaman, was elected an MP after his father's demise and is currently a cabinet minister in the Ranil Wickremesinghe Government. Thondaman's nephew, Senthil Thondaman, was a minister in the Uva provincial council.

Contrary to charges of nepotism, the article suggests that Thondaman was not initially interested in politics. He returned from the US, where he had studied business management, to run several businesses and didn't enter politics until his grandfather, who had a key role in Sri Lankan politics, encouraged him. He eventually became a reliable figure within CWC and served as a Cabinet minister under several administrations. 

The six categories the article divides Thondaman's life into are: party leader, trade union leader, parliamentary legislator, cabinet minister, loyal friend, and devoted family man.
