While DOGE\u2019s efforts to shutter federal agencies dominate news from Washington, the Trump administration is also making more global moves. Many of these center on China. Tariffs on goods from the country went into effect last week. There\u2019s also been a minor foreign relations furor since DeepSeek\u2019s big debut a few weeks ago. China has already displayed its dominance in electric vehicles, robotaxis, and drones, and the launch of the new model seems to add AI to the list. This caused the US president as well as some lawmakers to push for new export controls on powerful chips, and three states have now banned the use of DeepSeek on government devices.\u00a0  Now our intrepid China reporter, Caiwei Chen, has identified a new trend unfolding within China\u2019s tech scene: Companies that were dominant in electric vehicles are betting big on translating that success into developing humanoid robots. I spoke with her about what she found out and what it might mean for Trump\u2019s policies and the rest of the globe.\u00a0 James: Before we talk about robots, let\u2019s talk about DeepSeek. The frenzy for the AI model peaked a couple of weeks ago. What are you hearing from other Chinese AI companies? How are they reacting?",
    "Caiwei: I think other Chinese AI companies are scrambling to figure out why they haven\u2019t built a model as strong as DeepSeek\u2019s, despite having access to as much funding and resources. DeepSeek\u2019s success has sparked self-reflection on management styles and renewed confidence in China\u2019s engineering talent. There\u2019s also strong enthusiasm for building various applications on top of DeepSeek\u2019s models. Your story looks at electric-vehicle makers in China that are starting to work on humanoid robots, but I want to ask about a crazy stat. In China, 53% of vehicles sold are either electric or hybrid, compared with 8% in the US. What explains that?",
    "Price is a huge factor\u2014there are countless EV brands competing at different price points, making them both affordable and high-quality. Government incentives also play a big role. In Beijing, for example, trading in an old car for an EV gets you 10,000 RMB (about $1,500), and that subsidy was recently doubled. Plus, finding public charging and battery-swapping infrastructure is much less of a hassle than in the US. You open your story noting that China\u2019s recent New Year Gala, watched by billions of people, featured a cast of humanoid robots, dancing and twirling handkerchiefs. We\u2019ve covered how sometimes humanoid videos can be misleading. What did you think?\u00a0 I would say I was relatively impressed\u2014the robots showed good agility and synchronization with the music, though their movements were simpler than human dancers\u2019. The one trick that is supposed to impress the most is the part where they twirl the handkerchief with one finger, toss it into the air, and then catch it perfectly. This is the signature of the Yangko dance, and having performed it once as a child, I can attest to how difficult the trick is even for a human! There was some skepticism on the Chinese internet about how this was achieved and whether they used additional reinforcement like a magnet or a string to secure the handkerchief, and after watching the clip too many times, I tend to agree.

    "President Trump has already imposed tariffs on China and is planning even more. What could the implications be for China\u2019s humanoid sector?\u00a0\u00a0  Unitree\u2019s H1 and G1 models are already available for purchase and were showcased at CES this year. Large-scale US deployment isn\u2019t happening yet, but China\u2019s lower production costs make these robots highly competitive. Given that 65% of the humanoid supply chain is in China, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if robotics becomes the next target in the US-China tech war. In the US, humanoid robots are getting lots of investment, but there are plenty of skeptics who say they\u2019re too clunky, finicky, and expensive to serve much use in factory settings. Are attitudes different in China? Skepticism exists in China too, but I think there\u2019s more confidence in deployment, especially in factories. With an aging population and a labor shortage on the horizon, there\u2019s also growing interest in medical and caregiving applications for humanoid robots. DeepSeek revived the conversation about chips and the way the US seeks to control where the best chips end up. How do the chip wars affect humanoid-robot development in China?",
    "Training humanoid robots currently doesn\u2019t demand as much computing power as training large language models, since there isn\u2019t enough physical movement data to feed into models at scale. But as robots improve, they\u2019ll need high-performance chips, and US sanctions will be a limiting factor. Chinese chipmakers are trying to catch up, but it\u2019s a challenge.

AI is bringing them back. In motor neuron diseases, the neurons responsible for sending signals to the body\u2019s muscles, including those used for speaking, are progressively destroyed. It robs people of their voices. But some, including a man in Miami named Jules Rodriguez, are now getting them back: An AI model learned to clone Rodriguez\u2019s voice from recordings.  Why it matters: ElevenLabs, the company that created the voice clone, can do a lot with just 30 minutes of recordings. That\u2019s a huge improvement over AI voice clones from just a few years ago, and it can really boost the day-to-day lives of the people who\u2019ve used the technology. \u201cThis is genuinely AI for good,\u201d says Richard Cave, a speech and language therapist at the Motor Neuron Disease Association in the UK.

(MIT Technology Review) Lessons from the AI Action Summit in Paris Last week, politicians and AI leaders from around the globe went to Paris for an AI Action Summit. While concerns about AI safety have dominated the event in years past, this year was more about deregulation and energy, a trend we\u2019ve seen elsewhere. (The Guardian)\u00a0\u00a0 OpenAI ditches its diversity commitment and adds a statement about \u201cintellectual freedom\u201d Following the lead of other tech companies since the beginning of President Trump\u2019s administration, OpenAI has removed a statement on diversity from its website. It has also updated its model spec\u2014the document outlining the standards of its models\u2014to say that \u201cOpenAI believes in intellectual freedom, which includes the freedom to have, hear, and discuss ideas.\u201d (Insider and Tech Crunch) The Musk-OpenAI battle has been heating up Part of OpenAI is structured as a nonprofit, a legacy of its early commitments to make sure its technologies benefit all. Its recent attempts to restructure that nonprofit have triggered a lawsuit from Elon Musk, who alleges that the move would violate the legal and ethical principles of its nonprofit origins. Last week, Musk offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, in a bid that few people took seriously. Sam Altman dismissed it out of hand. Musk now says he will retract that bid if OpenAI stops its conversion of the nonprofit portion of the company. (Wall Street Journal) hide"
