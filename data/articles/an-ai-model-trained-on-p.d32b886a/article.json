    "A US telecom company trained an AI model on years of inmates\u2019 phone and video calls and is now piloting that model to scan their calls, texts, and emails in the hope of predicting and preventing crimes.\u00a0 Securus Technologies president Kevin Elder told MIT Technology Review that the company began building its AI tools in 2023, using its massive database of recorded calls to train AI models to detect criminal activity. It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on building other state- or county-specific models.  Over the past year, Elder says, Securus has been piloting the AI tools to monitor inmate conversations in real time. The company declined to specify where this is taking place, but its customers include jails holding people awaiting trial and prisons for those serving sentences. Some of these facilities using Securus technology also have\u00a0agreements\u00a0with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants, though Securus does not contract with ICE directly. \u201cWe can point that large language model at an entire treasure trove [of data],\u201d Elder says, \u201cto detect and understand when crimes are being thought about or contemplated, so that you\u2019re catching it much earlier in the cycle.\u201d",
    "As with its other monitoring tools, investigators at detention facilities can deploy the AI features to monitor randomly selected conversations or those of individuals suspected by facility investigators of criminal activity, according to Elder. The model will analyze phone and video calls, text messages, and emails and then flag sections for human agents to review. These agents then send them to investigators for follow-up.\u00a0 In an interview, Elder said Securus\u2019 monitoring efforts have helped disrupt human trafficking and gang activities organized from within prisons, among other crimes, and said its tools are also used to identify prison staff who are bringing in contraband. But the company did not provide MIT Technology Review with any cases specifically uncovered by its new AI models.",
    "People in prison, and those they call, are notified that their conversations are recorded. But this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re aware that those conversations could be used to train an AI model, says Bianca Tylek, executive director of the prison rights advocacy group Worth Rises.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s coercive consent; there\u2019s literally no other way you can communicate with your family,\u201d Tylek says. And since inmates in the vast majority of states pay for these calls, she adds, \u201cnot only are you not compensating them for the use of their data, but you\u2019re actually charging them while collecting their data.\u201d Related StoryHow a new type of AI is helping police skirt facial recognition bansRead next A Securus spokesperson said the use of data to train the tool \"is not focused on surveilling or targeting specific individuals, but rather on identifying broader patterns, anomalies, and unlawful behaviors across the entire communication system.\" They added that correctional facilities determine their own recording and monitoring policies, which Securus follows, and did not directly answer whether inmates can opt out of having their recordings used to train AI. Other advocates for inmates say Securus has a history of violating their civil liberties. For example, leaks of its recordings databases showed the company had improperly recorded thousands of calls between inmates and their attorneys. Corene Kendrick, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project, says that the new AI system enables a system of invasive surveillance, and courts have specified few limits to this power.  \u201c[Are we] going to stop crime before it happens because we\u2019re monitoring every utterance and thought of incarcerated people?\u201d Kendrick says. \u201cI think this is one of many situations where the technology is way far ahead of the law.\u201d The company spokesperson said the tool's function is to make monitoring more efficient amid staffing shortages, \u201cnot to surveil individuals without cause.\u201d Securus will have an easier time funding its AI tool thanks to the company\u2019s recent win in a battle with regulators over how telecom companies can spend the money they collect from inmates\u2019 calls. In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission issued a major reform, shaped and lauded by advocates for prisoners\u2019 rights, that forbade telecoms from passing the costs of recording and surveilling calls on to inmates. Companies were allowed to continue to charge inmates a capped rate for calls, but prisons and jails were ordered to pay for most security costs out of their own budgets.",
    "Negative reactions to this change were swift. Associations of sheriffs (who typically run county jails) complained they could no longer afford proper monitoring of calls, and attorneys general from 14 states sued over the ruling. Some prisons and jails warned they would cut off access to phone calls.\u00a0 While it was building and piloting its AI tool, Securus held meetings with the FCC and lobbied for a rule change, arguing that the 2024 reform went too far and asking that the agency again allow companies to use fees collected from inmates to pay for security.\u00a0 In June, Brendan Carr, whom President Donald Trump appointed to lead the FCC, said it would postpone all deadlines for jails and prisons to adopt the 2024 reforms, and even signaled that the agency wants to help telecom companies fund their AI surveillance efforts with the fees paid by inmates. In a press release, Carr wrote that rolling back the 2024 reforms would \u201clead to broader adoption of beneficial public safety tools that include advanced AI and machine learning.\u201d On October 28, the agency went further: It voted to pass new, higher rate caps and allow companies like Securus to pass security costs relating to recording and monitoring of calls\u2014like storing recordings, transcribing them, or building AI tools to analyze such calls, for example\u2014on to inmates.\u00a0A spokesperson for Securus told MIT Technology Review that the company aims to balance affordability with the need to fund essential safety and security tools. \u201cThese tools, which include our advanced monitoring and AI capabilities, are fundamental to maintaining secure facilities for incarcerated individuals and correctional staff and to protecting the public,\u201d they wrote. FCC commissioner Anna Gomez dissented in last month\u2019s ruling. \u201cLaw enforcement,\u201d she wrote in a statement, \u201cshould foot the bill for unrelated security and safety costs, not the families of incarcerated people.\u201d The FCC will be seeking comment on these new rules before they take final effect.\u00a0 This story was updated on December 2 to clarify that Securus does not contract with ICE facilities.  hide"
