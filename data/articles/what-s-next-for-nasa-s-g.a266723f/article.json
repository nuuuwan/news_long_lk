    "MIT Technology Review\u2019s What\u2019s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them\u00a0here. NASA\u2019s huge lunar rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), might be in trouble. As rival launchers like SpaceX\u2019s Starship gather pace, some are questioning the need for the US national space agency to have its own mega rocket at all\u2014something that could become a focus of the incoming Trump administration, in which SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is set to play a key role.  \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely in Elon Musk\u2019s interest to convince the government to cancel SLS,\u201d says Laura Forczyk from the US space consulting firm Astralytical. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not up to him.\u201d SLS has been in development for more than a decade. The rocket is huge, 322 feet (98 meters) tall, and about 15% more powerful than the Saturn V rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 70s. It is also expensive, costing an estimated $4.1 billion per launch.",
    "It was designed with a clear purpose\u2014returning astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface. Built to launch NASA\u2019s human-carrying Orion spacecraft, the rocket is a key part of the agency\u2019s Artemis program to go back to the Moon, started by the previous Trump administration in 2019. \u201cIt has an important role to play,\u201d says Daniel Dumbacher, formerly a deputy associate administrator at NASA and part of the team that selected SLS for development in 2010. \u201cThe logic for SLS still holds up.\u201d Related StoryInside NASA\u2019s bid to make spacecraft as small as possibleWhen it comes to exploring the solar system, we must grapple with the hard limits of physics.",
    "The rocket has launched once already on the Artemis I mission in 2022, a test flight that saw an uncrewed Orion spacecraft sent around the moon. Its next flight, Artemis II, earmarked for September 2025, will be the same flight but with a four-person crew, before the first lunar landing, Artemis III, currently set for September 2026.",
    "SLS could launch missions to other destinations too. At one stage NASA intended to launch its Europa Clipper spacecraft to Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa using SLS, but cost and delays saw the mission launch instead on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in October this year. It has also been touted to launch parts of NASA\u2019s new lunar space station, Gateway, beginning in 2028. The station is currently in development. NASA\u2019s plan to return to the moon involves using SLS to launch astronauts to lunar orbit on Orion, where they will rendezvous with a separate lander to descend to the surface. At the moment that lander will be SpaceX\u2019s Starship vehicle, a huge reusable shuttle intended to launch and land multiple times. Musk wants this rocket to one day take humans to Mars. Starship is currently undergoing testing. Last month, it completed a stunning flight in which the lower half of the rocket, the Super Heavy booster, was caught by SpaceX\u2019s \u201cchopstick\u201d launch tower in Boca Chica, Texas. The rocket is ultimately more powerful than SLS and designed to be entirely reusable, whereas NASA\u2019s rocket is discarded into the ocean after each launch. The success of Starship and the development of other large commercial rockets, such as the Jeff Bezos-owned firm Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket, has raised questions about the need for SLS. In October, billionaire Michael Bloomberg called the rocket a \u201ccolossal waste of taxpayer money\u201d. In November, journalist Eric Berger said there was at least a 50-50 chance the rocket would be canceled.  \u201cI think it would be the right call,\u201d says Abhishek Tripathi, a former mission director at SpaceX now at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to point to SLS as being necessary.\u201d The calculations are not straightforward, however. Dumbacher notes that while SpaceX is making \u201cgreat progress\u201d on Starship, there is much yet to do. The rocket will need to launch possibly up to 18 times to transfer fuel to a single lunar Starship in Earth orbit that can then make the journey to the moon. The first test of this fuel transfer is expected next year. SLS, conversely, can send Orion to the moon in a single launch. That means the case for SLS is only diminished \u201cif the price of 18 Starship launches is less than an SLS launch\u201d, says Dumbacher. SpaceX was awarded $2.9 billion by NASA in 2021 for the first Starship mission to the moon on Artemis III, but the exact cost per launch is unknown.  MICHAEL DEMOCKER/NASA   NASA is also already developing hardware for future SLS launches. \u201cAll elements for the second SLS for Artemis II have been delivered,\u201d a NASA spokesperson said in response to emailed questions, adding that SLS also has \u201chardware in production\u201d for Artemis III, IV, and V.",
    "\u201cSLS can deliver more payload to the moon, in a single launch, than any other rocket,\u201d NASA said. \u201cThe rocket is needed and designed to meet the agency\u2019s lunar transportation requirements.\u201d Dumbacher points out that if the US wants to return to the moon before China sends humans there, which the nation has said it would do by 2030, canceling SLS could be a setback. \u201cNow is not the time to have a major relook at what\u2019s the best rocket,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery minute we delay, we are setting ourselves up for a situation where China will be putting people on the moon first.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has given Musk a role in his incoming administration to slash public spending as part of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency. While the exact remit of this initiative is not yet clear, projects like SLS could be up for scrutiny. Canceling SLS would require support from Congress, however, where Republicans will have only a slim majority. \u201cSLS has been bipartisan and very popular,\u201d says Forczyk, meaning it might be difficult to take any immediate action. \u201cMoney given to SLS is a benefit to taxpayers and voters in key congressional districts [where development of the rocket takes place],\u201d says Forczyk. \u201cWe do not know how much influence Elon Musk will have.\u201d It seems likely the rocket will at least launch Artemis II next September, but beyond that there is more uncertainty. \u201cThe most logical course of action in my mind is to cancel SLS after Artemis III,\u201d says Forczyk. Such a scenario could have a broad impact on NASA that reaches beyond just SLS. Scrapping the rocket could bring up wider discussions about NASA\u2019s overall budget, currently set at $25.4 billion, the highest-funded space agency in the world. That money is used for a variety of science including astrophysics, astronomy, climate studies, and the exploration of the solar system. \u201cIf you cancel SLS, you\u2019re also canceling the broad support for NASA\u2019s budget at its current level,\u201d says Tripathi. \u201cOnce that budget gets slashed, it\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019ll ever grow back to present levels. Be careful what you wish for.\u201d  hide"
