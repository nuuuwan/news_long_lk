    "For business leaders, especially at relatively small companies, the idea of applying gen AI to strategic planning is mouthwatering. \u00a0This article explores the potential and limits of AI in helping such companies chart their strategies. \u00a0Through the lens of two disguised...more",
    "The business community is all atwitter at the prospect that gen AI \u2014 through the likes of ChatGPT, you.com, and Claude.ai \u2014 will revolutionize business decision-making. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, even declared \u201cyou are about to enter the greatest golden age of human possibility.\u201d",
    "For business leaders, the idea of applying gen AI to strategic planning is mouthwatering. One manager recently exclaimed that he couldn\u2019t wait for the time when \u201cAI can help identify opportunities that don\u2019t exist yet!\u201d",
    "But is there a chance we\u2019re overestimating gen AI\u2019s capabilities? How do we identify the areas, if any, where gen AI can boost strategic planning? Are all gen AI tools the same, or are some of them more capable in certain scenarios?",
    "To answer these questions, we detail two business cases involving activities central to strategic planning. (Note: The names have been changed.)",
    "Overcoming Blind Spots and Predicting the Future",
    "Keith is CEO of Trident, a commercial agricultural research organization with 120 staff. Trident is the dominant player in its field of independent contractors. Its clients engage the company to conduct trials to improve cereal, vegetable, and fruit cultivation.",
    "Keith called together his executive team of five for their annual strategy retreat. As Keith explained, \u201cthis gives us a chance to sit back and evaluate things. Usually, we\u2019re on the hop keeping up with trials and reporting their results. It\u2019s relentless.\u201d",
    "One step in the process involved listing the \u201ckey strategic issues\u201d that Trident faced. As Keith explained \u201cthese give us a springboard for our deliberations. Our strategic plan must address these issues.\u201d",
    "Branch number and location",
    "While Keith and his team were happy with their list, they recognized they had a limited perspective. Keith reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re agricultural scientists. We know our game, but we don\u2019t know any others. I\u2019m wondering if gen AI might be able to help with that.\u201d",
    "Keith also wondered about the future. \u201cCan gen AI help us forecast future demand for our services?\u201d",
    "How Gen AI Can \u2014 and Can\u2019t \u2014 help.",
    "Keith raised two highly relevant questions that we often hear from strategic planning teams.",
    "The first of these concerns bias, i.e., having a blinkered view based on a team\u2019s professional training and industry experience. Keith wants to tap into a viewpoint outside agricultural science to produce a fresh perspective. To do this, he could replace several of his executives with others from outside his industry. However, this is hardly practical. An alternative is to employ gen AI. We assisted him with the following prompt:",
    "We\u2019re a commercial agricultural research organization. With 120 staff, we are the dominant player in our field of independent contractors. Our clients engage us to conduct a wide range of field trials of cereals, vegetables and fruit. What are the key strategic issues we\u2019re likely to face in the future?",
    "The response contained nine headings. Under each were two action points. Was there anything new? Yes. But there were also omissions.",
    "The gen AI tool didn\u2019t pick up two items on Keith\u2019s team\u2019s list. These were \u201cbranch number and location\u201d and \u201cprofitability.\u201d Branch location is a very specific issue to Trident and gen AI can hardly be expected to know about that. Not mentioning \u201cprofitability\u201d is, we think, a big miss. Also, while gen AI picked \u201ccompetition\u201d as one of its nine issues it didn\u2019t mention the critical issue of \u201cproduct pricing.\u201d It is a critical issue in this industry as work is won on a tender basis.",
    "ChatGPT\u2019s underlying large language model, though trained on vast data, lacks access to company-specific information, explaining some omissions. Keith should note that these systems are \u201cnon-deterministic,\u201d meaning each response may differ. To mitigate this, Keith could regenerate responses to see alternative answers (in ChatGPT, press ChatGPT under the initial response). We also found that asking gen AI tools to simply \u201cprovide 10 more ideas\u201d helps create a long list and avoids such blatant omissions.",
    "On the positive side, gen AI presented four important areas that Keith\u2019s team missed: \u201ctechnological advancements,\u201d \u201cregulatory changes,\u201d \u201cclient demand and expectations,\u201d and \u201cfunding and investment.\u201d All of these are pertinent to Trident\u2019s business strategy. So, on Keith\u2019s first question (can AI provide a non-agricultural perspective?), we decided that gen AI had succeeded. It helped Keith\u2019s team with divergent thinking, a key skill in any successful transformative team.",
    "Keith\u2019s second question, \u201cCan AI forecast future demand for our services?\u201d proved more challenging for gen AI. While gen AI is a sophisticated technology, it cannot predict the future. This is because gen AI tools are loaded and trained on historical data. The question requires looking forward, not backward, for making projections about the bottom line, such as future sales figures or achievable growth. Here the experience of Keith\u2019s team provides the best predictions, and this requires each member of his team to have their antennae out.",
    "However, with clever prompting, gen AI tools can provide the team with food for thought. We framed the prompt as \u201cWhat will impact the future demand for our services?\u201d The tool highlighted seven factors, from \u201csustainability and climate change\u201d to \u201cchanging consumer preferences\u201d and \u201cglobal population growth.\u201d These drivers help Keith\u2019s team think more broadly about demand.",
    "Addressing Trends and Developing Scenarios",
    "Angeline is the CEO of Fitzroy Cemetery and Crematorium. The strategic planning exercise she organized involved her and her executive team of seven coming together over two days to develop the organization\u2019s five-year strategic plan.",
    "Angeline\u2019s business is government-owned, and while nonprofit, must balance its books. Its main site covers 145 acres of well-maintained ground and provides burial plots, a crematorium, three large chapels, a florist, a caf\u00e9, and function centers.",
    "One important step in the process was to identify \u201cindustry changes and trends.\u201d To broaden ideas Angeline invited Fitzroy Cemetery and Crematorium\u2019s board of six to join her executive team. \u201cThey don\u2019t hold internal executive positions and can provide a fresh perspective,\u201d she explained. The group came up with this list of industry changes and trends:",
    "Shift from burials to cremations",
    "Increased demand for first-class function centers and catering on site",
    "A competitor buying other funeral directors and cemeteries",
    "Shortage of suitable land for future expansion",
    "Families and funeral directors requiring a wider range of video and audio facilities",
    "Growth in different forms of cremation and burial that are more environmentally friendly",
    "While Angeline was satisfied with the outcome, she wondered how gen AI might assist in addressing these changes and trends. She had two questions: 1) Did her team\u2019s list reflect the current trends in the industry? And 2) what was the likely future for the industry, given the shortage of land and the increased interest in environmental practices?",
    "How gen AI can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 help.",
    "To help Fitzroy with the first question, we gave a gen AI tool the list developed by Angeline\u2019s team and asked: \u201cAct as a strategic management consultant. Based on industry challenges, provide recommendations on what is missing from the list relevant to our business strategy?\u201d",
    "While the tool offered a few recommendations of trends that covered what Angeline\u2019s team had considered, it also posed four that were more \u201cthought-provoking\u201d and worthy of consideration by the team:",
    "Aging population and changing demographics",
    "Mental health and grief support",
    "Price sensitivity and transparency",
    "Regulatory changes and compliance",
    "Angeline noted that \u201cthe additional suggestions will help us design our strategy for the future\u201d.",
    "We framed the prompt for the second question as: \u201cIf there was no more land available for burials, what could other alternatives be?\u201d",
    "The results were intriguing and a bit laughable with suggestions such as \u201claunching cremated remains into orbit or deep space\u201d and \u201cusing liquid nitrogen to freeze and vibrate the body into particles.\u201d However, there were some good suggestions too, such as \u201cemploying multi-story buildings for burials\u201d and \u201ccreating memorial forests instead of traditional cemeteries.\u201d These offered alternative out-of-the-box suggestions for Fitzroy Cemetery and Crematorium to consider in the long term.",
    "Some gen AI tools, such as you.com, offer \u201cretrieval augmented generation,\u201d or RAG, blending large language model outputs with most-current internet data. This approach provides up-to-date information and can potentially incorporate internal company data, addressing issues like those in Keith\u2019s case. However, such capabilities require organization-specific deployment. Public tools like ChatGPT or Claude.ai currently lack this feature.",
    "If RAG were available for this case, Claude3 could potentially provide more industry-specific and up-to-date suggestions for land-use alternatives, incorporating recent innovations in sustainable burial practices and local regulatory changes. Thus, Angeline would have more relevant and actionable insights for her strategic planning.",
    "While gen AI offers significant advantages, it\u2019s crucial that you recognize its limitations for strategic planning. These come from the way gen AI works. It sifts through vast amounts of data and sentence completes as it goes with the most probable next word. While this is remarkable, in essence it\u2019s backward looking.",
    "However, knowing gen AI\u2019s weaknesses allows you to take advantage of its strengths. It can enhance your ability to identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust strategy by dropping in some outside-the-box suggestions that may not have come immediately to mind. These must always be filtered with human discernment, but since the tool is so fast and cheap, why not give it a run?",
    "The key is to view gen AI as a tool that augments, rather than replaces, your strategic thinking and decision-making.",
