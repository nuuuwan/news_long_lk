Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi, known for his protest songs criticising Iran's societal issues, has been sentenced to death as part of the regime's crackdown on dissent. This follows the nationwide "Women, Life, Freedom" protests sparked by the killing of Jina Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for not covering her head, who died in police custody. She was posthumously awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Toomaj is known for rap songs such as ‘Mouse Hole’, ‘Turkmenchay’ and ‘Pomegranate’, that challenge the regime. He continued to produce music despite being arrested, tortured and forced to give confessions.
Besides Toomaj, another Kurdish-Iranian rapper Saman Yasin, who was also involved in the 2022 protests, has been sentenced to five years in prison. These rappers, among others, have been targeted by the government for expressing their opposition. The United Nations experts and politicians from around the world are urging Iran to reverse Toomaj's death sentence.
