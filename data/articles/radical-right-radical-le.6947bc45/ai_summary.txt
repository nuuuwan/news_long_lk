Opinions:

- The Indo-Lanka land bridge project is viewed as a potential threat to Sri Lanka's sovereignty.
- The Cardinal believes that the idea for the Indo-Lanka land bridge project originated from foreign requests, not from the needs of the Sri Lankan people.
- The authors of the article suggest that former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is trying to lock Sri Lanka into arrangements that are inconsistent with national interests.
- The article implies a criticism of Wickremesinghe’s support of the Indian projects, portraying it as a method of forcing Sri Lanka into a level of connectivity that the Sri Lankan people did not agree to.
- The authors suggest that the PSA’s views on India are enlightened but also overly generous, as they seem to differentiate between the expansionist tendencies of the Indian government and the democratic struggles of the Indian people.
