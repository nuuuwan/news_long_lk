    "Across elite schools in Colombo and the quietest corners of rural Sri Lanka, a hidden emergency is growing. Children are being groomed, manipulated, and extorted online. The only common factor? Access to a smart device \u2014 often handed over by a well-meaning adult, unaware of the danger on the other side of the screen.",
    "At Child Protection Force (CPF), we\u2019ve worked with children as young as 10 who have fallen victim to online predators. This is not just a city issue. Wherever there is Wi-Fi, there is risk. The predators know it \u2014 and they are often far more digitally skilled than the adults trying to protect these children.",
    "How online grooming works",
    "It often starts with a seemingly innocent message: a compliment on a photo, a follow request, a friend invite on a game. Once a child responds, the predator slowly builds trust, sometimes over weeks or even months. Then comes the turning point \u2014 the request for private images. Once shared, the threats begin: \u201cSend more or I\u2019ll share these with your friends and family.\u201d",
    "This is not a rare story. It\u2019s happening every day \u2014 to schoolchildren who don\u2019t even fully understand what\u2019s happening, until it\u2019s too late.",
    "Where the system is failing",
    "When these crimes are reported, the system that should respond simply doesn\u2019t. Not because of malice \u2014 but because of neglect, delay, and chronic under-resourcing.",
    "Reports to the CID\u2019s Computer Crimes Division can take up to three months to even receive acknowledgment. One young girl CPF supported was asked to \u201creconfirm the initial complaint\u201d after 90 days \u2014 despite her daily fear that her images would be shared. And this is not to blame that individual officer, we know and work with officers who work tirelessly. They receive over 50-60 complaints a day, an unofficial source said.",
    "The Police Women and Children\u2019s Bureau recently launched an email complaint mechanism. Yet we were once informed, \u201cThe officer who checks the email isn\u2019t in today.\u201d An insane response to a person at the risk of self-harm.",
    "Even the act of reporting is traumatising",
    "At the CID headquarters, survivors are made to walk through a notorious corridor \u2014the \u201cpassage of doom.\u201d It\u2019s narrow, unlit, damp, mosquito-ridden, and degrading. A leftover from another era, perhaps designed to intimidate perpetrators \u2014 but today it retraumatises victims, and not that the State is unable to fund the construction of it, we\u2019re sure.",
    "We recently accompanied a survivor who waited 25 minutes in that corridor, only to be told she could hand her written complaint to the guard and would be contacted later. Because we knew the system, we had brought a printed complaint. Most don\u2019t \u2014 and they\u2019re left to handwrite theirs in that awful corridor, under stress, with no privacy.",
    "Law enforcement officers are doing their best \u2014 but with no tools",
    "We want to be clear: this is not about individual officers failing in their duty. Most are doing their best, with empathy and dedication \u2014 but without even basic tools. Many are forced to use personal phones to investigate these crimes. Let that sink in.",
    "No Government-issued devices.",
    "No dedicated data analysis tools.",
    "No proper forensic equipment.",
    "These limitations mean that evidence is often compromised, cases are thrown out on technicalities, and perpetrators walk free.",
    "The fault lies not with officers \u2014 but with a continuous Government in power that underfunds and disregards child protection infrastructure, while spending millions elsewhere. Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t need another cricket stadium. We need systems that protect our children.",
    "A recent win \u2013 against all odds",
    "Despite these odds, CPF recently secured justice for a young girl who had been manipulated and extorted online. Our legal team, led by Senior Legal Consultants, supported her through every stage. Thanks to tireless advocacy and skilled representation, a guilty plea was secured and compensation was awarded. The judiciary played a commendable role, issuing a stern warning to the accused while also emphasising the importance of rehabilitation and appropriate support.",
    "This is one of the very few such convictions in Sri Lanka \u2014 and a reminder that with proper support, justice is possible.",
    "It\u2019s time for urgent reform",
    "Online abuse is a national crisis. It is a form of child sexual violence \u2014 and should be treated with that level of seriousness.",
    "Survivor-friendly and trauma-informed reporting mechanisms.",
    "Rapid response units trained in digital crimes against children.",
    "Proper resourcing and equipment for law enforcement.",
    "Public education for parents and schools.",
    "Until these changes happen, we will continue to fight \u2014 case by case, child by child.",
    "If you or someone you know is facing online exploitation, please reach out. At CPF, we are here to help.",
