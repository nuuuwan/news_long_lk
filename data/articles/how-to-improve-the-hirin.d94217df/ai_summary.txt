Facts:

- Despite increased employment gains for disabled employees in the U.S., hiring still presents challenges for both candidates and companies. 
- Companies express their commitment to diversity and inclusion through personalized language in job advertisements and websites instead of standard boilerplate statements.
- Researchers tested two versions of the same job advertisement with different Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) statements and found that disabled job candidates responded more positively to “heartfelt” language. The positive response was more pronounced when this language was placed at the beginning of the job ad.
- A study explored the efficacy of a personal statement from the CEO, testimonials from disabled employees, and presentation of awards and statistics about the company's DEI efforts. The findings showed disabled job candidates responded positively to the inclusion of these elements and viewed the company more favorably.
- Another study found that disabled job applicants can feel empowered by showcasing their hard skills during the interview and postponing discussions about necessary accommodations to build rapport first.
- Personal assistive devices can increase trust during an interview, but using them doesn't necessarily improve the odds of securing employment.
- A study involving managers reviewing the application of a candidate using a mechanical exosuit found that bias was reduced when a letter of recommendation or an offer for a trial work period was included. 
- The Americans with Disabilities Act recommends companies have discussions with those requesting accommodations.

Opinions:

- Disabled job candidates expressed skepticism about companies' genuine commitment to DEI, as they felt some only "talk the talk" without following through once employment begins.
- Authors suggest improving the DEI signaling in job ads and websites as a starting point for attracting disabled candidates.
- The authors propose the need to invite candidates to make strong initial impressions and reduce bias early in the recruitment process.
- They assert that the mantra "nothing about us, without us" still holds relevance, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity.
- Changes need to address challenges at multiple levels and no single minor adjustment can thoroughly resolve these concerns.
- A reference is made to the opinion that the tide is turning and companies are demonstrating the will to improve.
