Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen, a senior house officer at the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital's Gynaecology and Obstetrics Unit in Sri Lanka, has criticised the former President of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Anuruddha Padeniya, for not defending him when he was falsely accused of forced sterilisations. Speaking at an event organised by the Journalists for Rights Organisation, Shihabdeen, who has been exonerated of all charges, urged unity and compassion, expressed love for his country and discussed his vision for future generations. During the legal ordeal, he was detained alongside criminal Makandure Madhush and noted that he found more humanity in Madhush than in some politicians.
