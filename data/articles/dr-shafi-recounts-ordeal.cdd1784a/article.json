    "Reiterates commitment to providing care to mothers, emphasising that he never harboured any intentions to harm them",
    "Reflects on his detention alongside Makandure Madhush, who he said had no more humanity than those in Parliament today",
    "Kurunegala Teaching Hospital Senior House Officer in the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Unit Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen last week recounted his ordeal and emphasised the need for unity and compassion in Sri Lanka.",
    "He voiced his disappointment with former President of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Anuruddha Padeniya, for remaining silent during Shihabdeen\u2019s wrongful accusation of conducting forced sterilisations on women.",
    "Addressing an event organised by the Journalists for Rights Organisation, Shihabdeen expressed his dismay at Padeniya\u2019s inaction, particularly given Shihabdeen\u2019s role in delivering Padeniya\u2019s second child.",
    "\u201cThe common man regards doctors as akin to Gods. However, Padeniya misused this esteemed profession to deliver us to malevolent forces. We do not need a generation of such persons or the unpleasant memories they create,\u201d Shihabdeen remarked.",
    "\u201cI harbour no hatred towards those who have harmed me. I have forgotten all,\u201d Shihabdeen affirmed. \u201cEven when I was taken away in handcuffs, knowing I had committed no wrong, I remained confident that no harm would befall me,\u201d he added.",
    "Dr. Shihabdeen was serving as a Gynaecologist at the hospital when he was falsely accused and arrested for carrying out forced sterilisations on women on 24 May 2019. He was later exonerated and acquitted of all charges.",
    "Delivering a heartfelt speech Dr. Shihabdeen shared his profound love for the country and his vision for a brighter future for the next generation.",
    "\u201cWe all love this country and we all envision creating a better country for our next generation,\u201d Dr. Shihabdeen began, setting the tone for his impassioned narrative.",
    "Recalling his upbringing in Kalawewa, Vijithapura, Dr. Shihabdeen reminisced about his family\u2019s deep-rooted ties with the Sinhalese community. \u201cMy grandfather taught Pali to the young Samaneras at the Vijithapura Raja Maha Vihara. We are still respected at the Vihara for that,\u201d he shared.",
    "Expressing his concerns for the youth of the country, Dr. Shihabdeen lamented the sight of young people lining up in the early hours to obtain passports, driven by a desire to leave the country due to dire economic conditions. \u201cThey are sleeping on the streets with no food or other facilities,\u201d he observed.",
    "Reflecting on the accusations levelled against him, Dr. Shihabdeen humbly expressed his resolve to stay in Sri Lanka and face the challenges head-on. \u201cFor the crime I faced, if anyone is leaving the country, I should be the first to leave. But I will never do that,\u201d he affirmed,",
    "Amidst his struggles, Dr. Shihabdeen said he found solace in unexpected moments of inspiration. \u201cWhen I was in despair, I believe I got a message from God,\u201d he revealed. \u201cIn a food parcel provided by a policeman, an article by Prof. Hemantha Senanayake appeared in the paper wrapped around the parcel. It had my story in it. It gave me strength to see it,\u201d he recounted.",
    "Dr. Shihabdeen urged unity and compassion in the face of adversity. \u201cWe must all come together and teach the next generation that until the end of this world, there is one group that fights for what is right while there is another group who commits wrongs for their benefit,\u201d he proclaimed, calling for collective action to uphold moral values.",
    "Dr. Shihabdeen expressed confidence that the truth would ultimately prevail, leaving a lasting legacy of resilience and compassion for future generations to emulate. \u201cWe do not need the UK or Japan. Let us create a better country for the future generation where people of all walks of life can have a meal together,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI was detained alongside Makandure Madhush in the same cell at the CID. In that experience, I found a humanity that seems lacking among certain individuals in Parliament today,\u201d he recounted. He noted that he and Madhush shared meals together during their incarceration.",
    "He went on to acknowledge the few who apologised on behalf of the entire Sinhalese community for the injustices he faced. Dr. Shihabdeen recounted an incident where the Head of Surgery at the Colombo Medical Faculty extended such an apology. However, he insisted that not all members of the Sinhalese community were responsible for his ordeal.",
    "Recalling his career beginnings in Kurunegala, Dr. Shihabdeen likened the hospital to his home despite occasional conflicts. He emphasised the importance of unity and perseverance, stating, \u201cLeaving home is not the solution. He suggested everyone must come together and teach the next generation the difference between those who fight for what is right and those who commit wrongs for personal gain.",
    "Expressing his views on religion and humanity, Dr. Shihabdeen stressed the need for genuine compassion and respect for others. \u201cIf a religion preaches destruction instead of compassion, it is not worthy of being followed,\u201d he asserted.",
    "Throughout his career, Dr. Shihabdeen said he never identified himself solely as a Muslim doctor, emphasising his commitment to serving all patients regardless of ethnicity or religion. \u201cTrust was never damaged between staff and patients,\u201d he affirmed, underscoring his dedication to his profession and the community.",
    "\u201cI served over 1,000 mothers during my time as a medical professional. Never once did I entertain the thought of causing harm to any of them,\u201d Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen affirmed. Despite the challenges he faced, he continued to provide compassionate care to countless mothers, earning the gratitude of many. \u201cEven today, some mothers from Kurunegala choose to come to me for their deliveries,\u201d he added. \u201cIn a testament to the inherent goodness of our people, some have even apologised to me for any harm caused by their previous complaints. It is a reflection of the kindness and integrity that exists within our country. We must strive to bring out the best in everyone,\u201d Dr. Shihabdeen said."
