OpenAI's new AI model, GPT-4o, has come under scrutiny after its Chinese-language training data was revealed to be polluted with phrases from Chinese spam websites, many of which are related to pornography and gambling. This has raised concerns about the performance and misuse of the AI model, as well as potentially offensive cultural representations. Many believe this issue reflects the issues with available online data as well as the websites that OpenAI uses for its model training. OpenAI also faces criticism for its lack of data cleaning or creation of its own high quality data sets. The AI company has also been noted for being secretive about its data sources and has not responded to queries about its training database.
