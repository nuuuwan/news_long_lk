    "First, a confession. I only got into playing video games a little over a year ago (I know, I know). A Christmas gift of an Xbox Series S \u201cfor the kids\u201d dragged me\u2014pretty easily, it turns out\u2014into the world of late-night gaming sessions. I was immediately attracted to open-world games, in which you\u2019re free to explore a vast simulated world and choose what challenges to accept. Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), an open-world game set in the Wild West, blew my mind. I rode my horse through sleepy towns, drank in the saloon, visited a vaudeville theater, and fought off bounty hunters. One day I simply set up camp on a remote hilltop to make coffee and gaze down at the misty valley below me. To make them feel alive, open-world games are inhabited by vast crowds of computer-controlled characters. These animated people\u2014called NPCs, for \u201cnonplayer characters\u201d\u2014populate the bars, city streets, or space ports of games. They make these virtual worlds feel lived in and full. Often\u2014but not always\u2014you can talk to them.  ROCKSTAR GAMES   ROCKSTAR GAMES   In open-world games like Red Dead Redemption 2, players can choose diverse interactions within the same simulated experience.  After a while, however, the repetitive chitchat (or threats) of a passing stranger forces you to bump up against the truth: This is just a game. It\u2019s still fun\u2014I had a whale of a time, honestly, looting stagecoaches, fighting in bar brawls, and stalking deer through rainy woods\u2014but the illusion starts to weaken when you poke at it. It\u2019s only natural. Video games are carefully crafted objects, part of a multibillion-dollar industry, that are designed to be consumed. You play them, you loot a few stagecoaches, you finish, you move on.\u00a0 It may not always be like that. Just as it is upending other industries, generative AI is opening the door to entirely new kinds of in-game interactions that are open-ended, creative, and unexpected. The game may not always have to end.",
    "Startups employing generative-AI models, like ChatGPT, are using them to create characters that don\u2019t rely on scripts but, instead, converse with you freely. Others are experimenting with NPCs who appear to have entire interior worlds, and who can continue to play even when you, the player, are not around to watch. Eventually, generative AI could create game experiences that are infinitely detailed, twisting and changing every time you experience them.\u00a0 The field is still very new, but it\u2019s extremely hot. In 2022 the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz launched Games Fund, a $600 million fund dedicated to gaming startups. A huge number of these are planning to use AI in gaming. And the firm, also known as A16Z, has now invested in two studios that are aiming to create their own versions of AI NPCs. A second $600 million round was announced in April 2024.",
    "Related StoryThese six questions will dictate the future of generative AIGenerative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Its future\u2014and ours\u2014will be shaped by what we do next.",
    "Early experimental demos of these experiences are already popping up, and it may not be long before they appear in full games like RDR2. But some in the industry believe this development will not just make future open-world games incredibly immersive; it could change what kinds of game worlds or experiences are even possible. Ultimately, it could change what it means to play. \u201cWhat comes after the video game? You know what I mean?\u201d says Frank Lantz, a game designer and director of the NYU Game Center. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re on the threshold of a new kind of game.\u201d These guys just won\u2019t shut up The way video games are made hasn\u2019t changed much over the years. Graphics are incredibly realistic. Games are bigger. But the way in which you interact with characters, and the game world around you, uses many of the same decades-old conventions. \u201cIn mainstream games, we\u2019re still looking at variations of the formula we\u2019ve had since the 1980s,\u201d says Julian Togelius, a computer science professor at New York University who has a startup called Modl.ai that does in-game testing. Part of that tried-and-tested formula is a technique called a dialogue tree, in which all of an NPC\u2019s possible responses are mapped out. Which one you get depends on which branch of the dialogue tree you have chosen. For example, say something rude about a passing NPC in RDR2 and the character will probably lash out\u2014you have to quickly apologize to avoid a shootout (unless that\u2019s what you want).   In the most expensive, high-\u00adprofile games, the so-called AAA games like Elden Ring or Starfield, a deeper sense of immersion is created by using brute force to build out deep and vast dialogue trees. The biggest studios employ teams of hundreds of game developers who work for many years on a single game in which every line of dialogue is plotted and planned, and software is written so the in-game engine knows when to deploy that particular line. RDR2 reportedly contains an estimated 500,000 lines of dialogue, voiced by around 700 actors.\u00a0 \u201cYou get around the fact that you can [only] do so much in the world by, like, insane amounts of writing, an insane amount of designing,\u201d says Togelius.\u00a0  Generative AI is already helping take some of that drudgery out of making new games. Jonathan Lai, a general partner at A16Z and one of Games Fund\u2019s managers, says that most studios are using image-\u00adgenerating tools like Midjourney to enhance or streamline their work. And in a 2023 survey by A16Z, 87% of game studios said they were already using AI in their workflow in some way\u2014and 99% planned to do so in the future. Many use AI agents to replace the human testers who look for bugs, such as places where a game might crash. In recent months, the CEO of the gaming giant EA said generative AI could be used in more than 50% of its game development processes. Ubisoft, one of the biggest game developers, famous for AAA open-world games such as Assassin\u2019s Creed, has been using a large-\u00adlanguage-model-based AI tool called Ghostwriter to do some of the grunt work for its developers in writing basic dialogue for its NPCs. Ghostwriter generates loads of options for background crowd chatter, which the human writer can pick from or tweak. The idea is to free the humans up so they can spend that time on more plot-focused writing.  GEORGE WYLESOL   Ultimately, though, everything is scripted. Once you spend a certain number of hours on a game, you will have seen everything there is to see, and completed every interaction. Time to buy a new one. But for startups like Inworld AI, this situation is an opportunity. Inworld, based in California, is building tools to make in-game NPCs that respond to a player with dynamic, unscripted dialogue and actions\u2014so they never repeat themselves. The company, now valued at $500 million, is the best-funded AI gaming startup around thanks to backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and other high-profile investors.",
    "Role-playing games give us a unique way to experience different realities, explains Kylan Gibbs, Inworld\u2019s CEO and founder. But something has always been missing. \u201cBasically, the characters within there are dead,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you think about media at large, be it movies or TV or books, characters are really what drive our ability to empathize with the world,\u201d Gibbs says. \u201cSo the fact that games, which are arguably the most advanced version of storytelling that we have, are lacking these live characters\u2014it felt to us like a pretty major issue.\u201d Gamers themselves were pretty quick to realize that LLMs could help fill this gap. Last year, some came up with ChatGPT mods (a way to alter an existing game) for the popular role-playing game Skyrim. The mods let players interact with the game\u2019s vast cast of characters using LLM-powered free chat. One mod even included OpenAI\u2019s speech recognition software Whisper AI so that players could speak to the players with their voices, saying whatever they wanted, and have full conversations that were no longer restricted by dialogue trees.\u00a0 The results gave gamers a glimpse of what might be possible but were ultimately a little disappointing. Though the conversations were open-ended, the character interactions were stilted, with delays while ChatGPT processed each request.\u00a0  Inworld wants to make this type of interaction more polished. It\u2019s offering a product for AAA game studios in which developers can create the brains of an AI NPC that can be then imported into their game. Developers use the company\u2019s \u201cInworld Studio\u201d to generate their NPC. For example, they can fill out a core description that sketches the character\u2019s personality, including likes and dislikes, motivations, or useful backstory. Sliders let you set levels of traits such as introversion or extroversion, insecurity or confidence. And you can also use free text to make the character drunk, aggressive, prone to exaggeration\u2014pretty much anything. Developers can also add descriptions of how their character speaks, including examples of commonly used phrases that Inworld\u2019s various AI models, including LLMs, then spin into dialogue in keeping with the character.\u00a0  \u201cBecause there\u2019s such reliance on a lot of labor-intensive scripting, it\u2019s hard to get characters to handle a wide variety of ways a scenario might play out, especially as games become more and more open-ended.\u201d Jeff Orkin, founder, Bitpart Game designers can also plug other information into the system: what the character knows and doesn\u2019t know about the world (no Taylor Swift references in a medieval battle game, ideally) and any relevant safety guardrails (does your character curse or not?). Narrative controls will let the developers make sure the NPC is sticking to the story and isn\u2019t wandering wildly off-base in its conversation. The idea is that the characters can then be imported into video-game graphics engines like Unity or Unreal Engine to add a body and features. Inworld is collaborating with the text-to-voice startup ElevenLabs to add natural-sounding voices. Inworld\u2019s tech hasn\u2019t appeared in any AAA games yet, but at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco in March 2024, the firm unveiled an early demo with Nvidia that showcased some of what will be possible. In Covert Protocol, each player operates as a private detective who must solve a case using input from the various in-game NPCs. Also at the GDC, Inworld unveiled a demo called NEO NPC that it had worked on with Ubisoft. In NEO NPC, a player could freely interact with NPCs using voice-to-text software and use conversation to develop a deeper relationship with them.",
    "LLMs give us the chance to make games more dynamic, says Jeff Orkin, founder of Bitpart, a new startup that also aims to create entire casts of LLM-powered NPCs that can be imported into games. \u201cBecause there\u2019s such reliance on a lot of labor-intensive scripting, it\u2019s hard to get characters to handle a wide variety of ways a scenario might play out, especially as games become more and more open-ended,\u201d he says. Bitpart\u2019s approach is in part inspired by Orkin\u2019s PhD research at MIT\u2019s Media Lab. There, he trained AIs to role-play social situations using game-play logs of humans doing the same things with each other in multiplayer games.",
    "Bitpart\u2019s casts of characters are trained using a large language model and then fine-tuned in a way that means the in-game interactions are not entirely open-ended and infinite. Instead, the company uses an LLM and other tools to generate a script covering a range of possible interactions, and then a human game designer will select some. Orkin describes the process as authoring the Lego bricks of the interaction. An in-game algorithm searches out specific bricks to string them together at the appropriate time. Bitpart\u2019s approach could create some delightful in-game moments. In a restaurant, for example, you might ask a waiter for something, but the bartender might overhear and join in. Bitpart\u2019s AI currently works with Roblox. Orkin says the company is now running trials with AAA game studios, although he won\u2019t yet say which ones.  But generative AI might do more than just enhance the immersiveness of existing kinds of games. It could give rise to completely new ways to play. Making the impossible possible When I asked Frank Lantz about how AI could change gaming, he talked for 26 minutes straight. His initial reaction to generative AI had been visceral: \u201cI was like, oh my God, this is my destiny and is what I was put on the planet for.\u201d\u00a0 Lantz has been in and around the cutting edge of the game industry and AI for decades but received a cult level of acclaim a few years ago when he created the Universal Paperclips game. The simple in-browser game gives the player the job of producing as many paper clips as possible. It\u2019s a riff on the famous thought experiment by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, which imagines an AI that is given the same task and optimizes against humanity\u2019s interest by turning all the matter in the known universe into paper clips. Lantz is bursting with ideas for ways to use generative AI. One is to experience a new work of art as it is being created, with the player participating in its creation. \u201cYou\u2019re inside of something like Lord of the Rings as it\u2019s being written. You\u2019re inside a piece of literature that is unfolding around you in real time,\u201d he says. He also imagines strategy games where the players and the AI work together to reinvent what kind of game it is and what the rules are, so it is never the same twice.",
    "For Orkin, LLM-powered NPCs can make games unpredictable\u2014and that\u2019s exciting. \u201cIt introduces a lot of open questions, like what you do when a character answers you but that sends a story in a direction that nobody planned for,\u201d he says.\u00a0  Generative A\u200aI might do more than just enhance the immersiveness of existing kinds of games. It could give rise to completely new ways to play.  It might mean games that are unlike anything we\u2019ve seen thus far. Gaming experiences that unspool as the characters\u2019 relationships shift and change, as friendships start and end, could unlock entirely new narrative experiences that are less about action and more about conversation and personalities.\u00a0 Togelius imagines new worlds built to react to the player\u2019s own wants and needs, populated with NPCs that the player must teach or influence as the game progresses. Imagine interacting with characters whose opinions can change, whom you could persuade or motivate to act in a certain way\u2014say, to go to battle with you. \u201cA thoroughly generative game could be really, really good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you really have to change your whole expectation of what a game is.\u201d Lantz is currently working on a prototype of a game in which the premise is that you\u2014the player\u2014wake up dead, and the afterlife you are in is a low-rent, cheap version of a synthetic world. The game plays out like a noir in which you must explore a city full of thousands of NPCs powered by a version of ChatGPT, whom you must interact with to work out how you ended up there.",
    "His early experiments gave him some eerie moments when he felt that the characters seemed to know more than they should, a sensation recognizable to people who have played with LLMs before. Even though you know they\u2019re not alive, they can still freak you out a bit. \u201cIf you run electricity through a frog\u2019s corpse, the frog will move,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you run $10 million worth of computation through the internet \u2026 it moves like a frog, you know.\u201d\u00a0 But these early forays into generative-\u00ad\u00adAI gaming have given him a real sense of excitement for what\u2019s next: \u201cI felt like, okay, this is a thread. There really is a new kind of artwork here.\u201d If an AI NPC talks and no one is around to listen, is there a sound? AI NPCs won\u2019t just enhance player interactions\u2014they might interact with one another in weird ways. Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s NPCs each have long, detailed scripts that spell out exactly where they should go, what work they must complete, and how they\u2019d react if anything unexpected occurred. If you want, you can follow an NPC and watch it go about its day. It\u2019s fun, but ultimately it\u2019s hard-coded. NPCs built with generative AI could have a lot more leeway\u2014even interacting with one another when the player isn\u2019t there to watch. Just as people have been fooled into thinking LLMs are sentient, watching a city of generated NPCs might feel like peering over the top of a toy box that has somehow magically come alive. We\u2019re already getting a sense of what this might look like. At Stanford University, Joon Sung Park has been experimenting with AI-generated characters and watching to see how their behavior changes and gains complexity as they encounter one another.\u00a0 Because large language models have sucked up the internet and social media, they actually contain a lot of detail about how we behave and interact, he says.  Gamers came up with ChatGPT mods for the popular role-playing game Skyrim.COURTESY OF THE DEVELOPERS   Although 2016\u2019s hugely hyped No Man\u2019s Sky used procedural generation to create endless planets to explore, many saw it as a letdown.COURTESY OF THE DEVELOPERS   In Covert Protocol, players operate as private detectives who must solve the case using input from various in-game NPCsCOURTESY OF THE DEVELOPERS     In Park\u2019s recent research, he and colleagues set up a Sims-like game, called Smallville, with 25 simulated characters that had been trained using generative AI. Each was given a name and a simple biography before being set in motion. When left to interact with each other for two days, they began to exhibit humanlike conversations and behavior, including remembering each other and being able to talk about their past interactions.\u00a0  For example, the researchers prompted one character to organize a Valentine\u2019s Day party\u2014and then let the simulation run. That character sent invitations around town, while other members of the community asked each other on dates to go to the party, and all turned up at the venue at the correct time. All of this was carried out through conversations, and past interactions between characters were stored in their \u201cmemories\u201d as natural language. For Park, the implications for gaming are huge. \u201cThis is exactly the sort of tech that the gaming community for their NPCs have been waiting for,\u201d he says.\u00a0 His research has inspired games like AI Town, an open-source interactive experience on GitHub that lets human players interact with AI NPCs in a simple top-down game. You can leave the NPCs to get along for a few days and check in on them, reading the transcripts of the interactions they had while you were away. Anyone is free to take AI Town\u2019s code to build new NPC experiences through AI.\u00a0 Related StoryGoogle is throwing generative AI at everythingBut experts say that releasing these models into the wild before fixing their flaws could prove extremely risky for the company.",
    "For Daniel De Freitas, cofounder of the startup Character AI, which lets users generate and interact with their own LLM-powered characters, the generative-AI revolution will allow new types of games to emerge\u2014ones in which the NPCs don\u2019t even need human players.\u00a0 The player is \u201cjoining an adventure that is always happening, that the AIs are playing,\u201d he imagines. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of joining a theme park full of actors, but unlike the actors, they truly \u2018believe\u2019 that they are in those roles.\u201d If you\u2019re getting Westworld vibes right about now, you\u2019re not alone. There are plenty of stories about people torturing or killing their simple Sims characters in the game for fun. Would mistreating NPCs that pass for real humans cross some sort of new ethical boundary? What if, Lantz asks, an AI NPC that appeared conscious begged for its life when you simulated torturing it? It raises complex questions he adds. \u201cOne is: What are the ethical dimensions of pretend violence? And the other is: At what point do AIs become moral agents to which harm can be done?\u201d There are other potential issues too. An immersive world that feels real, and never ends, could be dangerously addictive. Some users of AI chatbots have already reported losing hours and even days in conversation with their creations. Are there dangers that the same parasocial relationships could emerge with AI NPCs?\u00a0  \u201cWe may need to worry about people forming unhealthy relationships\u00a0with game characters at some point,\u201d says Togelius. Until now, players have been able to differentiate pretty easily between game play and real life. But AI NPCs might change that, he says: \u201cIf at some point what we now call \u2018video games\u2019 morph into some all-encompassing virtual reality, we will probably need to worry about the effect of NPCs being too good, in some sense.\u201d A portrait of the artist as a young bot Not everyone is convinced that never-ending open-ended conversations between the player and NPCs are what we really want for the future of games.\u00a0 \u201cI think we have to be cautious about connecting our imaginations with reality,\u201d says Mike Cook, an AI researcher and game designer. \u201cThe idea of a game where you can go anywhere, talk to anyone, and do anything has always been a dream of a certain kind of player. But in practice, this freedom is often at odds with what we want from a story.\u201d In other words, having to generate a lot of the dialogue yourself might actually get kind of \u2026 well, boring. \u201cIf you can\u2019t think of interesting or dramatic things to say, or are simply too tired or bored to do it, then you\u2019re going to basically be reading your own very bad creative fiction,\u201d says Cook.\u00a0 Orkin likewise doesn\u2019t think conversations that could go anywhere are actually what most gamers want. \u201cI want to play a game that a bunch of very talented, creative people have really thought through and created an engaging story and world,\u201d he says. This idea of authorship is an important part of game play, agrees Togelius. \u201cYou can generate as much as you want,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t guarantee that anything is interesting and worth keeping. In fact, the more content you generate, the more boring it might be.\u201d  GEORGE WYLESOL   Sometimes, the possibility of everything is too much to cope with. No Man\u2019s Sky, a hugely hyped space game launched in 2016 that used algorithms to generate endless planets to explore, was seen by many players as a bit of a letdown when it finally arrived. Players quickly discovered that being able to explore a universe that never ended, with worlds that were endlessly different, actually fell a little flat. (A series of updates over subsequent years has made No Man\u2019s Sky a little more structured, and it\u2019s now generally well thought of.) One approach might be to keep AI gaming experiences tight and focused.  Hilary Mason, CEO at the gaming startup Hidden Door, likes to joke that her work is \u201cartisanal AI.\u201d She is from Brooklyn, after all, says her colleague Chris Foster, the firm\u2019s game director, laughing. Hidden Door, which has not yet released any products, is making role-playing text adventures based on classic stories that the user can steer. It\u2019s like Dungeons & Dragons for the generative AI era. It stitches together classic tropes for certain adventure worlds, and an annotated database of thousands of words and phrases, and then uses a variety of machine-learning tools, including LLMs, to make each story unique. Players walk through a semi-\u00adunstructured storytelling experience, free-typing into text boxes to control their character.\u00a0 The result feels a bit like hand-annotating an AI-generated novel with Post-it notes. In a demo with Mason, I got to watch as her character infiltrated a hospital and attempted to hack into the server. Each suggestion prompted the system to spin up the next part of the story, with the large language model creating new descriptions and in-game objects on the fly. Each experience lasts between 20 and 40 minutes, and for Foster, it creates an \u201cexpressive canvas\u201d that people can play with. The fixed length and the added human touch\u2014Mason\u2019s artisanal approach\u2014give players \u201csomething really new and magical,\u201d he says. There\u2019s more to life than games Park thinks generative AI that makes NPCs feel alive in games will have other, more fundamental implications further down the line. \u201cThis can, I think, also change the meaning of what games are,\u201d he says.\u00a0 For example, he\u2019s excited about using generative-AI agents to simulate how real people act. He thinks AI agents could one day be used as proxies for real people to, for example, test out the likely reaction to a new economic policy. Counterfactual scenarios could be plugged in that would let policymakers run time backwards to try to see what would have happened if a different path had been taken.\u00a0 Related StoryAn early guide to policymaking on generative AIHow lawmakers are thinking about the risks of the latest tech revolution",
    "\u201cYou want to learn that if you implement this social policy or economic policy, what is going to be the impact that it\u2019s going to have on the target population?\u201d he suggests. \u201cWill there be unexpected side effects that we\u2019re not going to be able to foresee on day one?\u201d And while Inworld is focused on adding immersion to video games, it has also worked with LG in South Korea to make characters that kids can chat with to improve their English language skills. Others are using Inworld\u2019s tech to create interactive experiences. One of these, called Moment in Manzanar, was created to help players empathize with the Japanese-Americans the US government detained in internment camps during World War II. It allows the user to speak to a fictional character called Ichiro who talks about what it was like to be held in the Manzanar camp in California.\u00a0 Inworld\u2019s NPC ambitions might be exciting for gamers (my future excursions as a cowboy could be even more immersive!), but there are some who believe using AI to enhance existing games is thinking too small. Instead, we should be leaning into the weirdness of LLMs to create entirely new kinds of experiences that were never possible before, says Togelius. The shortcomings of LLMs \u201care not bugs\u2014they\u2019re features,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Lantz agrees. \u201cYou have to start with the reality of what these things are and what they do\u2014this kind of latent space of possibilities that you\u2019re surfing and exploring,\u201d he says. \u201cThese engines already have that kind of a psychedelic quality to them. There\u2019s something trippy about them. Unlocking that is the thing that I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Whatever is next, we probably haven\u2019t even imagined it yet, Lantz thinks.\u00a0 \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s not about a simulated world with pretend characters in it at all,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s something totally different. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m excited to find out.\u201d hide"
