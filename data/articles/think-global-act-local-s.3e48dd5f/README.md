Reducing food loss and waste can be the lever that connects food security, economic growth, and climate action

In a region where millions still face hunger and malnutrition, it is concerning that South Asia also loses a significant share of its food before it ever reaches the plate. Over 30% of all food in the region is lost or wasted each year, which is enough to feed nearly 300 million people. From farm to fork, food loss and waste undermine nutrition, hurt farmers’ incomes, fuel climate change, and strain both economies and ecosystems. But what if this crisis could be reframed as an opportunity?

Reducing food loss and waste isn’t just about efficiency; it’s one of the most accessible and inclusive ways to improve food security, reduce poverty, and meet climate goals. Without planting a single extra seed, South Asian countries can boost food availability, raise rural incomes, curb emissions, and create green jobs. It’s a win for people, the economy, and the planet.

Today, countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka are grappling with rising food demand, erratic weather patterns, and persistent malnutrition. Business as usual is no longer an option. Reducing food loss and waste can be the lever that connects food security, economic growth, and climate action.

Take Bangladesh, for instance. More than one-third of all food produced is lost in the country. This comes at an enormous cost, equivalent to over 4% of GDP. Food loss accounts for 13% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the productivity of a quarter of its arable land. The good news is that the Government has recognised the issue as a policy priority. But turning this intent into impact will demand hard trade-offs, rethinking subsidies, investing in logistics, and backing small-scale innovators.

Bhutan, too, faces its version of this challenge. As the country aims for high-income status by 2034, it loses nearly 32% of major staples like rice and maize. With a dual food economy, split between subsistence farming and market-oriented production, the need for tailored solutions is critical. The country’s food system must deliver not just food security, but also economic diversification, better nutrition, and jobs.

In Nepal, the figure is even more alarming: an estimated 43% of food is lost or wasted. Reducing that by just 30% could dramatically increase the supply of nutritious food to vulnerable populations. But change will require hard conversations around subsidies, food pricing, and distribution models.

Core structural issue

A core structural issue cuts across the region: food is simply priced too low to reflect its true value. Fertiliser and water subsidies, designed to boost production, often lead to overuse, inefficiency, and waste. Smarter support systems, such as direct cash transfers, can help reorient agriculture toward nutrition security and environmental sustainability.

The good news is that innovation is already happening in the region. India offers a compelling case of how policy, technology, and entrepreneurship can converge to curb food loss. With AI-driven supply chains, solar-powered cold storage, and digital platforms linking farmers to buyers, India is rethinking the architecture of its food system. Startups like Ecozen and DeHaat are not just improving logistics—they are creating jobs for rural youth, empowering women, and driving climate-smart growth.

Sri Lanka, too, is moving toward reform. Despite post-harvest losses of up to 40% in perishables, the Government is investing in digital logistics, regional trade corridors, and cold chain infrastructure. Local champions are also stepping up: CBL Foods works with over 23,400 farmers to reduce packaging waste through re-use and support food rescue programs while tea cooperatives are converting biomass into biochar to enrich soil health.

There are also signs of growing regional convergence. The South Asian Policy Leadership for Improved Nutrition and Growth (SAPLING) platform, convened by the World Bank with support from the Gates Foundation and other partners, is facilitating the exchange of ideas and policy alignment among governments and key stakeholders. Its upcoming “Beyond Waste” Policy Dialogue in Colombo (18–19 June) will provide a timely forum for South Asian leaders, researchers, and entrepreneurs to explore and identify solutions to the interconnected challenges of food systems, climate resilience, and economic development.

No longer a peripheral concern

What emerges from this moment is a clear signal: reducing food loss and waste is no longer a peripheral concern. It is central to achieving food security, advancing climate goals, and creating inclusive growth in the region. For South Asia, the question is not whether change is needed, but how quickly and decisively it can happen. Public and private actors alike have a role to play in strengthening infrastructure, reforming incentives, improving market access, and fostering innovation across the value chain.

Addressing food loss is not just about preventing waste. It is about restoring value to what we produce, ensuring dignity for farmers, better nutrition for families, and greater resilience in the face of overlapping crises.
