# When It Comes to Long-Term Value, Incumbents Should Think Like Digital Disruptors

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- Successful digital disruptors tend to focus on creating long-term value through two primary mechanisms: customer lifetime value (CLV) / customer acquisition cost and the end-to-end customer experience.
- Established companies are in a better position to leverage this "digital growth engine" primarily because they already have a customer base, unlike start-ups. 
- To galvanize their own digital growth, firms should align their customer experience ambitions with their financial goals, optimize their customer data strategy, and develop an "electronic brain" powered by predictive AI models.
- Other pivotal steps include differentiating engineering for experience, data, AI, and enterprise, launching a data and AI-enabled omnichannel customer outreach program, and transforming key performance indicators (KPIs), structure, and incentives.

Opinions:
- Measuring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBIDTA) profits may be the gold standard for assessing traditional companies, but this approach does not apply to digital businesses. 
- While digital disruptors do make profits, these profits are merely part of a larger, broader picture. 
- The perception that a company's success in the digital world can best be measured by its EBIDTA profits is considered a "great myth".

Measuring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBIDTA) profits may be the gold standard for assessing traditional companies, but it is not the way digital businesses think. Successful digital disruptors focus on creating long-term value through two distinct levers: customer lifetime value (CLV) / customer acquisition cost and the end-to-end customer experience. While digital disruptors have pioneered this approach, established companies are actually often better positioned to take advantage of this ‚Äúdigital growth engine‚Äù because they have one thing startups lack: customers. To kickstart their own digital growth engine, companies should: 1) Align their customer experience ambition with financial ambitions and operational reality, 2) Optimize their customer data strategy, 3) Differentiate engineering for experience, data and AI, and enterprise, 4) Develop an ‚Äúelectronic brain‚Äù powered by predictive AI models (with feedback loops).¬†5) Launch a data and AI-enabled omnichannel customer outreach program, and 6) Transform KPIs, structure, and incentives.

One of the great myths of the digital world is that you can best measure a company‚Äôs success by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBIDTA) profits. Although this may be the gold standard for assessing traditional companies, it is not the way digital businesses think. It‚Äôs not that digital disruptors don‚Äôt make money ‚Äî they do. But these profits are only part of the picture.
