    "Intelligence gathering in Sri Lanka is no doubt necessary but must be subject to the rule of law",
    "Trump has commenced the \u2018Clean USA\u2019 beginning with US security and intelligence enclave",
    "It is time that the Anura Kumara Dissanayake administration acts in line with the recent determinations and recommendations of the Supreme Court in the Easter Sunday attack fundamental rights case and bring the vital intelligence entity and the national security apparatus under a clearly defined Act of Parliament ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and democracy in Sri Lanka.",
    "The seven-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by retired Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya PC in SC FR 163/2019 expressed \u201cshock and dismay at the deplorable want of oversight and inaction\u2026pertaining to Security, Law and Order\u201d. The country\u2019s highest court underscored \u201cthe urgent need to place the National Security Council on a statutory footing\u2026\u201d and to \u201crevamp the security systems and intelligence structures\u201d.",
    "Government leaders here cleaning streets and drains, although welcome are matters best left to the local authorities! Meanwhile, ministers and parliamentarians might take a lesson from US President Donald Trump, though not the best of leaders to emulate. Trump soon after assuming for the second time, the world\u2019s most dangerously powerful seat, pledged to \u201c\u2026clean out all of the corrupt actors in our (US) national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them\u201d, he declared signing the \u2018Executive Orders\u2019 bringing them into force.",
    "The US President declared that he will \u201cdismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy\u201d. He said \u201c\u2026 faceless bureaucrats will never again be able to target and persecute conservatives, Christians or the left\u2019s political enemies, which they are doing now at a level that nobody can believe even possible\u201d. Trump said further, in order \u201cto expose the hoaxes and abuses of power that have been tearing our country apart, we will establish a truth and reconciliation commission to declassify and publish all documents on deep state spying, censorship and corruption.\u201d",
    "\u201c\u2026we will make every (state) Inspector General\u2019s office independent and physically separated from the departments they oversee, so that they do not become the protectors of the deep state,\u201d the president pledged! The US leader\u2019s reference to the \u201cdeep state\u201d is to the American security institutions including the intelligence, which analysts believe operate as a state within the state, outside the law and below the radar!",
    "They also believe that the US military-industrial complex, a dangerous union between the US defence establishments and the agents of the American arms industry, collaterally collaborating for wars in third world countries. At least three American Presidents Dwight Eisenhower in 1961, Donald Trump in 2020 and Joe Biden in 2025 publicly stated at the end of their respective terms as President, that they failed to break the American military-industrial complex!",
    "Intelligence gathering in Sri Lanka is no doubt necessary but must be subject to the rule of law. The so called \u2018deep state\u2019 must remain within the law and legitimised by an Act of Parliament, which the State is obliged to enact!",
    "(The writer is a former Member of Parliament.)"
