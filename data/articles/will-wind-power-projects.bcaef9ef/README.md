# Will wind power projects mortgage our future?

## Summary ðŸ¤–

Facts Presented:
- Saudi Arabia is focusing on renewable energy adoption and has a goal to reach 50% by 2030.
- It recently signed two agreements with Japan's Marubeni Corporation to purchase wind power at 1.566 US cents per kWh.
- Sri Lanka's power purchase agreement with Adam Green Energy Ltd. is priced at 8.26 US cents per kWh.
- The government of Sri Lanka asserts that this is the country's most significant foreign investment and provides continuous electricity for the next 20 years for a total price of $1 billion.
- Transparency International Sri Lanka filed 11 Right to Information applications about a cabinet-approved project related to wind power plants.
- Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda revealed that the global average price for wind power ranges from 3.5 US cents per kWh to 3.3 US cents per kWh, and that in India, the levelised tariff for wind power is 3.8 US cents per kWh.
- The investor, Adam Green Energy Ltd., supplies wind power to the Indian power grid at the competitive rate of 3.8 US cents per kWh.

Opinions Expressed:
- The author believes that if Sri Lanka had invited competitive tenders, a more competitive rate could have been possible.
- The author argues that the lack of responses to Right to Information requests indicates a violation of the people's sovereignty.
- The author asserts that the Sri Lankan government needs to answer public concerns about the pricing of wind power.
- The author suggests that India's involvement in Sri Lanka's power sector might be motivated by geopolitical considerations to counter Chinese influence.
- The author concludes that the people of Sri Lanka deserve answers to their questions about these energy projects and their rights need to be protected.


## Follow-up Questions ðŸ¤–

1. How feasible is Saudi Arabia's goal of increasing their share of renewables to around 50% by 2030 given its current energy resources and infrastructure?
2. Why is there such a large price discrepancy for wind power between Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka? 
3. How will this massive foreign investment impact Sri Lanka's domestic power sector and overall economy in the long run?
4. What is the rationale behind Sri Lanka's higher prices for wind energy as compared to the global weighted average? 
5. If the Sri Lankan government had invited competitive tenders, would the rate have been more align with global norms?
6. What are the specific concerns of Transparency International Sri Lanka regarding the ecological feasibility of these wind power projects?
7. Why have the authorities in Sri Lanka maintained silence on the requests for information regarding these projects?
8. Should the capital investment by the foreign developer have been treated as a loan? If so, what would have been a reasonable interest rate?
9. What impact will these projects have on the local ecology, especially given the fact that one of the proposed sites is a Ramsar declared wetland sanctuary?

Saudi Arabia aims to utilise her vast arid lands to harvest renewable energy resources and to increase her share of renewables to around 50% by the year 2030. This is similar to Sri Lankaâ€™s stated goal of 70% renewable energy usage by 2030. However, sadly this is where the similarity ends.

Recently, the Saudi Power Procurement Company entered into two agreements with Marubeni Corporation of Japan to purchase wind power at a staggeringly low rate of 1.566 US cents per kWh. Now compare this with Sri Lanka and the power purchase agreement with a foreign investor Adam Green Energy Ltd. at 8.26 US cents per kWh. True, the Government states that this will be the single most significant foreign investment in the country with a price of $ 1 billion and Sri Lanka will have uninterrupted electricity for the next 20 years, etc., and makes the convoluted argument that it is cheaper than thermal power which is 26.99 US cents per kWh and that the Ceylon Electricity Board purchases wind power from 9.67 to 13.99 US cents per kWh. Additionally, the power bought from Odamwadi solar project is higher in that it is 8.75 US cents per kWh unit.

Be that as it may be, if competitive tenders were invited even in Sri Lanka a more competitive rate could have been possible keeping with the global norms. But this was an unsolicited bid negotiated by the Government high ups. Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda has pointed out that for newly commissioned onshore wind projects, the global weighted average internationally for wind power is between 3.5 US cents per kWh to 3.3 US cents per kWh (2022 figures) and falling. In fact, in India the levelised tariff for wind power is 3.8 US cents per kWh. The very same investor is supplying wind power to the Indian power grid at this competitive rate.

This shrouded price has spurred Transparency International Sri Lanka to file no less than 11 Right to Information applications about this now cabinet-approved project that will come into fruition two years down the line and has questions regarding the legality, transparency, evaluation process, pricing, Government involvement, and the environmental impact assessment related to 250 MW wind power plant in Mannar and the 234 MW wind power plant in Pooneryn. Additionally, it strongly raises an alarm about the ecological feasibility of these projects which are located in an ecologically sensitive zone and one in a Ramsar declared wetland sanctuary.

The Right to Information has elicited a stony silence by the authorities and it is petitioned that the sovereignty of the people has been violated. If we take the pricing factor in isolation, it behooves the Government to answer this call at least, keeping aside the energy policy and investor friendliness that the Government talks about for this sector. Next question is do we need to buy wind energy in US$ for next 20 years? What justification is there to pay in US$ for our free wind. Capital investment by the developer could have been treated as a loan repayable at a reasonable interest rate.

Geopolitical considerations may have influenced India to be involved in our power sector in order to ward off Chinese intrusions, but there are questions both big and small that require answers for it appears that the peopleâ€™s sovereignty is being trampled and they have a right to know.
