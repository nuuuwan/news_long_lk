For the last few decades, the manufacturing sector has eagerly anticipated the arrival of fully automated factories. In these factories, production would be seamlessly orchestrated by a network of high-tech robots, intelligent machines, and sensors, tackling widespread labor shortages while significantly reducing operating costs. With minimal human intervention, they could theoretically operate in complete darkness, earning the moniker “lights-out factory.”

To date, the few prominent efforts to create such factories, such as Adidas’ U.S.- and Germany-based Speed Factories, Stanley Black & Decker’s Texas-based Craftsman tool factory, and Tesla, where CEO Elon Musk said, “excessive automation…was a mistake,” have cast doubt on its widespread viability. As a result, some industry experts are recommending abandoning the lights-out factory playbook entirely.

We argue that doing this would be a mistake. And the near-stagnant growth in manufacturing output per hour worked in mature economies like the U.S. (-0.4%) and Germany (1%) since 2018 underlines the need for automation to realize productivity gains.

The good news for manufacturers is that, based on our research and on-the-ground experience, we believe a significant shift is underway. The entry barriers for implementation that hindered earlier efforts are going to rapidly fall in the next few years. Robots are becoming more capable, flexible, and cost-effective, with embodied agents bringing the power of generative AI into the factory environment. Manufacturers must prepare for the inevitable disruption — or risk falling behind.

Transforming an Existing Factory to Lights-Out

Globally, pockets of innovation have emerged that prove the long-term viability of lights-out factories. Consider our client, a Europe-based automotive supplier, which made a bold decision to transform its existing brownfield setup into a fully automated operation where humans serve as planners, supervisors, and maintainers.

The company aimed to achieve cost-competitiveness, making it economically viable to operate in a high-cost country while continuing to serve customers within two days. It was able to reduce direct labor by 100%, effectively addressing the talent shortage issues plaguing its industry, and the factory experienced an 8% improvement in EBITDA. The initiative is now being scaled across multiple high-cost sites globally.

To initiate this transformation, our client proactively addressed the most common financial and technical challenges faced by lights-out manufacturers — which are found in all categories of factory operations:

Predictable processes.

Most factory processes involve repetitive tasks, making it technically feasible and profitable for robots to perform. For example, self-guided vehicles can easily navigate the shop floor along predetermined paths. However, a highly skilled workforce is needed to install and maintain these robots, limiting the potential for overall workforce cost reduction.

Unpredictable processes.

Even in tightly controlled environments, some factory processes remain inherently unstructured. Pre-programmed robots often fail to adapt to these complex unexpected situations. Automated quality control, for example, is sometimes unable to identify defects that may have occurred for the first time. This lack of adaptability in unforeseen circumstances prevents manufacturers from fully trusting automation.

Non-automatable processes.

Due to current limitations in the technology, certain intricate processes just cannot be automated. For instance, robots struggle with “kitting,” the process of picking and organizing various small parts together for assembling. These small parts are either too similar for robots to identify easily or too different for robots to grasp each correctly. As a result, human workers are still required to complete these tasks.

To tackle these inherent challenges, our client chose to adopt a “redesign for automation” approach for its process, products, and layout. This complete overhaul of factory operations added new process steps to improve automation feasibility while removing human-oriented process inefficiencies. For example, our client no longer had to sacrifice valuable floor space for storing inventory that humans can see and reach. Instead, they built second-story vertical storage areas that robots can easily access and navigate. With the freed-up space, they installed more machines to increase output by more than 30%. By essentially rebuilding processes from ground up, they uncovered innovative adaptations, which include:

Optimizing robot use to minimize costs.

The focus during the transformation was to streamline the number of robots deployed. For example, our client faced a key decision at the outset: Whether to invest half a million dollars just to transport plastic molded parts to the assembly station. The expense was high because a specialized robot was necessary for each part size. To avoid this expense, we helped them redesigned the process by adding a conveyor belt that grouped the outputs of similarly sized plastic parts together. This one new step reduced the number of required robots by half, significantly improving the lights-out factory’s business case.

Learning to anticipate future scenarios.

Our objective was to train the AI systems to prepare for uncertainty before production starts, rather than during it. For example, our client installed an automated visual inspector to take images and detect quality issues like scratches. Some defects occur so rarely that it can take years for the system to learn how to detect them without human support. To address this, we generated a large volume of artificial or “synthetic” images of potential defects, simulating various lighting conditions to match what the camera might capture. This additional step allowed us to deploy a fully trained visual inspector from day zero, eliminating the need for supervision till the system stabilizes.

Adjusting the process to avoid the task.

Process flows can be modified to bypass tasks that cannot yet be automated. For our client, no single robot could effectively perform kitting. To phase out this task, we established a QR-labelled box warehousing system in collaboration with suppliers. Each box contained a single part type, enabling robots to autonomously identify QR codes and retrieve boxes in the exact sequence required for assembly.

While our client’s lights-out factory showcases the tremendous potential of this approach, to-date, this transition has not been easy for all manufacturers. Many perceive the technical barriers as too prohibitive to take such a leap. They are often hesitant to make the necessary investments, fearing disruption to their entire factory operations, despite the promise of significant long-term gains. Furthermore, incremental technology advancements have not encouraged a holistic view of automation’s potential. However, this mindset is poised to change drastically, democratizing the concept of lights-out factories and making it more accessible to a broader range of manufacturers.

AI Is Lowering the Entry Barriers for Lights-Out Factories

We are now entering a transition that is bringing down the entry barriers for manufacturers of all sizes. Lights-out automation is dependent on robots that can perceive, plan, and perform tasks at nearly the same level as humans. Until a few years back, these robots only supported pre-planned, single-dimensional interactions with the factory environment, severely restricting their capabilities.

This is changing as embodied agents are bringing the power of Generative AI into the physical world of robotics. Now, robots can perceive changes to the shop floor from multimodal senses including text, audio, sensors, and signals. Accordingly, AI can generate simple plans and iterate on them to suit this understanding of the world. In real-time, robots can translate this plan into specific actions and execute it; such developments are very new, yet many have already entered the R&D pipeline of manufacturers and are beginning to be applied.

Instruction simplicity.

Programming and integration is 50 to 70% of the cost of a robotic application. Generative AI interfaces are expected to significantly drive this cost down by providing natural language interface for even non-technical workers to instruct robots. The transformation would be drastic: Instead of one specialized worker for every eight robots, the factory would only require one non-specialized worker for every 25 robots. Industry applications have already emerged. For example, Sereact has already rolled out a voice or text command interface, PickGPT, to interact with robots using simple instructions such as “I need to pack the order.”

The traditional approach of training robots for single tasks is becoming obsolete. DeepMind and 30+ research labs demonstrated that generalist robotic AI outperforms specialist robots by more than 50% across diverse tasks, such as cable routing, object manipulation, and pick-and-place. This versatility reduces the need for deploying numerous robots, minimizes downtime, and enhances overall effectiveness.

Currently, auto manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, and Tesla are all exploring task versatility through general purpose humanoids. For example, Open AI backed-Figure AI is being piloted at BMW across its body shop, sheet metal, and warehouse. However, the humanoid appearance becomes costly and unnecessary in lights-out environments without any human-robot interaction. Therefore, the technology is shifting toward more economical designs while maintaining the same versatility. For example, Mimic is building humanoid hands without legs.

Situation adaptability.

Robots can dynamically identify and adapt to changing industrial environments. For example, Covariant’s robotic foundation model devises its own strategies to deal with challenging pick-and-place tasks, such as shaking boxes to more easily grasp items inside it, enabling robots to handle more than 100,000 previously unseen SKUs at a customer warehouse on day one. Covariant’s models can adapt well because it has learned from millions of real-world multimodal datasets of robots picking objects. Pre-trained models will level the field for manufacturers by cutting setup time, boosting efficiency with on-the-fly adaptation and overall building trust in lights-out setups.

Human-like dexterity.

The frontier of automatable tasks is rapidly expanding as robots are getting better at imitating human behavior for a range of tasks. Toyota Research Institute is developing a “kindergarten for robots” where human tele-operators manually control robots to perform over 200 common human skills, such as using tools and pouring liquids, while a generative AI model learns these behaviors in the background. Google demonstrated that robots can even learn skills from videos by mapping out human movement trajectories on it. Just in the last year, automation solutions for the long-standing challenge of kitting are finally becoming industrialized. Daimler Truck has now partnered with Sereact to deploy an AI-powered solution capable of dynamically identifying and adjusting the gripping strategy based on the object.

Getting Started on Your Lights-Out Transformation

Manufacturers should first focus on understanding and addressing their current pain points; doing so can generate quick wins that help finance the journey ahead. In addition, manufacturers should perform a critical review of the entire transformation.

Rethink investment criteria.

While the payback period of individual automation use cases is crucial, considering it alongside the broader advantages of lights-out automation provides a clearer picture of an investment’s true value proposition. For example, in its cost-benefit analysis, our client’s finance team included the fact that overall output increases by 30% if lights-out is achieved.

Rethink implementation strategy.

Implementing a lights-out factory requires coordination across operations, product design, engineering, and purchasing. These multidisciplinary teams must collaborate closely to establish rapid improvement cycles for newly deployed robots and iteratively refine their solutions.

Rethink decision making.

Robots generate a continuous stream of digital data that can be captured and analyzed to offer unprecedented transparency to factory operations. This empowers smarter decision making that replaces intuition and potentially unreliable human inputs with a comprehensive root-cause analysis of all factors impacting the shop floor

In the foreseeable future, technology will cease to be a bottleneck for lights-out transformations. The decision to pursue this goal will primarily depend on the factory’s economic considerations, not the technical hurdles. Manufacturers that embrace automation and demonstrate agility in overhauling their operational strategies will be best positioned to capitalize on this wave.
