Usually, it comes in response to some statement about how the US and Europe are addressing the issue (or how they need to be). Sometimes I think people ask this in bad faith. It\u2019s a rhetorical way to throw up your hands, imply that the US and Europe aren\u2019t the real problem, and essentially say: \u201cif they aren\u2019t taking responsibility, why should we?\u201d However, amid the playground-esque finger-pointing there are some undeniable facts: China emits more greenhouse gases than any other country, by far. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most populous countries and a climate-tech powerhouse, and its economy is still developing.",
    "With many complicated factors at play, how should we think about the country\u2019s role in addressing climate change? China\u2019s emissions are the highest in the world, topping 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.",
    "There\u2019s context missing if we just look at that one number, as I wrote in my latest story that digs into recent global climate data. Since carbon dioxide hangs around in the atmosphere for centuries, we should arguably consider not just a country\u2019s current emissions, but everything it\u2019s produced over time. If we do that, the US still takes the crown for the world\u2019s biggest climate polluter. However, China is now in second place, according to a new analysis from Carbon Brief released this week. In 2023, the country exceeded the EU\u2019s 27 member states in historical emissions for the first time. This reflects a wider trend that we\u2019re seeing around the world: Developing nations are starting to account for a larger fraction of emissions than they used to. In 1992, when countries agreed to the UN climate convention, industrialized countries (a category called Annex I) made up about one-fifth of the world\u2019s population but were responsible for a whopping 61% of historical emissions. By the end of 2024, though, those countries\u2019 share of global historical emissions will fall to 52%, and it is expected to keep ticking down. China, like all nations, will need to slash its emissions for the world to meet global climate goals. One crucial point here is that while its emissions are still huge, there are signs that the nation is making some progress.\u00a0  China\u2019s carbon dioxide\u2019s emissions are set to fall in 2024 because of record growth in low-carbon energy sources. That decline is projected to continue under the country\u2019s current policy settings, according to an October report from the IEA. China\u2019s oil demand could soon peak and start to fall, largely because it\u2019s seeing such a huge uptake of electric vehicles.\u00a0 One growing question: With all this progress and a quickly growing economy, should we be expecting China to do more than just make progress on its own emissions?\u00a0 As I wrote in the newsletter last week, the current talks at COP29 (the UN climate conference) are focused on setting a new, more aggressive global climate finance goal to help developing nations address climate change. China isn\u2019t part of the group of countries that are required to pay into this pot of money, but some are calling for that to change given that it is the world\u2019s biggest polluter.\u00a0 One interesting point here\u2014China already contributes billions of dollars in climate financing each year to developing countries, according to research published earlier this month by the World Resources Institute. The country\u2019s leadership has said it will only make voluntary contributions, and that developed nations should still be the ones responsible for mandatory payments under the new finance goals.",
    "Talks at COP29 aren\u2019t going very well. The COP29 president called for faster action, but progress toward a finance deal has stalled amid infighting over how much money should be on the table and who should pay up. China\u2019s complex role in emissions and climate action is far from the only holdup at the talks. Leaders from major nations including Germany and France canceled plans to attend, and the looming threat that the US could pull out of the Paris climate agreement is coloring the negotiations.\u00a0 But disagreement over how to think about China\u2019s role in all this is a good example of how difficult it is to assign responsibility when it comes to climate change, and how much is at play in global climate negotiations. One thing I do know for sure is that pointing fingers doesn\u2019t cut emissions.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading Dig into the data with me in my latest story, which includes three visualizations to help capture the complexity of global emissions.\u00a0 Read more about why global climate finance is at the center of this year\u2019s UN climate talks in last week\u2019s edition of the newsletter.\u00a0 Keeping up with climate\u00a0\u00a0 Fusion energy has been a dream for decades, and a handful of startups say we\u2019re closer than ever to making it a reality. This deep dive looks at a few of the companies looking to be the first to deploy fusion power. (New York Times)\u2192 I recently visited one of the startups, Commonwealth Fusion Systems. (MIT Technology Review) President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy. Wright is head of the fracking company Liberty Energy. (Washington Post) In the wake of Trump\u2019s election, it might be time for climate tech to get a rebrand. Companies and investors might increasingly avoid using the term, opting instead for phrases like \u201cenergy independence\u201d or \u201cfrontier tech,\u201d to name a few. (Heatmap)",
    "Rooftop solar has saved customers in California about $2.3 billion on utility bills this year, according to a new analysis. This result is counter to a report from a state agency, which found that rooftop panels impose over $8 billion in extra costs on consumers of the state\u2019s three major utilities. (Canary Media) Low-carbon energy needs much less material than it used to. Rising efficiency in making technology like solar panels bodes well for hopes of cutting mining needs.

    "New York governor Kathy Hochul has revived a plan to implement congestion pricing, which would charge drivers to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan. It would be the first such program in the US. (The City) Enhanced geothermal technology could be close to breaking through into commercial success. Companies that aim to harness Earth\u2019s heat for power are making progress toward deploying facilities.
