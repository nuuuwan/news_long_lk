    "Kids have always played with and talked to stuffed animals. But now their toys can talk back, thanks to a wave of companies that are fitting children\u2019s playthings with chatbots and voice assistants.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trend that has particularly taken off in China: A recent report by the Shenzhen Toy Industry Association and JD.com predicts that the sector will surpass \u00a5100 billion ($14 billion) by 2030, growing faster than almost any other branch of consumer AI. According to the Chinese corporation registration database Qichamao, there are over 1,500 AI toy companies operating in China as of October 2025.  One of the latest entrants to the market is a toy called BubblePal, a device the size of a Ping-Pong ball that clips onto a child\u2019s favorite stuffed animal and makes it \u201ctalk.\u201d The gadget comes with a smartphone app that lets parents switch between 39 characters, from Disney\u2019s Elsa to the Chinese cartoon classic Nezha. It costs $149, and 200,000 units have been sold since it launched last summer. It\u2019s made by the Chinese company Haivivi and runs on DeepSeek\u2019s large language models.\u00a0 Other companies are approaching the market differently. FoloToy, another Chinese startup, allows parents to customize a bear, bunny, or cactus toy by training it to speak with their own voice and speech pattern. FoloToy reported selling more than 20,000 of its AI-equipped plush toys in the first quarter of 2025, nearly equaling its total sales for 2024, and it projects sales of 300,000 units this year.",

    "But Chinese AI toy companies have their sights set beyond the nation\u2019s borders. BubblePal was launched in the US in December 2024 and is now also available in Canada and the UK. And FoloToy is now sold in more than 10 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Thailand. Rui Ma, a China tech analyst at AlphaWatch.AI, says that AI devices for children make particular sense in China, where there is already a well-established market for kid-focused educational electronics\u2014a market that does not exist to the same extent globally. FoloToy\u2019s CEO, Kong Miaomiao, told the Chinese outlet Baijing Chuhai that outside China, his firm is still just \u201creaching early adopters who are curious about AI.\u201d China\u2019s AI toy boom builds on decades of consumer electronics designed specifically for children. As early as the 1990s, companies such as BBK popularized devices like electronic dictionaries and \u201cstudy machines,\u201d marketed to parents as educational aids. These toy-electronics hybrids read aloud, tell interactive stories, and simulate the role of a playmate.",
    "The competition is heating up, however\u2014US companies have also started to develop and sell AI toys. The musician Grimes helped to create Grok, a plush toy that chats with kids and adapts to their personality. Toy giant Mattel is working with OpenAI to bring conversational AI to brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, with the first products expected to be announced later this year. However, reviews from parents who\u2019ve bought AI toys in China are mixed. Although many appreciate the fact they are screen-free and come with strict parental controls, some parents say their AI capabilities can be glitchy, leading children to tire of them easily.\u00a0 Penny Huang, based in Beijing, bought a BubblePal for her five-year-old daughter, who is cared for mostly by grandparents. Huang hoped that the toy could make her less lonely and reduce her constant requests to play with adults\u2019 smartphones. But the novelty wore off quickly. \u201cThe responses are too long and wordy. My daughter quickly loses patience,\u201d says Huang, \u201cIt [the role-play] doesn\u2019t feel immersive\u2014just a voice that sometimes sounds out of place.\u201d\u00a0 Another parent who uses BubblePal, Hongyi Li, found the voice recognition lagging: \u201cChildren\u2019s speech is fragmented and unclear. The toy frequently interrupts my kid or misunderstands what she says. It also still requires pressing a button to interact, which can be hard for toddlers.\u201d\u00a0 Huang recently listed her BubblePal for sale on Xianyu, a secondhand marketplace. \u201cThis is just like one of the many toys that my daughter plays for five minutes then gets tired of,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wants to play with my phone more than anything else.\u201d  hide"
