    "Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October of last year. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, as the muscles in his head and neck progressively weakened along with those in the rest of his body. By 2024, doctors were worried that he might not be able to breathe on his own for much longer. So Rodriguez opted to have a small tube inserted into his windpipe to help him breathe. The tracheostomy would extend his life, but it also brought an end to his ability to speak.

    "\u201cA tracheostomy is a scary endeavor for people living with ALS, because it signifies crossing a new stage in life, a stage that is close to the end,\u201d Rodriguez tells me using a communication device. \u201cBefore the procedure I still had some independence, and I could still speak somewhat, but now I am permanently connected to a machine that breathes for me.\u201d Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez\u2019s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone\u2014a way for Jules to communicate in his \u201cold voice.\u201d",
    "\u201cHearing my voice again, after I hadn\u2019t heard it for some time, lifted my spirits,\u201d says Rodriguez, who today communicates by typing sentences using a device that tracks his eye movements, which can then be \u201cspoken\u201d in the cloned voice. The clone has enhanced his ability to interact and connect with other people, he says. He has even used it to perform comedy sets on stage. Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have used the voice cloning tool since ElevenLabs, the company that developed it, made it available to them for free. Like many new technologies, the AI voice clones aren\u2019t perfect, and some people find them impractical in day-to-day life. But the voices represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases, says Richard Cave, a speech and language therapist at the Motor Neuron Disease Association in the UK. \u201cThis is genuinely AI for good,\u201d he says.",
    "Cloning a voice Motor neuron diseases are a group of disorders in which the neurons that control muscles and movement are progressively destroyed. They can be difficult to diagnose, but typically, people with these disorders start to lose the ability to move various muscles. Eventually, they can struggle to breathe, too. There is no cure. Rodriguez started showing symptoms of ALS in the summer of 2019. \u201cHe started losing some strength in his left shoulder,\u201d says Fernandez, who sat next to him during our video call. \u201cWe thought it was just an old sports injury.\u201d His arm started to get thinner, too. In November, his right thumb \u201cstopped working\u201d while he was playing video games. It wasn\u2019t until February 2020, when Rodriguez saw a hand specialist, that he was told he might have ALS. He was 35 years old. \u201cIt was really, really, shocking to hear from somebody \u2026 you see about your hand,\u201d says Fernandez. \u201cThat was a really big blow.\u201d Like others with ALS, Rodriguez was advised to \u201cbank\u201d his voice\u2014to tape recordings of himself saying hundreds of phrases. These recordings can be used to create a \u201cbanked voice\u201d to use in communication devices. The result was jerky and robotic.

    "It\u2019s a common experience, says Cave, who has helped 50 people with motor neuron diseases bank their voices. \u201cWhen I first started at the MND Association [around seven years ago], people had to read out 1,500 phrases,\u201d he says. It was an arduous task that would take months.\u00a0  And there was no way to predict how lifelike the resulting voice would be\u2014often it ended up sounding quite artificial. \u201cIt might sound a bit like them, but it certainly couldn\u2019t be confused for them,\u201d he says. Since then, the technology has improved, and for the last year or two the people Cave has worked with have only needed to spend around half an hour recording their voices. But though the process was quicker, he says, the resulting synthetic voice was no more lifelike. Then came the voice clones. ElevenLabs has been developing AI-generated voices for use in films, televisions, and podcasts since it was founded three years ago, says Sophia Noel, who oversees partnerships between the company and nonprofits. The company\u2019s original goal was to improve dubbing, making voice-overs in a new language seem more natural and less obvious. But then the technical lead of Bridging Voice, an organization that works to help people with ALS communicate, told ElevenLabs that its voice clones were useful to that group, says Noel. Last August, ElevenLabs launched a program to make the technology freely available to people with speech difficulties. Suddenly, it became much faster and easier to create a voice clone, says Cave. Instead of having to record phrases, users can instead upload voice recordings from past WhatsApp voice messages or wedding videos, for example. \u201cYou need a minimum of a minute to make anything, but ideally you want around 30 minutes,\u201d says Noel. \u201cYou upload it into ElevenLabs. It takes about a week, and then it comes out with this voice.\u201d Rodriguez played me a statement using both his banked voice and his voice clone. The difference was stark: The banked voice was distinctly unnatural, but the voice clone sounded like a person. It wasn\u2019t entirely natural\u2014the words came a little fast, and the emotive quality was slightly lacking. But it was a huge improvement. The difference between the two is, as Fernandez puts it, \u201clike night and day.\u201d",
    "The ums and ers Cave started introducing the technology to people with MND a few months ago. Since then, 130 of them have started using it, \u201cand the feedback has been unremittingly good,\u201d he says. The voice clones sound far more lifelike than the results of voice banking. \u201cThey [include] pauses for breath, the ums, the ers, and sometimes there are stammers,\u201d says Cave, who himself has a subtle stammer. \u201cThat feels very real to me, because actually I would rather have a synthetic voice representing me that stammered, because that\u2019s just who I am.\u201d Joyce Esser is one of the 130 people Cave has introduced to voice cloning. Esser, who is 65 years old and lives in Southend-on-Sea in the UK, was diagnosed with bulbar MND in May last year. Bulbar MND is a form of the disease that first affects muscles in the face, throat, and mouth, which can make speaking and swallowing difficult. Esser can still talk, but slowly and with difficulty. She\u2019s a chatty person, but she says her speech has deteriorated \u201cquite quickly\u201d since January. We communicated via a combination of email, video call, speaking, a writing board, and text-to-speech tools. \u201cTo say this diagnosis has been devastating is an understatement,\u201d she tells me. \u201cLosing my voice has been a massive deal for me, because it\u2019s such a big part of who I am.\u201d  Joyce Esser and her husband Paul on holiday in the Maldives.COURTESY OF JOYCE ESSER   Esser has lots of friends all over the country, Paul Esser, her husband of 38 years, tells me. \u201cBut when they get together, they have a rule: Don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he says. Talking about her MND can leave Joyce sobbing uncontrollably. She had prepared a box of tissues for our conversation.  Voice banking wasn\u2019t an option for Esser. By the time her MND was diagnosed, she was already losing her ability to speak. Then Cave introduced her to the ElevenLabs offering. Esser had a four-and-a-half-minute-long recording of her voice from a recent local radio interview and sent it to Cave to create her voice clone. \u201cWhen he played me my AI voice, I just burst into tears,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019D GOT MY VOICE BACK!!!! Yippeeeee!\u201d \u201cWe were just beside ourselves,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d lost [her voice] forever.\u201d Hearing a \u201clost\u201d voice can be an incredibly emotional experience for everyone involved. \u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d says Fernandez, recalling the first time she heard Rodriguez\u2019s voice clone. \u201cAt the time, I felt sorrow, because [hearing the voice clone] reminds you of who he was and what we\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says. \u201cBut overwhelmingly, I was just so thrilled \u2026 it was so miraculous.\u201d Rodriguez says he uses the voice clone as much as he can. \u201cI feel people understand me better compared to my banked voice,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are wowed when they first hear it \u2026 as I speak to friends and family, I do get a sense of normalcy compared to when I just had my banked voice.\u201d",
    "Cave has heard similar sentiments from other people with motor neuron disease. \u201cSome [of the people with MND I\u2019ve been working with] have told me that once they started using ElevenLabs voices people started to talk to them more, and that people would pop by more and feel more comfortable talking to them,\u201d he says. That\u2019s important, he stresses. Social isolation is common for people with MND, especially for those with advanced cases, he says, and anything that can make social interactions easier stands to improve the well-being of people with these disorders: \u201cThis is something that [could] help make lives better in what is the hardest time for them.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I would speak or interact with others as much as I do without it,\u201d says Rodriguez.",
    "A \u201cvery slow game of Ping-Pong\u201d But the tool is not a perfect speech aid. In order to create text for the voice clone, words must be typed out. There are lots of devices that help people with MND to type using their fingers or eye or tongue movements, for example. The setup works fine for prepared sentences, and Rodriguez has used his voice clone to deliver a comedy routine\u2014something he had started to do before his ALS diagnosis. \u201cAs time passed and I began to lose my voice and my ability to walk, I thought that was it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I heard my voice for the first time, I knew this tool could be used to tell jokes again.\u201d Being on stage was \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cinvigorating,\u201d he adds.  Jules Rodriguez performs his comedy set on stage.DAN MONO FROM DART VISION   But typing isn\u2019t instant, and any conversations will include silent pauses. \u201cOur arguments are very slow paced,\u201d says Fernandez. Conversations are like \u201ca very slow game of Ping-Pong,\u201d she says.  Joyce Esser loves being able to re-create her old voice. But she finds the technology impractical. \u201cIt\u2019s good for pre-prepared statements, but not for conversation,\u201d she says. She has her voice clone loaded onto a phone app designed for people with little or no speech, which works with ElevenLabs. But it doesn\u2019t allow her to use \u201cswipe typing\u201d\u2014a form of typing she finds to be quicker and easier. And the app requires her to type sections of text and then upload them one at a time, she says, adding: \u201cI\u2019d just like a simple device with my voice installed onto it that I can swipe type into and have my words spoken instantly. For the time being, her \u201cfirst choice\u201d communication device is a simple writing board. \u201cIt\u2019s quick and the listener can engage by reading as I write, so it\u2019s as instant and inclusive as can be,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Esser also finds that when she uses the voice clone, the volume is too low for people to hear, and it speaks too quickly and isn\u2019t expressive enough. She says she\u2019d like to be able to use emojis to signal when she\u2019s excited or angry, for example.

    "Rodriguez would like that option too. The voice clone can sound a bit emotionally flat, and it can be difficult to convey various sentiments. \u201cThe issue I have is that when you write something long, the AI voice almost seems to get tired,\u201d he says.",
    "\u201cWe appear to have the authenticity of voice,\u201d says Cave. \u201cWhat we need now is the authenticity of delivery.\u201d Other groups are working on that part of the equation. The Scott-Morgan Foundation, a charity with the goal of making new technologies available to improve the well-being of people with disorders like MND, is working with technology companies to develop custom-made systems for 10 individuals, says executive director LaVonne Roberts. The charity is investigating pairing ElevenLabs\u2019 voice clones with an additional technology\u2014 hyperrealistic avatars for people with motor neuron disease. These \u201ctwins\u201d look and sound like a person and can \u201cspeak\u201d from a screen. Several companies are working on AI-generated avatars. The Scott-Morgan Foundation is working with D-ID. Creating the avatar isn\u2019t an easy process. To create hers, Erin Taylor, who was diagnosed with ALS when she was 23, had to speak 500 sentences into a camera and stand for five hours, says Roberts. \u201cWe were worried it was going to be impossible,\u201d she says. The result is impressive. \u201cHer mom told me, \u2018You\u2019re starting to capture [Erin\u2019s] smile,\u2019\u201d says Roberts. \u201cThat really hit me deeper and heavier than anything.\u201d",
    "Taylor showcased her avatar at a technology conference in January with a pre-typed speech. It\u2019s not clear how avatars like these might be useful on a day-to-day basis, says Cave: \u201cThe technology is so new that we\u2019re still trying to come up with use cases that work for people with MND. The question is \u2026 how do we want to be represented?\u201d Cave says he has seen people advocate for a system where hyperrealistic avatars of a person with MND are displayed on a screen in front of the person\u2019s real face. \u201cI would question that right from the start,\u201d he says. Both Rodriguez and Esser can see how avatars might help people with MND communicate. \u201cFacial expressions are a massive part of communication, so the idea of an avatar sounds like a good idea,\u201d says Esser. \u201cBut not one that covers the user\u2019s face \u2026 you still need to be able to look into their eyes and their souls.\u201d The Scott-Morgan Foundation will continue to work with technology companies to develop more communication tools for people who need them, says Roberts. And ElevenLabs plans to partner with other organizations that work with people with speech difficulties so that more of them can access the technology. \u201cOur goal is to give the power of voice to 1 million people,\u201d says Noel. In the meantime, people like Cave, Esser, and Rodriguez are keen to spread the word on voice clones to others in the MND community. \u201cIt really does change the game for us,\u201d says Fernandez. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away most of the things we are dealing with, but it really enhances the connection we can have together as a family.\u201d hide"
