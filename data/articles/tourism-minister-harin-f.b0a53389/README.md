The Supreme Court, in two landmark judgments today, determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegayaâ€™s (SJB) decision to expel Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party is legally valid.

As a result of this Supreme Court judgment, the expulsion of Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara will lead to the loss of their parliamentary seats and Ministerial portfolios.

The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Wengappuli and Arjuna Obeyesekere held that the decision made by the SJB to expel the two petitioners from the party is valid in law.

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando and Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkkara had filed two separate expulsion petitions challenging the SJB decision to remove them from their party membership.

Faiszer Musthpha PC appeared for Manusha Nanayakkara, Romesh de Silva PC appeared for Harin Fernandp while M.A. Sumanthiran PC with Viran Corea PC, Dr. Jayampathy Wickremaratne PC, Counsel Hejaaz Hizbullah and Sampath Wijewardane appeared for the SJB leader and General Secretary.
