The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) of Sri Lanka held a crucial Media Awareness Workshop at the National Child Protection Auditorium in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte recently. The workshop aimed to guide media professionals on how to adopt a sensitive and ethical approach when reporting on child protection and abuse cases. This initiative comes in the wake of growing concern regarding the media’s role in reporting such sensitive issues responsibly, while safeguarding the rights, privacy, and dignity of children involved.

The event was marked by the active participation of several influential figures, including Professor Madhubhashini Hewage from the Sri Lanka Defence University and Law Enforcement Expert Sri Narendra Rajapaksha, who served as key resource persons. National Child Protection Authority President, retired High Court Justice Preeti Inoka Ranasinghe, along with Director General Anoma Siriwardhana, Director Planning and Information Shanika Malalgoda, and Director Law Preetika Sakalasuriya, also attended the program, underscoring the importance of this initiative.

Several prominent media outlets were represented during the program, highlighting the breadth of engagement across different media platforms. These included: National Television, Shraddha TV, Independent Television Service, Daily Motherland, Daily FT Newspapers, Sri Lanka Radio Service and V. Journalists.

Sri Lanka Defence University Professor Madhubhashini Hewage evoked her thoughts, “In the digital age, the line between privacy and public interest can blur easily. Journalists must practise restraint and uphold ethical standards, especially when reporting on sensitive issues like child protection. The use of accurate and responsible language is vital to avoid further trauma to the victims and their families.”

Historical context and evolution of child protection efforts in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has been committed to advancing child protection over the past few decades, driven by both national policies and international commitments. Here’s an overview of the pivotal milestones that have shaped the country’s child protection landscape: Sri Lanka ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on 12 July 1991. This landmark move bound the country to a comprehensive framework for ensuring children’s rights, including protection from abuse, exploitation, and neglect. The implementation of Article 19 of the CRC, which specifically mandates protection from all forms of abuse and violence, was pivotal in laying the foundation for national child protection policies.

In 1998, the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) was established by the National Child Protection Authority Act No. 50. Its primary role is to address child abuse through policy formulation, awareness campaigns, and direct interventions. The NCPA’s work has been instrumental in shaping Sri Lanka’s approach to child protection, ensuring the establishment of both legal frameworks and community-based initiatives that directly address child welfare concerns.

The role of media in child protection

National Child Protection Authority President, Retired High Court Justice Preeti Inoka Ranasinghe said,  “The media plays an influential role in shaping public perception, and when covering cases of child abuse or protection, we must prioritise the dignity and privacy of the children involved. As journalists, it is your duty to ensure that the language and images used do not re-victimise children or compromise their safety.”

The media’s role in child protection is pivotal, especially in cases of child abuse. However, the sensationalised coverage of such sensitive cases has raised concerns about the impact of unethical journalism. The NCPA, recognising these risks, has developed media guidelines for journalists and broadcasters to ensure responsible reporting. These guidelines emphasise the need to:

Protect the identity of the child victims by refraining from disclosing personal details that could lead to identification.

Use non-sensational language that does not further traumatise the victim or sensationalise the abuse.

Highlight the support systems and services available for victims of child abuse, empowering the public to take action responsibly.

One prominent case discussed at the workshop was that of the 2018 child abuse case in Colombo, which drew extensive media attention. While the case shed light on a critical issue, the media’s failure to protect the victim’s identity caused widespread public outrage and further harmed the child involved. The NCPA used this case to highlight the importance of following ethical reporting standards to prevent re-victimisation.

In contrast, a 2017 child trafficking case demonstrated the positive potential of ethical journalism. The media’s careful handling of the case, including using pseudonyms and focusing on the societal implications of trafficking, led to greater public awareness and policy action.

National guidelines for ethical reporting on child abuse

A key takeaway from the workshop was the need for media professionals to align their reporting with national guidelines that have been developed by the NCPA over the years. The guidelines call for a child-sensitive approach to reporting, which includes using general descriptors or pseudonyms instead of real names, and ensuring that any visual or audio materials used do not compromise the child’s identity.

The NCPA’s 2019 report on child abuse revealed an alarming increase in reported cases, with sexual abuse accounting for 32% of incidents, followed by neglect at 28% and physical abuse at 23%. This trend underscores the growing urgency for responsible media coverage that can help prevent further harm and encourage reporting.

Media professionals play a crucial role in facilitating social change by not only reporting on incidents of abuse but also by using their platforms to educate the public about child protection. Ethical journalism can also serve as a tool for prevention, helping to reduce the stigma surrounding child abuse, ensuring that children feel safe when they come forward, and encouraging adults to be vigilant and proactive in reporting suspected abuse.

A striking example of this was Sri Lanka Radio Service, which has consistently aired awareness programmes on child protection, educating listeners about recognising signs of abuse and knowing how to report it. The NCPA’s partnerships with media outlets like Shraddha TV and Independent Television have facilitated nationwide dialogues about child rights and the resources available to victims.

The significance of the media awareness program

The March 2025 workshop marked a crucial moment in Sri Lanka’s ongoing efforts to integrate media professionals into the national child protection framework. It was also an opportunity to share the NCPA’s National Child Protection Policy and the Minimum Standards for Child Development Centres, which aim to ensure that children in institutional care receive the best protection possible.

The workshop was a testament to the collaborative approach Sri Lanka has adopted in addressing child abuse. It not only brought together key stakeholders, including legal professionals, academics, government representatives, and media experts, but also created a space for open dialogue and knowledge-sharing. This collective effort has the potential to create significant change in how media outlets handle sensitive child protection stories, ensuring that ethical standards become the norm rather than the exception.

Moving forward with ethical journalism in Sri Lanka

Law Enforcement Expert Sri Narendra Rajapaksha shared, “Ethical journalism in child protection is not just about reporting facts; it’s about handling those facts with care. We must be mindful of the impact our words and images have on the children involved, ensuring they do not become victims of exploitation in the name of news.”

Sri Lanka’s progress in child protection is a direct result of the combined efforts of the Government, civil society, and the media. The NCPA’s media training programs, including the one held on March 4, 2025, play a vital role in ensuring that journalists are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to report on child protection issues responsibly and ethically. By adhering to these guidelines, the media can continue to be a force for good in addressing child abuse and advocating for the rights of children across the country.

As Sri Lanka continues to tackle child abuse and exploitation, it is essential that media professionals remain vigilant in their ethical responsibilities, ensuring that the stories they report do not inadvertently cause harm to the very children they seek to protect. The future of child protection in Sri Lanka lies in the hands of both policy-makers and media professionals, working together to create a safer, more informed society for all children.
