    "The NPP\u2019s long and sometimes insidious struggle \u2013 as most potently expressed in the impetus it gave the Aragalaya \u2013 to critically engage the corrupt regime entrenched at the time has borne a triple-blossomed fruit. First, when AKD clinched the presidency in September 2024. Then, when the floodgates of the people\u2019s fury swept the rank and file of a crooked parliament into the streets in November the same year. And finally, in its convincing-enough win at the LG polls last week",
    "It would seem in the week or so past of horse-trading post local government elections that there has been a smidge of a slide in the government\u2019s standing. And an attendant debit to its social credit ratings and political capital. If this is rumour, a reputational setback or reality \u2013 the truth be told \u2013 only a day ahead would reveal.",
    "While the aura of a nation is still majorly a lighter shade of red to judge from the polls results, there is cause for some governors\u2019 countenances to go from being in the pink to puce if not purple.",
    "Not that the incumbent administration doesn\u2019t merit being in the pink... because until recently at least, it has toed the straight and narrow on social justice planks, and fuelled the ethically loaded fantasies \u2013 social justice, crime and punishment, etc. \u2013 of a now-forgotten citizenry.",
    "Who, though they\u2019re all but juggling cost-of-living curve balls, still desire more than three basic meals a day for themselves and their children... as if lighting hopeful Vesak lanterns in the rain is better than bitterly cursing the darkness?",
    "But as reported severally in the media, in a discernible shift amidst the gathering gloom of more than the May-onset southwest monsoon, the National People\u2019s Power\u2019s ostensible abandonment of its anticorruption rhetoric has tilted the playing field a tad.",
    "That field is now leaning at a tangent towards moral nullity in which the old, oft-lamented political culture of deals, double-crossing the electorate and stealing election victories by hook or by crook can come creeping in on little cat feet... and try to pussyfoot around with the new tyro government\u2019s highfalutin principles.",
    "The National People\u2019s Power\u2019s ostensible",
    "abandonment of its anticorruption rhetoric has tilted the playing field a tad",
    "And a smug opposition that would be better occupied turning the torchlight of scrutiny on its own twin houses \u2013 UNP and SJB, showing that political blood is thicker than the cleansing waters of AKD\u2019s Kalawewa bucketing \u2013 isn\u2019t pulling any punches in their fighting nose-bloodied corners.",
    "The latter in particular has levelled nasty allegations against the NPP political machine that is supposedly greasing the wheels of an engine gearing up against the underhand mechanism of coalition politics.",
    "And the literally and allegorically lost UNP was smiling all the way to leveraging itself into the CMC through the backdoor last week. Is there no limit or date of expiry to the Grand Old Party\u2019s cynical opportunism? And has the Compass lost its sense of true north?",
    "This would be funny in a tragicomic way of sorts if it wasn\u2019t fury-inducing.",
    "For one, moral mandates given must still matter in a nation that only this week embraced the peaceful, inclusive and pluralistic ethic of the thrice-blessed festival of lights that unites islanders from literally all walks of life at dansals around the country and pandals at waterlogged junctions.",
    "The NPP\u2019s long and sometimes insidious struggle \u2013 as most potently expressed in the impetus it gave the Aragalaya \u2013 to critically engage the corrupt regime entrenched at the time has borne a triple-blossomed fruit.",
    "First, when AKD clinched the presidency in September 2024. Then, when the floodgates of the people\u2019s fury swept the rank and file of a crooked parliament into the streets in November the same year. And finally, in its convincing-enough win at the LG polls last week.",
    "This must count for something in the larger scheme of things for a Sri Lanka that only so recently \u2013 tantalisingly \u2013 seemed poised on the cusp of a paradigm shift for nation, state, country, government, political culture and social ethos. We were about to dive off the precipice and start trusting politicians again!",
    "Even if the dregs of the traditional political parties appear resistant to the new brooms sweeping not so well, it is incumbent on their integrity to yield to the people\u2019s will. But it\u2019s arguably a bridge too far for some older political movements (GOP & Sons, Pohottuwa & Co.) that are so compromised by decades of dirty politics.",
    "This is arguably more so since the JVP-led NPP has demonstrated not only its good faith in conducting the LG polls freely, fairly, and sans let or hazard to the electorate and electoral apparatus of state, but also proven its bona fides in a democratic osmosis into mainstream politics.",
    "This was a welcome departure from its student movements\u2019 ethics in state-run universities where hammer and sickle still represent clenched fists against all comers rather than an open-handed approach to governance.",
    "Good eggs going rotten?",
    "Now the problem is that the good eggs are ostensibly on the verge of going the way of all flesh \u2013 towards the garbage bin rather than being served as a satisfying meal to feed a people who are hungry for more than provender. But rather, are yearning for a dish of peace with plenty of social justice to accompany it.",
    "By some accounts the supposedly sea-green incorruptible stalwarts at the helm of a welcome anticorruption movement were allegedly manoeuvring behind the scenes earlier this week in a bid to secure the local government councils \u2013 some 100 of these \u2013 that they were in danger of losing because they were hung.",
    "Of course, the sterling mandarins who once preached from the highest pulpits on the campaign trail have denied it and rushed to defend their probity while their compatriots are allegedly no better than those brothers-in-arms \u2013 the SJB and the UNP \u2013 who are doing the same thing.",
    "It is utterly reprehensible to any notional citizen who has \u2018had it up to here\u2019 with slick big city politicians who bulldoze their way over the national will in the name of realpolitik. Or on the assumption that the people will take the resigned adjustment to reality view that after all \u2018politics is the art of the possible\u2019.",
    "Under this premise, we\u2019ve seen one too many administrations tread the alliance path to perdition and take the nation down the high road to destruction by reneging on their much vaunted pre-election manifestoes or muddying their mid-term manners.",
    "Dharmishta Samaajaya did it. Capitalism with a Human Face did it. Zero Civilian Casualties did it. Good Governance did it. They all do it. So why not us eh!",
    "So it is with utter dismay that the polity registers and records that the NPP stands in the dock \u2013 rumouredly? reputationally? realistically? \u2013 with the worst of the detritus from a rotten, discarded, discredited set of yesterday\u2019s politicians, looking cynically for lacunae and loopholes in the electoral system, to cling so desperately to the very power that the people so determinedly didn\u2019t want to give them...",
    "Can, or will, the Compass point us right again?",
