The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) held a Global Outlook event in London, which included presentations on global economic trends and the potential economic impacts of the upcoming US elections.

Tom Rafferty, head of global forecasting and economics at EIU, said global growth has been resilient despite rising interest rates and geopolitical risks. The EIU is expecting 2.5% growth in 2024, a figure that remains unchanged from the previous year. He also noted inflation is settling at a level higher than the pre-pandemic average, attributed partly to supply chain reconfigurations, changing labour markets, and a lack of housing supply pushing up costs.

Senior global economist and lead commodities analyst Matt Sherwood predicted that Joe Biden will win re-election in November in a very close race. Sherwood said that the divided Congress will limit the ability of any president to pursue their policy agenda. He highlighted policy differences in areas such as US policy towards China and Ukraine.

The event concluded with a Q&A session covering topics such as UK defence spending, Chinaâ€™s EV infrastructure and challenges to the green transition.
