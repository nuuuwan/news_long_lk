Facts Presented:

- In his book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, sociologist Matthew Desmond highlighted the key role of housing (or lack thereof) in perpetuating poverty in the US.
- The Jan-Feb 2024 Household Pulse Survey showed a 48% increase in American homelessness since 2015, with 37% of tenants likely to face eviction in the next two months.
- In Vienna, 60% of residents live in subsidized housing, funded by a 1% salary tax and supported by the construction of 6,000-7,000 housing units annually.
- In 1979, Sri Lanka embarked on an ambitious housing project to build 100,000 units in three years, initiated by Ranasinghe Premadasa.
- The UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing labels homelessness as the 'social issue of the 21st Century'.
- Under Premadasa's leadership, Sri Lanka launched a housing program that exceeded its targets by 15%-30%, according to Prof KM de Silva.
- The 100,000 Houses programme, despite its success, proved expensive and excessively centralized, leading to a shift to a more participatory model in the next phase, the One Million Houses programme.

Opinions Expressed:

- Low wages in conjunction with high rents create an inescapable poverty trap for workers.
- Failing to address the issue of affordable housing contributes to the creation and exacerbation of poverty.
- Premadasa's housing initiative was vital for socio-political and familial stability and for offering the poor a stake in the system.
- Premadasa managed to make public sector recruitment mandatory on competitive exams, creating a fairer system.
- The 200 Garment Factories Programme, which aimed at spreading low-paid workers throughout different regions rather than confining them to specific zones, demonstrated that export-oriented and labour-friendly industrialization is possible.
- Premadasa's vision for Sri Lanka was a country where ethnic, religious and social differences wouldn't lead to violent conflicts. He believed that tangible improvements in living conditions for all citizens, regardless of their backgrounds, was crucial for lasting unity and stability.
- Premadasa's innovative approach to tackling social issues and economic inequality remains timeless and essential, even if the actual programs might not be directly replicable in contemporary times.
