The Sri Lankan government has declared a day of national mourning over the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, whose helicopter crashed during a trip from Azerbaijan. Raisi is known for his role in the 1988 death commission which executed thousands of political dissidents and is reviled both domestically and internationally. His rise to the presidency paved the way for conservative hardliners to take complete control over all Iranian institutions, leading to an increasingly brutal regime. Despite this, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has been accused of pandering to Iranian interests, has called for the mourning. Some believe this is part of a bid to attract votes from politically active and influential groups within the Sunni-majority Muslim community in Sri Lanka, who are influenced by the global power of Shia Islam as represented by Iran.
