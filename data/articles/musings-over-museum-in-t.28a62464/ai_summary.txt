The President of Sri Lanka has proposed a Rs. 25 million plan to construct a museum in Kalmunai honouring the late M.H.M. Ashraf, founder of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. The museum was proposed at the request of a Digamadulla District Member of Parliament. However, the late Minister's son suggested that this proposal may be an election tactic and that his father would have wanted resources to be allocated towards improving education, agriculture, fisheries and generating career opportunities for the youth of Digamadulla. The article also questions the necessity of the museum in Kalmunai, referring to neglected projects and infrastructure in the area. Instead, the author proposes the construction of a well-equipped public library, suggesting it may be more beneficial to the community.
