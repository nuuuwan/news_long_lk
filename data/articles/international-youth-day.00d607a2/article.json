    "Youth not only represent the future of our nations but are one of society\u2019s main agents of change and progress for any country. As stated by United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, \u201cAchieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a seismic shift \u2013 which can only happen if we empower young people and work with them as equals.\u201d",
    "In 1999, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the recommendation by the World Conference of Ministers of Youth (Lisbon, 8-12 August 1998) that 12 August be declared International Youth Day. Over the last two decades, the annual International Youth Day celebrations have covered a wide array of themes relevant to young people, from food security and mental health to intergenerational solidarity and green skills, highlighting critical connections between youth and sustainable development.",
    "Youth can be a positive force for development when provided with the knowledge and opportunities they need to thrive. Today, there are 1.2 billion young people aged 15 to 24 years, accounting for 16% of the global population. Half of the people on our planet are 30 or younger, and this is expected to reach 57% by the end of 2030.",
    "This year 2024 theme for the International Youth Day is \u201cFrom Clicks to Progress: Youth Digital Pathways for Sustainable Development\u201d which is a timely theme with the current context of the world where there is more focus on digitalisation.",
    "Youth as digital generations and visionaries since the adoption of SDGs in 2015, global internet connectivity has seen remarkable growth, with over two-thirds of the global population using the internet in 2023, and mobile phone subscriptions reaching 8.63 billion in 2022. Notably, internet access in the least developed countries increased from 7% of the population in 2015 to 36% in 2023, while connectivity in high-income and upper-middle-income countries reached 92% and 79%, respectively and through this digitalisation, young people have higher access to digital technologies compared to other demographic groups. Comparative analysis shows that worldwide, 75%, or three-quarters, of young people aged 15 to 24 used the internet in 2022.",
    "Objectives of 2024 International Youth Day \u201cFrom Clicks to Progress: Youth Digital Pathways for Sustainable Development\u201d, highlights the key connection between digitalisation and accelerating SDG progress, emphasising the pivotal role of young people in this transformative process. Specifically, it aims to explore the instrumental role of technologies and data accelerating efforts towards achieving SDGs including the role of young people in advance digital transition and to showcase diverse youth led focused digital solutions and innovations at the global and national levels that contribute to sustainable development. Also provide a knowledge base for stakeholders, such as youth, civil society and national governments as well as relevant UN agencies, to access data and insights on the topic.",
