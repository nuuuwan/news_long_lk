1️⃣ The Colombo Plan marked its 73rd anniversary with the launch of the Training of Trainers (ToT) on Dignified Menstruation (DM). 🎉
2️⃣ The event was celebrated with cooperation between The Colombo Plan and the Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM). 🤝
3️⃣ The ToT aims to dismantle menstrual discrimination and enhance this capacity in The Colombo Plan’s member countries. 🌐
4️⃣ 23 individuals from 13 countries participated in the ToT and the anniversary celebrations. 🎈
5️⃣ Secretary-General Dr. Benjamin P. Reyes emphasised the importance of this issue, given that such disrespect and violation of women’s rights is still prevalent. 👩‍⚖️
6️⃣ Reyes highlighted the problem of 'period poverty', which the United Nations defines as lack of access to period products and private, clean spaces. 🚻
7️⃣ The issue extends to inbuilt beliefs and stigma in certain cultures, where menstruating women are considered unclean. 🚫
8️⃣ This stigma can lead to women being excluded and confined to their homes, and can impact a girl's education, potentially leading to early marriage and pregnancies. 👩‍🎓
9️⃣ Through its experience and expertise, The Colombo Plan aims to serve as a platform for knowledge, improved interventions and the elimination of discrimination. 🎯
🔟 The organization commits to making the world a better place, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal No. 5 - empowering women. 🚺💪
