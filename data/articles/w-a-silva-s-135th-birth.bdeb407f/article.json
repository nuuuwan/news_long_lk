    "Ven. Watavana Sirisumana Thero (left) and Akuru Collective Co-Founder Pathum Egodawatte (right) extend a warm welcome to the guests at the W.A. Silva Memorial",
    "The 135th birth anniversary of W.A. Silva, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most celebrated Sinhala novelists, took place on 16 January at the W.A. Silva Museum in Colombo 6. The W.A. Silva Foundation, in collaboration with the Akuru Collective and led by Ven. Watavana Sirisumana Thero and Ravi Thilakawardana, organised the memorial, bringing together literary enthusiasts and media representatives to honour W.A. Silva\u2019s remarkable contributions to Sinhala language, and literature.",
    "Central to the celebration was a thought-provoking discussion on W.A. Silva\u2019s legacy, featuring senior journalist Sunil Sarath Perera and renowned writer Kathleen Jayawardena, with the moderation of Hela Havula President Srinath Ganewatta. The session explored Silva\u2019s engagement with the intellectual movements of his time, his creativity and resilience in overcoming criticism, and his profound impact on the progression of Sinhala literature.",
    "Commenting on this momentous occasion, W.A. Silva Foundation Chairman/Director Ven. Wathavana Sirisumana Thero stated, \u201cWhen we first acquired \u201cSilvermere\u201d, the residence of W.A. Silva, it was in a state of severe disrepair. We believed that safeguarding this home would be the greatest tribute to W.A. Silva. Today, we have successfully preserved and archived original manuscripts, first editions, and book covers, placing them all here. This is how the W.A. Silva Museum came to life, and we strongly believe that it has now become a home for fellow literary enthusiasts.\u201d",
    "W.A. Silva, renowned for works such as Vijayaba Kollaya, Kele Handa, and Siriyalatha, modernised the Sinhala novel, introducing global themes to local audiences in the early 20th century. His former residence, \u201cSilvermere\u201d, a national monument, now serves as the W.A. Silva Museum, dedicated to preserving Sri Lanka\u2019s literary and typographic heritage. The museum houses a library, an archive, a traditional printing press, and hosts community events, inspiring future generations of writers and readers.",
    "W.A. Silva Foundation Secretary Ravi Thilakawardana expressed his thoughts stating, \u201cOur goal has always been to transform the \u201cSilvermere\u201d residence into a hub for language and literature, a place that can inspire future generations. As part of this vision, we decided to hold this discussion here. I firmly believe that having a language and literary museum in the heart of Colombo is of great significance, and we are committed to further developing this space for the future.\u201d",
    "Renowned writers Sunil Sarath Perera and Kathleen Jayawardena shared their insights during the discussion, stating, \u201cW.A. Silva was more than just a social reformer; he was a writer who evoked beauty and wonder through his stories. I learned the values of humanity, generosity, and honesty from \u201cVijayaba Kollaya\u201d, particularly through the character Asanga, who chooses to awaken rather than kill his enemy, a lesson that deeply impacted me,\u201d stated Perera. Jayawardena also added, \u201cW.A. Silva can truly be called a literary monarch. There\u2019s a distinction between knowledge and the wonder that art and beauty provide. It\u2019s a lesson we all need to learn. It\u2019s a tragedy that the works of both W.A. Silva and G.B. Senanayake are often confined to bookshelves without reaching a wider audience.\u201d",
    "The festivities also included exhibitions showcasing rare artifacts such as handwritten manuscripts, original book covers, and personal items, offering visitors a glimpse into the life of W.A. Silva. The W. A. Silva Foundation, along with the \u201cAkuru Collective and Institute of Typography\u201d, has planned to launch a series of programs for literary enthusiasts throughout the year."
