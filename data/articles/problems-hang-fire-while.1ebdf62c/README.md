The new JVP/NPP government has been in power for less than two months. They are faced with mounting problems which are not of their making. In Opposition the president and his political party, which now rules our country condemned the former president Wickremesinghe for ignoring the plight of the masses.

Sadly since the new regime took over the plight of the poorest sections has worsened. The cost of living has increased even further. The prices of basic food items have increased rapidly since the new regime assumed office.

The clearest examples being the rise in the price of rice and coconuts. The price of food items essential to all sections of the community has shot up. Even the price of eggs which the government tried to rein in via a fiat has fallen flat on its face. Prices escalated despite the best efforts of the President and his Cabinet of three -including himself.

In desperation the government is suggesting taking over distribution of specific items via specified outlets to ensure stability of prices. It brings to mind the era of the ULF government in the seventies. It ended in an era of shortages, queues and the then government being thrown out of power. The government needs to come up with a long-term plan rather than ad hoc measures.

Another hurried strategy appears to be providing handouts to specific groups. Prey, where does the government hope to find cash for such a measure while we struggle to pay off our international debts?

Having made the dissolution of parliament one of his priorities, the President dissolved parliament. The President and his team -none of whom has had much experience of governing- find themselves spending more time canvassing for votes rather than attempting to intelligently solve important problems affecting the country.

According to CEIC Data, the Government Debt had increased to 93.4 US $ billion in Jun 2024, compared with 93.5 US $ billion in the previous quarter.

The government has still not informed the electorate how it would tackle this growing debt burden. Additionally a condition to receive the International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt restructuring facility was an agreement not to print money. The previous government got around this barrier by using multiple liquidity tools.

On 25 October ‘Economy Next’ gave details of the government driving excess money into the banking system through a term auction of printed money valued at 70 billion rupees. A short-term solution leads to greater indebtedness. According to ‘CEIC Data’, as mentioned earlier, our National Government Debt reached 93.4 US $ billion in June 2024.

As if the existing problems are insufficient, we are now pestered by the large-scale presence of Israeli tourists in the country. At the same time at the UNHRC our country faces charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and atrocities by our military forces.

Western countries quote R2P or right to protect -people in jeopardy by all other parties, states and peoples and institutions. SL State had to bear this accusation and inquiries persist at the UNHRC.

By a twist of fate our country has become a location for providing rest and recreation (R&R) facilities to Israeli troops, who in real time are committing genocide on the people of Palestine.

Our government has to be clear about its position re this type of tourism. Yes, treat all visitors equally and with respect. But we need to face up to moral issues as well. How do we deal with those who treat their own nationals ie Palestinians- as expendable?

Using this barometer it is also a good time to look inwards -at ourselves- and bring to justice those who violated the human rights of our Tamil brethren during the ethnic war. The Sri Lankan forces committed excesses, so did the LTTE and other militant groups and organisations.

Our government and the people must recognise this reality. We spoke of ‘zero casualties’. What is our commitment to Human Rights, individual and collective?

The cries of the victims in our country, cry to heaven for justice. All Lankan communities and the government need to face up to our involvement in these crimes -whether by choice or otherwise.

Our government needs to come up with solutions to all these problems. This is their mandate.
