The Sri Lanka Election Commission has announced that the Presidential elections will be held between September 17 and October 16, 2024. There are likely to be three main candidates: incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)/National People’s Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. A close contest is expected, with no single candidate projected to garner more than 50% of the Sinhala vote, which makes up 74.9% of the population. This would increase the significance of votes from smaller ethnic minority communities such as the Sri Lankan Tamils, Sri Lankan Muslims, and Tamil Indian origin population. Their combined population constitutes 25.5% of Sri Lanka’s total population. Minority community votes, most notably those from Tamil and Muslim communities, could potentially decide the outcome of the election, especially if they vote unanimously for one candidate.
