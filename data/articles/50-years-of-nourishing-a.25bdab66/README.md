Our mission remains the same: to feed the nation with quality, care, and integrity

If you asked most Sri Lankans to describe their ideal lunch menu to you, it is highly likely to include a spicy chicken curry, or some other equally popular preparation.

But especially among younger generations, few may realise that just fifty years ago, chicken was not considered a staple, but rather an infrequent luxury. It was a dish families saved for festive occasions, while most relied on fish and lentils for their daily protein.

At that time, poultry farming was still a small, fragmented industry. Few could have imagined that within a few short decades, chicken would become the most affordable and widely consumed sources of protein, after fish, in the country.

That change didn’t happen by chance. It was built, over five decades through vision, discipline, and a determination to make quality food accessible to every household. When we incorporated Bairaha Farms on 27 October 1975, our purpose was clear: to nourish a nation with quality, care, and integrity. Today, that purpose continues to guide us, even as the world, and our industry evolves around us.

An ambitious journey of firsts

In the early years, we focused on setting the foundation for a modern, self-reliant poultry value chain. By 1976/77, we had established our parent breeder farms and hatchery in Katana, and by 1980/81, we launched commercial broiler farms and a state-of-the-art chicken processing factory, at that time equipped with blast freezers and cool rooms, among the first of their kind in Sri Lanka.

A few years later, in 1985, we introduced contract broiler farming, which allowed rural farmers to become part of a structured supply chain. This model helped strengthen rural economies by offering steady income to growers initially in the Gampaha district and subsequently in Kurunegala and Puttalam districts among others. A number of original partners and their next generations continue to grow with us today.

As the industry evolved, so did we. Becoming a public listed company in 1994 marked a new phase of transparency and governance, while our joint venture with Hybro B.V. of the Netherlands in 2004 in setting up a broiler breeder grandparent farm and hatchery elevated breeder operations through global expertise. What began with around 50 employees has grown into a network of over 1,300 direct team members across 13 operational sites, supported by thousands of both broiler and corn growers, distributors, and suppliers, retailers and consumers.

Each milestone marked steady progress toward a stronger, more self-reliant poultry industry for Sri Lanka.

Feeding a nation, building an economy

In 1980, the average Sri Lankan consumed about 100 grams of chicken a year. Today, that number stands at 11.8 kilograms of chicken and 137 eggs per person annually. Chicken is no longer an occasional indulgence but an everyday household staple.

The poultry industry now contributes 1.1% to national GDP, accounting for 79% of the livestock economy. This growth has touched every level of society from smallholder farmers and feed producers to retailers and logistics providers. At Bairaha, we have witnessed how these partnerships have transformed rural livelihoods, creating stability and entrepreneurship in communities once dependent on seasonal agriculture.

Innovation and sustainability

Continuous improvement has always been our driving force. Over the years, we have invested in feed technology, breeding science, and processing facilities that meet international standards, including GMP-SLSI, HACCP, ISO 22000, and FSSC 22000.

Data from the Department of Animal Production and Health show that in 2024, chicken meat production grew by 10% to 258,540 metric tonnes, while day-old chick production rose by 13% to nearly 188 million – clear signs of a sector continuing to expand through consistent investment and resilience.

Equally vital is sustainability. We have introduced renewable energy solutions, waste-to-value systems, and strict biosecurity and animal-welfare standards to ensure that growth remains responsible. Our focus is on building a business that grows with discipline and conscience, creating lasting value for our customers, our partners, and the communities we serve.

These same principles now guide our vision for the next stage of growth.

Looking ahead: Policy, stability, and global competitiveness

Having made the difficult achievement of self-sufficiency in chicken and egg production, Sri Lanka’s next opportunity lies in export competitiveness. Our country’s Avian Influenza (bird flu) disease-free status and adherence to international food safety standards have ideally positioned our industry for growth. Already, Bairaha exports to the Maldives and we have received clearance to export to Singapore (subject to exporters and the Department of Animal Production and Health complying with certain other specific requirements), a milestone that reflects both quality and credibility.

However, the sector still faces challenges that require collective attention. Dependence on imported feed ingredients such as maize and soybean meal, together with high cost of locally produced corn and high levies on imported corn continue to affect cost structures and planning. Locally grown maize meets only about 50% of total demand, forcing imports at higher prices, due to special commodity levy and other taxes, which are factors limiting our ability to compete internationally.

We believe that sustained progress relies on consistent and collaborative policymaking. The poultry sector functions within an interconnected value chain, where even well-intentioned interventions can have unintended ripple effects.

Across the region, countries such as Thailand demonstrate how long-term policy consistency and close government–industry alignment can strengthen competitiveness. A similar approach in Sri Lanka would enable the sector to plan and invest more effectively, ensuring that growth contributes meaningfully to national food security.

Excellence always: Our people, our promise

At Bairaha, we are taking steps toward greater productivity and self-reliance. From mechanised corn cultivation with our joint venture partners using a harvesting machine and irrigation system, among others, to value-added poultry products designed for both domestic and export markets, we aim to continue leading the modernisation of Sri Lanka’s poultry industry. Our goal is to help build a more resilient, sustainable food system for Sri Lanka while contributing to regional competitiveness.

Every achievement in our history has been powered by people. Generations of employees, growers, and distributors have helped shape Bairaha into the trusted household name it is today. Their dedication and integrity are the true foundations of our success.

As we celebrate our 50th anniversary, we do so with gratitude to our people, our partners, and our customers who have stood with us through every phase of change. Our mission remains the same: to feed the nation with quality, care, and integrity.

As we look to the years ahead, we carry forward the same sense of purpose that began in 1975, to keep earning the trust of the families who have made us part of their lives.
