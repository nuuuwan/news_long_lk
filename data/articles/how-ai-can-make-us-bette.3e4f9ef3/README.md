# How AI Can Make Us Better Leaders

## Summary ü§ñ

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to improving leadership skills by making leaders more human. By approaching leadership with a mindset that combines a focus on human qualities and the power of AI, a so-called "AI-augmented leader" can emerge, combining the best of human leadership and machine learning. This approach requires investing equally in human potential and technological potential, focusing on qualities such as awareness, wisdom, and compassion. The goal is not just to develop tools that change our lives but to adapt appropriately to the changes these tools introduce.

Humans are good at inventing tools, but not as good at adapting to the change these tools can cause. While there has been much focus on the technical impacts and potential dark side of AI, the authors‚Äô research has shown that AI can enhance and empower leadership, actually helping make leaders more human. To do this, we need to invest just as much in the development of our human potential as we do in harnessing the power of AI. This means focusing on the core leadership qualities of awareness, wisdom, and compassion, as well as taking on a both/and mindset. The ‚ÄúAI-augmented leader‚Äù can leverage both the power of AI and develop their most human qualities, bringing the best of both human and machine to their leadership practice.

Humans have always been better at inventing tools that change the way we live and work than adapting to the big changes these tools cause. Consider for a moment how the internet has given us instant access to gigabytes of data and yet has made us more distracted. Or how social media has enabled us to be more connected than ever, and yet can also alienate or isolate us.
