The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to improving leadership skills by making leaders more human. By approaching leadership with a mindset that combines a focus on human qualities and the power of AI, a so-called "AI-augmented leader" can emerge, combining the best of human leadership and machine learning. This approach requires investing equally in human potential and technological potential, focusing on qualities such as awareness, wisdom, and compassion. The goal is not just to develop tools that change our lives but to adapt appropriately to the changes these tools introduce.
