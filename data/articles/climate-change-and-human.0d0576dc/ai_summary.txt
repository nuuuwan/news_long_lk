Climate change is affecting human health in numerous ways, producing physical, mental, and psychosocial impacts globally, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6). The report expresses strong confidence that climate change has adversely influenced peopleâ€™s physical and mental health, citing extreme heat events, increasing food-, water-, and vector-borne diseases, exposure to wildfire smoke, and mental health impacts from disasters. Furthermore, climate actions and investment in climate change adaptation, mitigation, loss and damage, or a fair transition can positively affect health and enhance the effectiveness and resilience of the health sector. Human mobility is another intersection between climate change and health, with climate-related migration and displacement producing adverse health impacts.
