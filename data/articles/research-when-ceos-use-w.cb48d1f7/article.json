    "Corporate executives often use war metaphors like \u201cdeclaring war on the competition\u201d to project strength and confidence in their strategies. Research reveals that these aggressive metaphors may provoke negative reactions from a critical audience: financial analysts. After analyzing nearly 1,000 acquisition announcements, the authors find that war-related language tends to trigger negative reactions from analysts, who see it as a sign of excessive risk. This backlash is particularly strong when analysts believe that avoiding direct competition is in the company\u2019s best interest. The study highlights how important it is for companies to choose their metaphors wisely, as they significantly influence how analysts and other audiences perceive corporate actions.",

And while it\u2019s a particularly colorful example, it\u2019s hardly exceptional. In acquisition announcements, CEOs regularly frame their strategies as battles to be won. In 2006, then-CEO of the McClatchy Company, Gary Pruitt, told investors and analysts, \u201cThe stakes have never been higher \u2026 and we dare not go into battle with anything less than the best.\u201d In a 2015 conference call with analysts, executives at Infinera Corporation were \u201carmed with an end-to-end offering.\u201d In a 2013 call, Veeco Instruments described the mobile market as a \u201cbattleground,\u201d and in 2009 First Solar described their acquisition move as an \u201coffensive\u201d aimed at overtaking competitors.",
