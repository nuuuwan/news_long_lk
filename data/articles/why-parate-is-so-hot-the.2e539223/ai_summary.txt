1. 📚 A discussion has re-ignited regarding the parate right, a remedy provided in the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990, allowing banks quicker debt recovery against defaulting borrowers. 
2. 🔨 Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe proposed two potential solutions: abolishing the parate law, and providing options for distressed customers to restructure their credit lines. 
3. 🚫 Critics argue abolishing the parate right only addresses the "effect" and not the "cause". The cause is defined as the reason for the default, focusing on its removal may aggregate more issues.
4. 🤷 The parate right applies only to loans over Rs. 5 million and isn't activated until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 installments. Banks negotiate with borrowers before exercising the parate right.
5. 🏛️ Prior to the introduction of parate rights, banks had a lengthy court process to recover defaulted loans. Delays led to liquidity issues and potential bank collapses. 
6. 💰 On the other hand, if the parate is abolished, there's a risk borrowers will stop repaying loans, threatening the survival of banks.
7. 📈 The parate was introduced as a swift recovery process due to delays in court procedures which has caused systemic issues in banking and finance stability.
8. 💳 Banks lend money to applicants based on their repayment capacity. If forecasts of repayment capacity are incorrect, it increases the bank's Non-Performing Loans portfolio, leading to liquidity issues.
9. ⚖️ There are notable shortcomings of the parate process. For example, lender can act as both plaintiff and judge, leading to a conflict of interest and deviation from the Common Law.
10. 🗂️ CBSL reported in 2001 that nearly 90% of approved parate resolutions aren't pushed to the ultimate sale of a borrower's property, implying abolishing the law wouldn't result in a drastic increase in Non-Performing Assets.
