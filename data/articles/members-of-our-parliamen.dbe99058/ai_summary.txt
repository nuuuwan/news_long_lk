The article criticises members of the Sri Lankan Parliament for their excessive demands and lack of empathy towards the economically struggling population. While poverty remains above 22% and will likely continue until 2026, parliamentarians are reportedly securing permits for establishment of new liquor shops and demanding extensions to their insurance coverage to include their families. Reports have indicated that the permits are being sold for significant sums. Such actions are considered akin to the infamous indifference of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution. They also threaten the trust and support of the electorate leading up to the forthcoming general and presidential elections. Meanwhile, despite some political leaders opposing the opening of more liquor shops, revenue from the excise duty on alcohol has increased by 32.2%.
