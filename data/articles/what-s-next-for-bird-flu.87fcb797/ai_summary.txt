The bird flu has infected cows in nine US states, millions of chickens, and another dairy worker as of last week. In response, health officials are preparing 4.8 million doses of H5N1 bird flu vaccine. Traditional flu vaccine production uses a cumbersome process that relies on fertilized chicken eggs and takes months. Alternatives exist, such as Flucelvax, a seasonal flu vaccine grown from a cell line, and FluBlok, a synthesized vaccine. Additionally, mRNA vaccines are being developed which do not require the growth of a virus. Moderna is reportedly close to agreeing a deal with the US government to trial its bird flu vaccine. Some evidence suggests that non-egg-based vaccines may be more effective than traditional vaccines.
