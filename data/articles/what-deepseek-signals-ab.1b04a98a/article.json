    "Rather than understanding DeepSeek\u2019s R1 as a watershed moment, leaders should think of it as a signal of where the AI landscape is right now \u2014 and a harbinger of what\u2019s to come. They should consider five lessons: 1) we\u2019re moving from models that recognize patterns to those that can reason, 2) the economics of AI are at an inflection point, 3) the current moment shows how propriety and open source models can coexist, 4) silicon scarcity drives innovation, and 5) in spite of the splash DeepSeek made with this model, it didn\u2019t change everything, and things like proprietary models\u2019 advantages over open source are still in place.",
    "DeepSeek\u2019s launch of its R1 model in late January 2025 triggered a sharp decline in market valuations across the AI value chain, from model developers to infrastructure providers. Investors saw R1, a powerful yet inexpensive challenger to established U.S. AI models, as a threat to the sky-high growth projections that had justified outsized valuations. For those who have been paying attention, however, the arrival of DeepSeek \u2014 or something like it \u2014 was inevitable.",
