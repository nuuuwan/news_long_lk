- **Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) in Sri Lanka:**
  - Agreement between GoSL and IMF includes a benchmark to enact a POCA by April 2024.
  - Framework report for POCA was released in April 2023.

- **Proposed Changes and Issues:**
  - Current framework aims to recover stolen assets but needs strengthening to prevent re-theft.
  - Risks of abuse of power and lack of public participation are major concerns.
  
- **Key Concerns:**
  - Risk of re-stealing in asset recovery processes.
  - Need for proper management and safeguarding of funds like PCMA and VCRTF.
  - High international examples of re-corruption emphasize the need for robust safeguards.
  
- **Safeguarding Due-Process:**
  - Proposed law needs a balance between swift recovery and protection of individuals' rights.
  - Concerns over procedural overreach and the potential for abuse by Sri Lankan officials.
  - More safeguards required, such as judicial sanctions for investigative actions.
  
- **Public Participation and Transparency:**
  - Enhancing public participation and legal standing in the asset recovery process is critical.
  - Framework should comply with UNCAC and GFAR principles to engage civil society.
  - Current framework limits public involvement and lacks transparency regarding information sharing.

- **Transparency Measures:**
  - Framework should align with Sri Lanka’s existing Right to Information Act.
  - Encourage public monitoring to prevent re-corruption.
  
- **Need for Public Consultation:**
  - Lack of public consultation in creating the framework is a significant oversight.
  - Addressing grand corruption requires dismantling entrenched networks, requiring political will.
  
- **Overall Recommendations:**
  - Four key improvements include stronger safeguards, public legal standing, enhanced transparency, and thorough public consultation.
  - Effective implementation needs overcoming resistance from powerful, politically connected individuals.
  
- **Conclusion:**
  - Solid start, but significant improvements needed for effective recovery and prevention of asset re-theft.
  - Important to not rush the process and guarantee the framework's robustness and public support.
