In our busy lives, it’s hard to find enough time to pause and reflect. But if we never make the time, we may just end up running fast in the wrong direction — and this is especially true when it comes to our careers. That’s why, once a quarter, it’s useful to run through this three-step exercise, or do a “career detox.” The first step involves turning inward and asking yourself a series of reflective questions focused on whether you’re still happy with your current path. The second step is all about naming your values, and the third is about aligning what you’ve learned to your career. Use this practice to figure out what might need to add or subtract from your work life to feel more satisfied in this moment.

As we transition from one season to the next, we should all be checking in on ourselves and how we feel at work to identify the areas where we can make a positive change. This might include adding something new to our routines or throwing away old habits that are no longer serving us.
