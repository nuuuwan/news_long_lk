    "In our busy lives, it\u2019s hard to find enough time to pause and reflect. But if we never make the time, we may just end up running fast in the wrong direction \u2014 and this is especially true when it comes to our careers. That\u2019s why, once a quarter, it\u2019s useful to run through this three-step exercise, or do a \u201ccareer detox.\u201d The first step involves turning inward and asking yourself a series of reflective questions focused on whether you\u2019re still happy with your current path. The second step is all about naming your values, and the third is about aligning what you\u2019ve learned to your career. Use this practice to figure out what might need to add or subtract from your work life to feel more satisfied in this moment.",
