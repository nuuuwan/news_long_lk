Toastmasters International Founder Dr. Ralph C. Smedley

On 22 October 2024, Toastmasters International marked a century of transforming lives through communication and leadership development. Founded in 1924 by Dr. Ralph C. Smedley in Santa Ana, California, Toastmasters began as a small gathering aimed at helping individuals hone their speaking skills. Over the years, it grew into a global movement, empowering millions of members to become confident communicators and leaders.

Dr. Smedley’s vision was simple yet profound: to create a supportive environment where people could practice public speaking and leadership in a structured manner. The first Toastmasters club laid the foundation for what would eventually become a worldwide organisation with over 16,000 clubs in 145 countries. Toastmasters International has remained committed to its core values—integrity, respect, service, and excellence—while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of its members. Today, the organisation plays a pivotal role in personal and professional development, fostering a culture of learning and growth.

As we celebrate this milestone, Toastmasters International reflects on a legacy of 100 years of excellence in communication, leadership, and personal growth. From its humble beginnings to a global force for change, the organisation has become a beacon for those seeking to improve their speaking abilities, lead teams, and make meaningful contributions to society.

District 82’s grand celebrations

In recognition of this historic occasion, District 82, which encompasses Sri Lanka, Maldives and the British Indian Ocean Territory, has planned a series of prestigious events that pay tribute to Toastmasters’ century of service. These events are designed to celebrate the organisation’s rich history and to inspire future generations of Toastmasters.

Bell ring at Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) – 22 October: The celebrations began with a symbolic bell-ringing ceremony at the Colombo Stock Exchange on the exact anniversary date. This event marked Toastmasters’ influence in the business and corporate sectors, highlighting how effective communication and leadership play an essential role in the success of industries across the globe. It also emphasised the organisation’s commitment to fostering professional development in all sectors.

Sit-down dinner at Galle Face Hotel – 25 October: To further honour this landmark event, District 82 will host a sit-down dinner at the iconic Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. This elegant evening will bring together Toastmasters, dignitaries, and special guests for a night of celebration, networking, and reflection on the organisation’s incredible journey. A commemorative postal cover will also be unveiled, cementing this special occasion in history.

“Smedley Walk” at Independence Square – 27 October: The anniversary festivities will conclude with the “Smedley Walk” at Independence Square, a walk that symbolises the continued journey of self-improvement and leadership that Toastmasters members embark on. The event is named after the founder, Ralph C. Smedley, and aims to remind participants of the legacy of learning and growth that Toastmasters has fostered for a century.

Through these initiatives, District 82 not only celebrates the past but also sets the stage for the future, encouraging new leaders to rise and carry forward the vision of Ralph C. Smedley. As we embark on the next 100 years, Toastmasters International will continue to be a transformative force, empowering individuals to find their voice and lead with confidence.
