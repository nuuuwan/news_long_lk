A report released by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has revealed that two of the world's largest publicly traded tobacco companies are advertising tobacco and nicotine products to kids on social media. The report shows that the companies have targeted over 60 countries with marketing campaigns for Velo, a nicotine pouch, an e-cigarette, and IQOS, a heated tobacco product. It's estimated that 40 percent of the audience engaging with these companies' marketing content are young people under the age of 25. In light of these findings, the report argues that governments must strengthen existing legal measures to comprehensively ban all forms of domestic and cross-border marketing of tobacco products, and hold social media companies legally accountable for allowing such advertisements on their platforms.
