# Global Outlook: the path ahead for the US economy

## Summary ü§ñ

In a Global Outlook video from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), economic experts discussed the future of the US economy. Though resilient so far, the US economy, struggling with inflation and high interest rates, could face more challenges ahead as the Federal Reserve tries to reduce inflation, which is currently above the target rate of 2%. According to the EIU's forecast, the Fed may cut rates later this year unless inflation persists. The forecast also mentioned the potential for unexpected developments due to unforeseen global events. The state of the economy is expected to influence the upcoming US elections, however, non-economic issues such as immigration are gaining importance among voters. The EIU expects a narrow reelection for President Biden due to his track record on economic growth and employment.

Global Outlook: the path ahead for the US economy

EconomyForecastingUS electionAmericasUnited StatesCountry Analysis

In EIU‚Äôs June 2024 Global Outlook video, head of global forecasting and economics, Tom Rafferty, and global principal economist, Steven Leslie, discuss the US economic outlook.

Despite stubborn inflation and still-high interest rates, the US economy has proved resilient so far in 2024. However, the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) will continue to try to cool the economy and reduce inflation. The target for inflation is 2% and it is currently above 3%, which is still too high. EIU expects US GDP growth to grow by 2.2% this year and by 1.8% in 2025.

‚ÄúEIU‚Äôs core forecast is that the Fed will cut rates in September and then again in December this year but risks remain. If inflation remains stubborn, it is possible that the Fed will hold rates throughout the year and there is a chance that it could even raise rates. As we have seen in recent years, for example with the covid-19 pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, unforeseen events could lead to unexpected outcomes.‚Äù

In addition, the US economic outlook will influence the upcoming US elections but to a lesser extent than traditionally seen. EIU narrowly expects Biden to be reelected as he has a strong story to tell on economic growth and employment rates. However, inflation and higher prices for basic goods are key factors affecting voting behaviour. There are also many non-economic issues, such as the culture wars over immigration, that are becoming increasingly important to voters.
