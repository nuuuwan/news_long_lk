In a Global Outlook video from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), economic experts discussed the future of the US economy. Though resilient so far, the US economy, struggling with inflation and high interest rates, could face more challenges ahead as the Federal Reserve tries to reduce inflation, which is currently above the target rate of 2%. According to the EIU's forecast, the Fed may cut rates later this year unless inflation persists. The forecast also mentioned the potential for unexpected developments due to unforeseen global events. The state of the economy is expected to influence the upcoming US elections, however, non-economic issues such as immigration are gaining importance among voters. The EIU expects a narrow reelection for President Biden due to his track record on economic growth and employment.
