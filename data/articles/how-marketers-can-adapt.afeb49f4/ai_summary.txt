Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Perplexity, and search portals like Google's Search Generative Experience or Bing's Copilot, could significantly change the search experience for customers from browsing links to receiving direct answers. This will allow customers to learn about products and brands through a more conversational experience. Marketers need to monitor this new information pipeline to ensure their brands are accurately represented. This advancement in LLMs could possibly challenge Google's 91% market share in the $50 billion market for search ads, the first potential disruption in over two decades.
