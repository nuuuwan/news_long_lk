As we prepare for the Presidential Election on September 21, we also need to reflect on other key issues including the violence that people undergo based on religion or belief. Highlighting this issue, the UN marks today, August 22, as International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief.

The UN underscores that the freedom of religion or belief, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of association are interdependent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing and are enshrined in articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The open, constructive and respectful debate of ideas, as well as interreligious, interfaith and intercultural dialogue, at all levels, can play a positive role in combating religious hatred, incitement and violence, the UN added. No doubt, the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can play a positive role in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance.

Political leaders and the 39 candidates contesting the Presidential Election need to give priority to issues such as this. They and we, the citizens, also need to remember the values of servant leadership as religious leaders and philosophers have told us that our care for others is a measure of our greatness. That means, our lives should show the virtues of love, peace, joy, patience, kindness, humility, meekness, faithfulness and gentleness. These virtues will go a long way in preventing or solving problems that arise from violence, whether it is within the family, neighbourhood, workplace, or even international issues such as the catastrophic conflict in west Asia and the war between Russia and Ukraine.

We need to remember that our views on various issues are always relative and never absolute. Therefore, we need to grow in the virtue of listening to the views of others with genuine care for them, so that our views and theirs will help find new solutions.

According to the UN, there are continuing acts of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, including against persons belonging to religious communities and religious minorities around the world, and the number and intensity of such incidents, which are often of a criminal nature and may have international characteristics, are increasing.

That is why the General Assembly adopted this resolution strongly condemning continuing violence and acts of terrorism targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities, on the basis of or in the name of religion or belief.

In their statement, the UN strongly deplored all acts of violence against persons on the basis of their religion or belief, as well as any such acts directed against their homes, businesses, properties, schools, cultural centres or places of worship, as well as all attacks on and in religious places, sites and shrines that are in violation of international law.

A previous UN resolution establishing the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism also recognised that working together to enhance the implementation of existing legal regimes that protect individuals against discrimination and hate crimes, increasing interreligious, interfaith and intercultural efforts and expanding human rights education are important first steps in combating incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence against individuals on the basis of religion or belief.

As Martin Luther King Jr said, “Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time; the need for mankind to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence.”

We sincerely hope that this spirit of nonviolence and respect for the views and policies of others will bring about a peaceful election campaign in Sri Lanka and there will be little or no post-election violence as we have often seen.
