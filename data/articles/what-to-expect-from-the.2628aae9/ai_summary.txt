🗳️ Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, has recently become Prime Minister following the general election on July 4th.
📚 Starmer’s cabinet consists of most of his previous shadow cabinet members who have similar roles and their policy announcements echo Labour’s campaign manifesto.
💼 Starmer’s new ministers bring significant experience and a majority in parliament, which puts the government in a good position to pass controversial bills about North Sea energy policy and planning reform. 
🚑 Improving public services, especially the National Health Service (NHS), will be a challenge due to fiscal limitations and lack of consensus on the best course of action. 
🇪🇺 Labour's foreign policy will be more pro-EU compared to the Conservative Party, while also strongly supporting NATO and Ukraine.
💨 Labour is targeting policies linked to Conservative failure, like reversing the effective ban on onshore wind farms. 
🏡 Plans to address the UK's housing shortage include reforming the National Planning Policy Framework, reintroducing council housebuilding targets, and reconsidering building on the green belt. 
🏛️ Starmer’s agenda, revealed in The King’s Speech on July 17th, focuses on institutional reform in planning and energy policy to boost economic growth, despite the complexities of these areas. 
🚧 Challenges are expected in improving public services and prison reform, anticipating only moderate progress due to the scale of planned spending and overcrowding issues. 
🌐 Starmer aims to reset relations with the EU and strengthen the UK's international standing, moving towards a more pro-EU stance than the Conservative Party. 

Note: this summarization is based on a hypothetical scenario where Keir Starmer is the Prime Minister.
