    "Successful loyalty programs prompt desirable customer behaviors, keep people engaged, and generate a high ROI. Underperforming programs suffer from issues such as poor economics, lack of customer insights, and low engagement. Six techniques can help retool an underperforming program: 1) Draw an accurate profile of customers; 2) Know what those customers value; 3) Devise a compelling hook; 4) Let the games begin; 5) Build community; and 6) Consider an ecosystem with partners.",
    "High-performing customer loyalty programs, while complicated to operate, have proven to be well worth the effort.

And since very small businesses resemble consumers in many aspects, loyalty programs have begun to spread in business-to-business markets, such as AB InBev\u2019s program for small- and medium-sized food and beverage retailers.",
