Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping seek to create a new, multi-polar world order to counter U.S. global dominance and also want their nations to be taken seriously on the international stage. This followed China's aid during the U.S.-led sanction on Russia due to the Ukraine crisis. Both countries, although are not superpowers, bear significant influence in the world. Unlike in the past, Putin and Xi's vision is not of military domination but of using trade to create their influence. For instance, China's ambition involves counteracting the U.S. through trade. Furthermore, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's designs on Taiwan are seen as their domestic affairs. Despite this, U.S. pressure on the EU over China's tech and AI capability cannot be ignored, while the second wave of U.S. sanction on the Asian nations have also increased tension. However, Russia needs China's financial aid and both of them aim to challenge American hegemony.
