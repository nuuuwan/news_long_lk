Softening US labour market presages slowdown

EconomyForecastingAmericasGlobalUnited StatesCountry Analysis

EIU forecasts that the US labour market will remain strong by historical standards, but will continue to weaken in the second half of 2024.

The deterioration in key labour market indicators, such as the hires and quits rate, predicts a further rise in unemployment. We now forecast an average unemployment rate in 2025 of 4.3% (up from 4.2% last month).

Although a significant increase in unemployment is not our core scenario, if these indicators continue to tick down, we expect a larger contraction in employment rather than a narrowly missed “soft landing”.

We judge that monetary policy is overly restrictive relative to the level of slack in the labour market. We therefore believe that although 75 basis points of interest rate cuts this year is the most likely scenario, there are downside risks and the Federal Reserve (Fed, the central bank) may bring forward further easing, especially if the August jobs report shows a further rise in unemployment. We judge a “higher for longer” scenario now to be a low likelihood.

Increased slack in the labour market will tilt the balance towards firms in wage negotiations, but higher unemployment will dampen consumer demand. We expect highly cyclical industries like construction and manufacturing to suffer more than less cyclical sectors like healthcare and education services.

The August 2nd US jobs report showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July, the fourth consecutive monthly uptick and the highest rate in almost three years. We believe that although employment remains strong, the increase in the unemployment rate is part of a broader softening of the US labour market, increasing our assessment of downside risks to the US macroeconomic outlook.

The US labour market is historically strong but showing signs of slowing

Even after Friday’s jobs report, we continue to emphasise the historic strength of employment in the US. The prime-aged employment/population ratio (EPOP) stands at 80.9%, higher than at any time since the start of the 2001 recession. This is an astonishing macroeconomic achievement that defies many previous estimates of what was achievable in the US labour market. In July EPOP increased by 0.1 percentage points from June (although the full population measure ticked down slightly in the same month).

However, despite the continuing strength of the employment rate, several key labour market indicators are now deteriorating. The hires and quits rates (the number of workers hired and quitting during the month as a percentage of employment) are both falling, indicating a lower willingness among firms to take on new workers and of workers to quit their job to take on a new one.

Wage growth has also slowed significantly. The employment cost index (ECI, considered by the Fed to be the highest-quality measure of compensation growth) showed that wages and salaries for private-sector workers, excluding incentive pay, grew by 4.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 4.2% in the first quarter and by 4.8% on 2023. The second-quarter figure was also buoyed by the higher rate of growth for unionised workers, who saw year-on-year growth of 6.5%, compared with just 3.8% for non-unionised workers. This rate of growth is likely to be the peak, as organised action by labour has fallen significantly from last year’s highs.

Key labour market indicators suggest a worsening of economic conditions

The deterioration of key labour market indicators provides an insight into the future direction of the US economy. The quits rate in particular performs well, predicting the future path of the unemployment rate. This has an intuitive logic. Workers often have a good sense of their own local economic conditions. When conditions begin to worsen, they will often opt to stay in their current role because new opportunities look less attractive or simply do not exist. The process of “staying put” often takes place before firms begin formally laying off workers. Quits have the further advantage of being more statistically reliable than some other measures, including job openings, which are often difficult to accurately measure owing to misreporting from firms.

A simple six-month lag of the quits rate predicts the unemployment rate well, including the current unemployment rate. The relationship is non-linear, which should be of particular concern to policymakers, as it suggests that as the quits rate continues to fall, corresponding increases to the unemployment rate will accelerate. A similar dynamic is observed in other labour market indicators. We forecast that the unemployment rate will average 4.1% for 2024. In the light of worsening labour market conditions, we will revise up our forecast unemployment rate for 2025 to 4.3% (from 4.2% last month). Although a significant rise in unemployment is not our core scenario, should labour outcomes continue to fall off, we expect a larger contraction in employment rather than a narrowly missed “soft landing”.

Monetary policy is tight relative to the condition of the labour market

The risk of a larger correction in employment is also increasing, because we judge that monetary policy is tight relative to prevailing labour conditions. At the beginning of the 2021-23 inflation shock the labour market, as measured by the ratio of quits to the unemployment rate, tightened sharply. Since then it has remained tighter than at any other time this century. Starting in 2023 and in response to a more restrictive monetary policy, the labour market has started to normalise and has now returned to its historical range. Despite this, monetary policy has remained restrictive, and now the situation is statistically similar to the period preceding the start of the global financial crisis.

The relationship between monetary policy and wages shows a similar pattern. The difference between the Fed’s interest rate and wage growth is now at its largest since the global financial crisis. This indicates that workers will increasingly come under pressure from firms facing higher funding costs for as long as the Fed maintains its restrictive monetary policy stance. We therefore believe that although 75 basis points of interest-rate cuts this year is the most likely scenario, there are moderate downside risks, and the Fed may bring forward further easing this year if the labour market continues to slacken. We judge a “higher for longer” scenario now as a low likelihood. The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, due on September 4th, and the August jobs data, due on September 6th, will be important data points, especially if the jobs report shows a further worsening of the unemployment rate.

Inflation is back within target, with no significant real economic impact

The Fed has justified its current stance on the basis that inflation, as measured by personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, remains above its target of 2%. We believe that continuing to keep policy tight to achieve this “last mile” of inflation reduction will further compound risks to the labour market. Inflation increased significantly in response to the tight labour market and supply shocks of 2021. As with other macroeconomic variables, the relationship stipulated by the Phillips curve often exhibits non-linear dynamics as well; when inflation is low and stable, individuals and firms pay less attention to it, leading to muted responses in wage and price-setting. Conversely, when inflation is higher and more variable, it captures more attention, causing more pronounced adjustments in wages and prices. A rapid rise in inflation means a quick decline is also possible, as happened in 2022-23 when the Fed raised interest rates and the supply shock dissipated. However, this process stalled in the summer of 2023, and CPI, measured as the year-on-year percentage change, has not significantly changed since then. PCE growth has continued to slow, but the rate of declaration declined significantly at the same point as CPI did, in June 2023.

As the Phillips curve shows, further reductions in inflation would probably require a significant rise in unemployment relative to recent rises, a risk that we judge the Fed will weigh significantly when assessing its “dual mandate” objective. Technical wage-price setting dynamics further support this view. For instance, continuing high inflation in services relative to goods substantially explains the current inflation overshoot. Services are labour-intensive and exhibit inelastic demand. Reducing the cost of labour inputs is therefore directly related to slowing services inflation. Given that nominal wages tend to exhibit downward “stickiness” (workers tend not to accept outright cuts in their pay), substantial unemployment would be required to achieve this effect.

The outlook has important implications for firms

Increased slack in the labour market will tilt wage negotiation dynamics towards firms. In addition to slowing nominal wage growth, real wages are still below the pre-pandemic period. A weaker labour market will reduce workers’ bargaining power as they opt to stay in their employment through the slowdown in activity. But the slowing labour market will also affect consumer demand. We expect highly cyclical industries like construction and manufacturing to suffer more than less cyclical sectors like healthcare and education services.
