    "While shopping online for your son\u2019s holiday gift, you stumble across a cashmere scarf from an unfamiliar retailer. You\u2019re checking out as a new customer, and the site requests your contact, shipping, billing, and payment information. You don\u2019t have your credit card number handy, so you leave the checkout frustrated\u2014without buying the scarf.",
    "Sales are lost in scenarios like this all too frequently. In fact, the average online shopping-cart abandonment rate is higher than 70%, according to the Baymard Institute.",
    "Shoppers don\u2019t finish checking out for a variety of reasons, including:",
    "\u2022 The requirement to create an account",
    "\u2022 A lack of trust around payment information security",
    "\u2022\u00a0A long, complicated checkout process",
    "To convert new or existing customers, businesses cannot overlook the guest checkout experience\u2014particularly around the holiday season, when guest-shopper traffic is highest.",
    "Improving Guest Checkouts",
    "Simply offering guest checkout is not enough to improve customer experience. Guest shoppers still need to complete multiple form fields, which makes the process notoriously cumbersome. Businesses that invest in speeding up and easing this experience can convert more customers.",
    "A streamlined guest checkout process should offer:",
    "\u2022 Early guest recognition that can quickly identify shoppers and their payment preferences",
    "\u2022 Pre-filled customer information that automatically supplies a shopper\u2019s email address and payment, shipping, and billing information",
    "\u2022 Checkout speed that allows shoppers to finalize transactions in as little as one click",
    "Sixty-six percent of customers expect to check out in four minutes or less, according to Capterra, and each innovation can shave precious time off the checkout experience. Taken together, these improvements can help a business drive conversion and deliver an ideal shopping experience for all customers.",
    "Speed Powered by Data",
    "The key to fast guest checkout is data, including access to information about customers\u2019 purchase history, credentials, and payment information.",
    "\u201cThe ability to recognize verified shoppers is what makes a fast, one-click guest checkout experience possible. And it\u2019s only possible with the right breadth and depth of data,\u201d says Mike Sutter, SVP and head of checkout at PayPal. \u201cYou need the scale and trust of a large network to truly accelerate the process.\u201d",
    "Ensuring customer trust around data is equally important. Customers aren\u2019t comfortable giving their personal information to just anyone. A majority will only buy from companies that have a reputation for protecting data, according to McKinsey. Businesses need to align with payment service providers known for taking data privacy seriously.",
    "More Checkouts, More Conversion",
    "A speedy checkout doesn\u2019t just enable a convenient buyer experience. It can also lead to more completed checkouts, lower cart abandonment rates, improved authorization rates, and higher conversion rates. Importantly, it can also drive higher customer satisfaction, which can encourage customers to return.",
    "The concept of a high-speed guest checkout isn\u2019t new. Solutions are already available. But they all differ in the scale of their data network and their access to it.",
    "Fastlane by PayPal is the only accelerated guest checkout solution that is powered by the scale and credibility of PayPal\u2019s immense network, with 550 million cards securely stored. Businesses that use Fastlane can recognize shoppers and let them pay in seconds.",
    "\u201cEffective guest checkout solutions should balance ease of use with robust security measures,\u201d says Sutter. \u201cBy recognizing returning customers and allowing for quick, one-click payments, businesses can create a smoother, more satisfying shopping experience.\u201d",
    "The holidays are just around the corner, and guest traffic is about to soar. A high-speed guest checkout may be the make-or-break element of the season. Now\u2019s the time for businesses to examine their checkout processes and consider how they can improve customer experience with an accelerated guest checkout.",
