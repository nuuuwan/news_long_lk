    "What\u2019s happened?Malaysia has signed a strategic partnership with Arm Holdings, a UK-based chip architecture company, to acquire advanced semiconductor design blueprints for US$250m. The\u00a0agreement, spread over ten years, includes training for 10,000 local engineers and aims to transition Malaysia\u2019s dominant role in chip assembly and testing to high-value semiconductor design.\u00a0While Malaysia will gain access to Arm\u2019s blueprints and will be successful in manufacturing more higher-valued semiconductors, EIU believes that the country\u2019s goal of creating its own designs will be\u00a0challenging.Why does it matter?This partnership marks a significant step forward for Malaysia\u2019s\u00a0semiconductor ambitions.\u00a0The\u00a0country has been a major player in semiconductor assembly, packaging and testing for decades, accounting for an estimated 13% of these downstream activities globally. However, chip design\u2014the\u00a0higher-value-added segment of the semiconductor supply chain\u2014is dominated by Taiwan, South Korea and the US.Access to Arm\u2019s chip designs will allow Malaysia to develop domestic capabilities in semiconductor intellectual property (IP) and innovation, potentially reducing reliance on foreign technology. In\u00a0the long term, this move will enhance Malaysia\u2019s role in the global chip supply chain, allowing it to capture a larger share of semiconductor value\u00a0creation.However, Malaysia faces considerable challenges in executing this strategy. Semiconductor design is a highly specialised field, requiring deep technical expertise and long-term investment in research and development; it is still a nascent discipline in Malaysia\u2019s institutes of higher learning.\u00a0Retaining the engineers trained under the agreement\u00a0will be difficult.\u00a0\u201cBrain drain\u201d is a persistent issue, with many of Malaysia\u2019s top engineers seeking higher salaries and better career prospects abroad. Without competitive compensation and career pathways, Malaysia risks losing its best talent before its chip design industry can fully take\u00a0off.Another major challenge is funding and commercialisation. Unlike Taiwan and South Korea, which have strong venture capital ecosystems supporting semiconductor start-ups, Malaysia lacks a deep pool of private-sector investors willing to take on the risks associated with chip design.\u00a0The\u00a0government will need to provide sustained financial support to early-stage chip firms, but there is a risk that these companies will struggle to compete\u00a0globally.\u00a0What next?The immediate goal for the government is to identify local companies with the capabilities and expertise to begin manufacturing. Malaysia will focus on integrating its new chip design ecosystem with global supply chains. We expect the establishment of an integrated-circuit design park at Selangor and the\u00a0Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone\u00a0to\u00a0increase the presence of higher-value-added semiconductor activity. In\u00a0the long term, Malaysia aims to leverage Arm\u2019s IP to design custom chips for emerging technologies such as the internet of things or artificial intelligence.\u00a0However, a\u00a0more realistic outcome would be that Malaysia remains dependent on licensed designs, manufacturing higher-value semiconductors but not innovating at the cutting\u00a0edge.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
