    "President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake",
    "By locking in fiscal consolidation while redirecting expenditure toward high-impact, productivity-enhancing projects, the Government aims not only to recover the economic output lost during the crisis but also to place Sri Lanka on a fundamentally stronger, more resilient, and technology-driven path. Its success will now depend entirely on efficient, transparent execution\u2014a challenge the budget seeks to mitigate through its own commitment to digital governance and zero tolerance for corruption. In short, along with the 2026 Budget, President AKD is heading in the right direction to reach \u201cA thriving Nation and a Beautiful Life\u201d",
    "Introduction: The pivot to productive equilibrium",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s Budget 2026, presented on 7 November, signals a clear shift from crisis management to strategic economic transformation. The main message is that fiscal consolidation and inclusive development are not opposing priorities but essential, interconnected elements for long-term national resilience.",
    "The Budget successfully navigates the challenging dual mandate of meeting international fiscal requirements (IMF targets) while urgently addressing domestic welfare and infrastructure needs. Macroeconomic targets are clear: the deficit is set at 5.2% of GDP, and the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 95% by 2026, anchoring stability. Simultaneously, growth is aggressively targeted at 7% annually through investment and productivity-led expansion.",
    "The balance is evident in the allocations: major investments in digital infrastructure, healthcare, and education lay the groundwork for a knowledge economy, while significant financial packages for housing, rural roads, and public servant benefits directly inject relief and opportunity into the grassroots economy.

This section focuses on the rigorous fiscal targets and revenue-enhancing reforms designed to ensure long-term sustainability.",
    "The continuation of the IMF-backed fiscal consolidation program is non-negotiable, targeting a primary surplus and reducing the Debt-to-GDP ratio to 95% by 2026, with a further ambitious reduction to 87% by 2030.

This disciplined financial framework provides the platform for the Government to launch its growth initiatives.",
