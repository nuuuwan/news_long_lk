    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Lately, the vibes have been good for nuclear power. Public support is building, and public and private funding have made the technology more economical in key markets. There\u2019s also a swell of interest from major companies looking to power their data centers.\u00a0 Related StoryWhat\u2019s next for nuclear powerGlobal shifts, advancing tech, and data center demand: Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming in 2025 and beyond.",
    "These shifts have been great for existing nuclear plants. We\u2019re seeing efforts to boost their power output, extend the lifetime of old reactors, and even reopen facilities that have shut down. That\u2019s good news for climate action, because nuclear power plants produce consistent electricity with very low greenhouse-gas emissions. I covered all these trends in my latest story, which digs into what\u2019s next for nuclear power in 2025 and beyond. But as I spoke with experts, one central question kept coming up for me: Will all of this be enough to actually get new reactors built?",
    "To zoom in on some of these trends, let\u2019s take a look at the US, which has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors in the world (and the oldest, with an average age of over 42 years). In recent years we\u2019ve seen a steady improvement in public support for nuclear power in the US. Today, around 56% of Americans support more nuclear power, up from 43% in 2020, according to a Pew Research poll.",
    "The economic landscape has also shifted in favor of the technology. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes tax credits specifically for operating nuclear plants, aimed at keeping them online. Qualifying plants can receive up to $15 per megawatt-hour, provided they meet certain labor requirements. (For context, in 2021, its last full year of operation, Palisades in Michigan generated over 7 million megawatt-hours.)\u00a0 Big Tech has also provided an economic boost for the industry\u2014tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are all making deals to get in on nuclear. These developments have made existing (or recently closed) nuclear power plants a hot commodity. Plants that might have been candidates for decommissioning just a few years ago are now candidates for license extension. Plants that have already shut down are seeing a potential second chance at life. There\u2019s also the potential to milk more power out of existing facilities through changes called uprates, which basically allow existing facilities to produce more energy by tweaking existing instruments and power generation systems. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved uprates totaling six gigawatts over the past two decades. That\u2019s a small but certainly significant fraction of the roughly 97 gigawatts of nuclear on the grid today.\u00a0  Any reactors kept online, reopened, or ramped up spell good news for emissions. But expanding the nuclear fleet in the US will require not just making the most of existing assets, but building new reactors.\u00a0 We\u2019ll probably also need new reactors just to maintain the current fleet, since so many reactors are scheduled to be retired in the next couple of decades. Will the enthusiasm for keeping old plants running also translate into building new ones?\u00a0 Related StoryWhy Microsoft made a deal to help restart Three Mile IslandA once-shuttered nuclear plant could soon return to the grid.",
    "In much of the world (China being a notable exception), building new nuclear capacity has historically been expensive and slow. It\u2019s easy to point at Plant Vogtle in the US: The third and fourth reactors at that facility began construction in 2009. They were originally scheduled to start up in 2016 and 2017, at a cost of around $14 billion. They actually came online in 2023 and 2024, and the total cost of the project was north of $30 billion. Some advanced technology has promised to fix the problems in nuclear power. Small modular reactors could help cut cost and construction times, and next-generation reactors promise safety and efficiency improvements that could translate to cheaper, quicker construction. Realistically, though, getting these first-of-their-kind projects off the ground will still require a lot of money and a sustained commitment to making them happen. \u201cThe next four years are make or break for advanced nuclear,\u201d says Jessica Lovering, cofounder at the Good Energy Collective, a policy research organization that advocates for the use of nuclear energy.",
    "There are a few factors that could help the progress we\u2019ve seen recently in nuclear extend to new builds. For one, public support from the US Department of Energy includes not only tax credits but public loans and grants for demonstration projects, which can be a key stepping stone to commercial plants that generate electricity for the grid.\u00a0 Changes to the regulatory process could also help. The Advance Act, passed in 2024, aims at sprucing up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the hopes of making the approval process more efficient (currently, it can take up to five years to complete).\u00a0 \u201cIf you can see the NRC really start to modernize toward a more efficient, effective, and predictable regulator, it really helps the case for a lot of these commercial projects, because the NRC will no longer be seen as this barrier to innovation,\u201d says Patrick White, research director at the Nuclear Innovation Alliance, a nonprofit think tank. We should start to see changes from that legislation this year, though what happens could depend on the Trump administration. The next few years are crucial for next-generation nuclear technology, and how the industry fares between now and the end of the decade could be very telling when it comes to how big a role this technology plays in our longer-term efforts to decarbonize energy.\u00a0   Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading For more on what\u2019s next for nuclear power, check out my latest story.
