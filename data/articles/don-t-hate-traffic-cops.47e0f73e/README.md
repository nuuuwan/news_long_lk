We love the police despite these law enforcement officers wearing an intimidating colour like khaki. Former IGP Pujith Jayasundara once mooted the idea of changing the police uniform to light blue, which is the colour of the police uniform in most European countries. But that idea never came to being implemented. By the way, light blue is a much friendlier colour than khaki.

The word ‘implement’ is so closely imbedded in the policeman’s jargon. Whether one likes it or not these policemen can be ruthless during the festive season; just to ensure there is safety in society and especially on the road where drivers and cars rule the roost. Just the other day, law enforcement officers nabbed 251 drunk drivers in an initiative which was carried out by the police. The goal behind the initiative was to improve road safety and reduce accidents. The initiative which commenced on December 23 will continue throughout the festive season.

Such an initiative brings with it much concern because it gives a clear message; don’t drink and drive. This little island is not Saudi Arabia, a country where any form of association with liquor is banned. So Sri Lankans will consume liquor and make merry during the festive season. But that doesn’t give anyone the licence to get behind the wheel under the influence of liquor. As many as 251 people being nabbed within a 24-hour period by the traffic police for breaching the law of drinking and driving is alarming!

Critics opine that these traffic law offenders should be slapped with heavy fines and banned from driving for a lengthy period of time. During this above mentioned police operation, a total of over 9000 drivers breached traffic laws and will have to face court cases.

This is a country where most individuals lack the upbringing to think about the other. If a drunken driver loses control of his vehicle, there is a great risk of the driver injuring not only himself but also a passer-by on the road. There must be more comprehensive laws to protect and even compensate the passer-by on the road in the event of an accident. This writer says so because there have been numerous occasions when drunk drivers knock down passers-by and drive away leaving the injured people to face the ordeal from there onwards, all alone.

During this new initiative, the police will check on cases where passenger transport vehicle drivers are reckless, speed traffic violations, mechanical defects in vehicles and whether tyres are worn out and are unsafe. The police have vouched to work around the clock to enforce traffic laws.

Another initiative taken by the police is to ensure that traffic police wear luminous gear when they are on duty at night. Research has proved that spotting a police officer in luminous attire and giving instructions to stop can help drivers to bring their vehicles to a safe stop as opposed to flash lights being pointed right in the face. The latter method brings with it dangers of drivers having their vision obstructed; hence there is potential for an accident and the culprit could be the policeman on duty.

We also come to know that the Sri Lanka Police has taken steps to distribute 150,000 breathalyser kits to police stations around the country. This news in itself is a deterrent to drivers of vehicles who have invitations for year- end parties and have the intention of driving their own vehicles for these events. Such invitees should seriously think of using alternate modes of transport for both sessions of the journey.

It was 35 years ago in the month of December (1989-12-3) that comedian and actor Nihal Silva was shot dead in Dehiwala by security forces for ignoring commands to stop his vehicle for a spot-check. Wikipedia explains in the ‘cause of death paragraph’ relating to the artiste that the late Nihal Silva ‘didn’t possibly understand the situation due to inebriation’. On Google this word means ‘behaviour and physical effects caused by an overdose of alcohol poisoning’. What a state to be in when behind the steering wheel!
