1Ô∏è‚É£ The accumulated debt in Sri Lanka is disproportionately burdening citizens in the lower and middle income scales. 
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ The Sri Lankan government has not provided a balance sheet for public view regarding the borrowing and spending of borrowed money. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has taken control of Sri Lanka‚Äôs economic policy direction and negotiated a ‚Äúfair‚Äù $8 million debt relief. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ The IMF‚Äôs primary aim is to ensure debtor nations gain enough financial strength to settle total debt. 

5Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka's strategic location in the Indian Ocean makes it a crucial foothold for American and Western interests, impacting the debt relief granted. 

6Ô∏è‚É£ All foreign debt is settled by producing a national surplus, either through a trade or budget surplus, areas where Sri Lanka faces chronic issues. 

7Ô∏è‚É£ The IMF has yet to incentivise or resource the domestic production sector, focusing on reducing fiscal deficit instead. 

8Ô∏è‚É£ The next Sri Lankan budget is expected to cut public expenditure and increase revenue, further impacting lower and middle-income citizens. 

9Ô∏è‚É£ The fields of health and education are expected to continue to suffer from lack of resources, causing economic distress for the majority of the population. 

üîü The current political climate is creating unease among both citizens and shareholders of the IMF, as mass protests are likely if elections are postponed or canceled.
