The tea industry has been the backbone of Sri Lanka's economy for years, serving as the third highest earner for the country behind earnings of expatriate workers and the textile trade. Despite a drop in production due to a fertiliser shortage caused by an agrochemical ban, tea export earnings increased by 3.57% to $111.12 Mn in December 2023, compared to the previous year. From January to April 2024, export earnings rose by 10.44% to $450.23 million. However, the workers responsible for these earnings are poorly paid and live in conditions that the late Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel described as unfit for human habitation. Many do not have access to safe drinking water or sanitary toilet facilities, and around 65% are among the poorest households in the country. The announcement of President Wickremesinghe to increase the wage of estate workers to Rs. 1,700 per day was met with strong opposition from the Plantersâ€™ Association of Ceylon.
