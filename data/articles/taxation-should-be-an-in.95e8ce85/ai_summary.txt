Opinions:

- The perspective of taxation as a part of a social contract between a government and the people who pay tax should be adopted. 
- It’s disturbing that a national dialogue on taxation in Sri Lanka took such a long time to occur. 
- Raising taxes is a hard and perhaps unfair approach to increasing income since the country is already heavily reliant on tax revenue. 
- Sri Lanka needs to improve in areas like increasing exports and investments, industrialisation, agriculture, and sustainable energy projects. These are long-term projects requiring strategic policies and plans. 
- A fair tax system should ensure that both low- and middle-income individuals as well as high-income individuals are taxed equitably. 
- The state should not curb free enterprise, but citizens should contribute towards the fundamental values of the country, including a universal healthcare system and a free education system. 
- Sri Lanka should encourage taxpayers to invest in specific government or semi-government ventures for tax deductions. 
- The country could benefit from studying and implementing Singapore's approach to managing its economy. 
- It's urgently suggested that Sri Lanka establish state-owned investment entities, allowing for tax-deductible public investments and subsequent social and financial rewards.
