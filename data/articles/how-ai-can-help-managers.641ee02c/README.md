With organizations gaining wider access to conversational gen AI models, many managers now understand that the technology can go far beyond simple productivity tasks. Two-thirds of managers now believe that gen AI has the potential to be their thought partner, providing fresh perspectives, weighing pros and cons, evaluating trade-offs, enhancing strategic thinking, and supporting leadership development. But while expectations for the future are high, there is a long way to go. Today only 30% of managers report that they have the skills and knowledge to use gen AI in this way.

Fortunately, managers can bridge the gap quickly. Based on our experience, countless conversations, and through thousands of iterations of prompts, we have created an HBR Guide with instructions and tools to help managers use any conversational gen AI tool as a thought partner.

With these techniques, humans and AI working together can achieve high-quality outcomes that would not be possible working separately. We call this process “co-thinking,” and this article will show you how to get started.

The Power of Co-Thinking

Gen AI can be used as a thought partner for anything from speech preparation to root-cause analysis to strategy formulation. Let’s look at a few examples:

Mario is a project manager at a manufacturing plant, and he and his team often must solve technical challenges. Uncovering root causes of problems is a recurring, yet complex task. Mario has designed a structured dialogue with gen AI to help him think through each problem. Whenever a new one arises, he fine-tunes and tests his prompt sequence.

Kim is a communications manager at a large consumer goods company. She has been using gen AI both to draft press releases and to weigh how different stakeholders might react to them. Kim engages in a two-way conversation asking gen AI to act as specific stakeholders and debate with her about the content of each draft. Kim’s rule of thumb is to challenge and be challenged by AI during the dialogue.

Amy is a finance leader at a large technology company who is tasked with promoting a change initiative that will transform her department from an internal service provider into a strategic partner for business units. Amy has created a gen AI prompt sequence that her team members can run to help them understand and reflect on how to embrace the new mindset and behaviors that this initiative will require.

These stories shed light on a way of interacting with AI that goes far beyond simply answering questions or pushing a button and getting an output. It involves an active back-and-forth conversation, examples of which can be seen in the below table, where both the human and the AI contribute ideas and build upon each other’s thoughts at every step of the dialogue.

The value of a co-thinking dialogue is not only in the output but also in the dialogue itself — in fact value is co-created through the various steps of the human–AI conversation.

Executives in many roles have spoken about using gen AI as a co-thinker. Masayoshi Son of Softbank has said, “I am chatting with ChatGPT every day,” brainstorming new ideas and business strategies. Jeff Maggioncalda of Coursera called gen AI “an incredible thought partner changing the way I do my job.”

Outside the C-suite, we met managers at all levels who embrace co-thinking. Valentin Marguet, a project manager at Ferrari, shared that “For technical problem-solving, generative AI can act as a co-thinking partner, serving as a methodological expert while guiding structured thought processes to systematically explore root causes.” We believe that these approaches can help any leader or manager and that the time to start is now.

How to Design a Co-Thinking Dialogue with AI

We have created a four-step framework to help managers successfully design a co-thinking dialogue with gen AI.

Step 1: Assign a role to AI. Define the specific role you want AI to take, such as acting like an expert, a team member, or a devil’s advocate. Use introductory phrases like “Act as…”, “Help me…”, “The output of the dialogue will be…”, etc.

Step 2: Define the setting. Choose the setting in which you’d like the conversation to take place. Who is taking part in the conversation? Should it be a one-to-one interaction between you and AI or as a one-to-many interaction (for example, at a team meeting or workshop)?

Step 3: Outline the dialogue. Envision a sequence of questions and statements that will clarify who does what between you and the AI. Define closely what the AI will bring and what the human will bring; leaving the flow of the dialogue to chance increases the risk that it will go off track.

Step 4: Create the prompt. Write the prompt based on the outline you drafted. You can use gen AI to help you refine the prompt further, for instance you can type in the chat: “I have this outline of a dialogue and need your help turning it into a structured prompt that you can run with me: ‘[insert your outline here].’”

The sidebar “Two Co-Thinking Dialogues to Try” shows you two prompts that were created using this framework. We encourage you to copy and paste them into any gen AI model of your choosing and start your dialogue now. After you have proceeded through the dialogue once, try modifying the prompt to address a professional challenge you are facing — or design a new dialogue from scratch. The more you experiment with co-thinking dialogues, the faster your skills will improve.

Getting the Most out of Your Gen AI Dialogues

Our research brought us into contact Jessica Tompkinson, a former global head of communications and corporate affairs at Unilever Operations. She shared some of her ups and downs of learning to use gen AI as a co-thinker. “Looking back at my first prompts, what was coming back was useless for what I needed. I had to change my approach and started to converse with gen AI like I would a colleague or an agency. The back-and-forth conversation significantly improved the outcome and allowed the tools to learn more in the process.”

As you begin to use gen AI as a co-thinker, expect mixed results at first. Following the best practices in this list of do’s and don’ts can help accelerate your learning curve.

Embrace a conversational mindset: Approach gen AI as if you’re talking to a human collaborator. The machine can operate similarly to the Socratic method, enhancing your critical thinking through dialogue. You can prompt gen AI to drive you through a structured dialogue about a topic or issue you choose, elaborating on your answers, adding overlooked dimensions, and leading to follow-up questions.

Participate actively: You must engage with the machine in a back-and-forth interaction. Both parties contribute with feedback and mutual challenges, and ultimately co-create the output together. To receive appropriate advice, tailored answers, and helpful suggestions, start by providing a brief and accurate overview of your situation with clear context. Then, build on it by engaging actively — share your reflections and personal experiences, and ask follow-up questions.

Challenge the AI: As in a dialogue with a human, some friction in the thinking process is valuable. Ask the AI to provide different perspectives, ideas, or overlooked options. Don’t stop at the first generated output or conform too quickly to what the AI gives you. For example, ask “Are we missing any important aspects?” Or, “What if we looked at this problem from the point of view of …?”

Go it alone: When people work predominantly alone with generative AI, rather than actively involving and engaging with human teammates, it can reduce interpersonal communication and knowledge sharing within the team. This can hinder team-based judgment and the ability to prevent and mitigate risks. Take breaks from solo AI interactions to engage face-to-face with teammates, involve other colleagues in the AI-aided process, seek feedback from experts, integrate diverse viewpoints, and encourage peer learning.

Go too fast: You may tend to type, click, or advance too hastily. The speed at which gen AI executes can lead humans to rush through without reflection. Request AI to help you pause and reflect: Explicitly prompt AI to ask for your feedback, ensuring you have time to reflect and validate before moving forward.

Soon, managers who develop their gen AI capabilities will be leaping ahead of managers who don’t. It’s time to get your hands dirty with gen AI, understanding how to use it for yourself, your team, and the business. Identify tasks where to experiment with co-thinking. Prioritize, keep track of the benefits, the risks, and lessons learned, and share among your team. It’s your job to act as a co-thinking role model, encouraging your team to discuss what is going well and what could be improved, and collecting learnings in a structured way as technology evolves.
