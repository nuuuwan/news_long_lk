While the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is recognized by economists, many continue to hold an optimistic view of its impact on labor markets, based on the historical belief that technology makes economies more productive and opens new fields for workers. However, a growing body evidence indicating digital technology's contribution to increased global inequality is challenging this consensus. Research shows that, while technology has improved productivity, particularly for knowledge workers, it has also eroded demand for middle-wage jobs such as clerical positions. Some economists are therefore revising their models to stress that technology could potentially lower wages for all workers. The future impact of AI on the workforce will hinge on its ability to create new forms of work that humans can excel at, and on ensuring worker input is included in decision-making processes.
