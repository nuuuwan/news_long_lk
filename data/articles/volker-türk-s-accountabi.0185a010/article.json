    "United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner Volker T\u00fcrk made several pronouncements in Sri Lanka which tell us that he views this country through an utterly flawed paradigmatic prism, and therefore cannot but get his perspective on Sri Lanka dangerously wrong.",
    "No member of the Sri Lankan Government that he met talked turkey to T\u00fcrk.",
    "\u2018During the visit, High Commissioner T\u00fcrk called on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and had constructive discussions with Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Vijitha Herath, Minister of Justice and National Integration Harshana Nanayakkara, Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment Arun Hemachandra and Deputy Minister of Defence Major General Aruna Jayasekara.

    "It was a turkey shoot for T\u00fcrk. Starting with the top troika, the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the JVP-NPP Government seems not to have dissented from the High Commissioner\u2019s public pronouncements, and appears to be going along in the main with them.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s citizens should resist the reality of this country\u2019s contemporary history being distorted, an untruthful, inimical narrative being imposed on us by the UN Human Rights High Commissioner, and supinely acceded to by the Anura administration.",
    "Volker Turk\u2019s wild accountability",
    "The visiting UN Human Rights High Commissioner had stated many things that were downright wrong.",
    "\u2018\u2026UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk has pledged support to the Government to build up a domestic accountability mechanism on par with international standards to respond to the needs, aspirations, and expectations of the victims.",
    "T\u00fcrk, wrapping up his four-day visit to Sri Lanka after meeting President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday afternoon, revealed this at a media briefing held at the UN Compound in Colombo before his departure.",
    "\u201cIt is important that domestic accountability mechanisms are functioning and these are part of the discussions we had with the Government. For example, we discussed how to create an independent prosecutor and how to build up a domestic accountability system,\u201d he said.",
    "\u2026The UN Human Rights Chief said that his office had been mandated to get, gather, and preserve information while analysing violations on human rights abuses and had established a dedicated project for the purpose.",
    "\u201cMy office can support future accountability efforts both in Sri Lanka and internationally\u2026\u201d he emphasised.",

    "The fact is that there are no universally accepted or applicable \u2018international standards\u2019 of domestic accountability. Every situation of war results in its own postwar arrangements regarding accountability, which includes, in most cases, not having any accountability process/mechanisms outside the normal institutions and procedures.",

    "By \u2018we\u2019 he means himself and the NPP Government\u2019s leadership. Why an \u2018independent prosecutor\u2019 when the Attorney-General\u2019s Department handles prosecutions? What and who will the independent prosecutor be independent of? Who will he/she be accountable to? Sri Lanka\u2019s Republican Constitution? The sovereign Sri Lankan citizenry? Or an international resolution and an unaccountable, mainly Western-funded and staffed international Office/authority?",
    "Volker T\u00fcrk is on the record as asserting the following on June 24th:",
    "\u201cMany States have experienced years of war, internal armed conflict or repression,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have been able to achieve genuine reconciliation\u2026A steady, unwavering focus on the voices and rights of victims \u2013 and their families \u2013 is essential to this work.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut it is also vital to hold to account the perpetrators of the most severe crimes,\u201d he continued. \u201cVital for justice. Vital for deterrence. Vital for the victims who have suffered inconceivable pain and loss. Vital for the future.\u201d",
    "He shared a personal anecdote as an Austrian, noting how his country only fully confronted its role in Nazi atrocities decades later. \u201cI know that coming to terms with the reality of massacres, terrorism, enforced disappearances, torture or sexual violence is a very painful process,\u201d he said, but stressed the danger of ignoring victims\u2019 suffering or allowing \u201crevisionist narratives\u201d to flourish.",
    "He stressed that justice and acknowledgment of past atrocities were not just matters of history, but essential prerequisites for sustainable peace and development.",
    "\u201cCommissions and inquiries that lead nowhere, or whose recommendations are never implemented, will erode public trust and compound the trauma for victims,\u201d the High Commissioner continued. \u201cI want to emphasise this point: an absence of justice will undermine the stability of peace. Conversely, acknowledging the truth creates the space for justice and reparations \u2013 and ultimately, healing.",
    "\u201cAccountability and justice, including full acknowledgment of the truth of what was done to people, shape the path to lasting reconciliation.\u201d",
    "(https://island.lk/un-rights-chief-asks-govt-to-hold-to-account-perpetrators-of-crimes/)",
    "This is utterly a-historical nonsense. One of the most successful examples of post-conflict peace, stability, reconciliation and development is Northern Ireland/UK. There was no accountability component in the Good Friday agreement. That was not because there were no crimes, even atrocities. Bloody Sunday in Londonderry 1972 is a case in point. To date none of the officers of the British Army\u2019s 1 Para (paratroopers) involved have been punished or even confessed and expressed remorse in a public Truth and Reconciliation process. The silence on accountability in the Good Friday Agreement was because both the Sinn Fein and New Labour knew better than to begin a lacerating process of reopening old wounds.",
    "Another successful democracy, this time a paradigm of transition from dictatorship to democratic rule, is Spain. As I discovered when I served as Ambassador there, not only is there no official inquiry into the half-century of dictatorship, there is a legal ban which has just begun to be softened, on inquiries into crimes committed during the civil war of the 1930s. In Moscow, I met the author of the doctrine of \u2018universal jurisdiction\u2019\u2014which I applaud\u2014Judge Balthazar Garzon, the hero who prosecuted Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was nonetheless prosecuted in Spain because he violated that ban. This is because consolidation of civil peace and durability of civilian democracy are the priorities.",
    "One of the most successful examples in recent history of post-conflict integration and stability is that of Chechnya. After several bouts of civil war, Russia finally crushed the separatist-terrorist militia following heavy bombing of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Today, Grozny is called the Paris of the East and the Chechens are among the most militantly loyal members of the Russian Federation, strongly allied with Moscow and providing detachments of tough fighters for the Ukraine front. There were no special accountability mechanisms for either Russians or Chechens who fought in the bloody civil war. The foundation of success in reconciliation and reintegration was political, not legal. Just BEFORE the victorious final offensive, Moscow held elections to an autonomous Chechen administration. This application of the (Lenin-Stalin derived) formula of regional autonomy was the secret of postwar peace, stability and successful nation-building.",
    "It is the obstructionist Sinhala ultranationalist opposition to the Provincial Council system and the \u2018left-liberal\u2019 JVP-NPP government\u2019s ambivalence towards the 13th amendment, that prevents postwar national reconciliation through democracy, rather than divisive, destabilising accountability mechanisms.",
    "\u2018Nazi atrocities\u2019 and internationalisation",
    "What was the implied relevance to Sri Lanka, of Volker T\u00fcrk\u2019s reference to NAZI atrocities?",
    "He shared a personal anecdote as an Austrian, noting how his country only fully confronted its role in Nazi atrocities decades later. \u201cI know that coming to terms with the reality of massacres, terrorism, enforced disappearances, torture or sexual violence is a very painful process,\u201d he said, but stressed the danger of ignoring victims\u2019 suffering or allowing \u201crevisionist narratives\u201d to flourish.",
    "Nazism was the personification of political evil; of human evil acting in History. What is the relevance of \u2018Nazi atrocities\u2019 have to Sri Lanka?",
    "If there was a Nazi or Nazis in our story it was Velupillai Prabhakaran and his LTTE, whom the Sri Lankan state defeated. Volker T\u00fcrk\u2019s Nazi reference should, if at all, been made in the North. Since it wasn\u2019t, it was wholly gratuitous and the implications nauseatingly deplorable. Even more nauseating is that the NPP Govt\u2019s leaders didn\u2019t utter a single word of objection about it.",
    "Volker T\u00fcrk\u2019s attempt at internationalisation must be rejected.",
    "\u2018Despite Sri Lanka government\u2019s assertion of local mechanism to address the past human rights abuses, the visiting United Nations Human Rights high commissioner Volker T\u00fcrk insisted that the international mechanism is vital for confidence building of the victims\u2026\u2019",
    "(https://economynext.com/un-rights-chief-insists-on-international-mechanism-for-past-rights-abuses-227472/)",
    "His \u2018internationalisation\u2019 project was clearly confirmed by the Sunday Times:",
    "\u2018\u2026Even though governments have changed and whatever promises are made of setting up a credible domestic process, Mr. T\u00fcrk explained that the reason that an international component is needed for the investigation is because Sri Lanka has struggled to move forward with domestic accountability mechanisms that are credible and have the trust and confidence of victims. \u201cThis is why Sri Lankans have looked outside for justice through assistance at the international level. Ultimately it is the state\u2019s responsibility, and it is important that this process is nationally owned\u2014and it can be complemented and supported by international means. My own office has been mandated to gather and preserve information and analyse violations and abuses and has established a dedicated project for this purpose. I hope that it can support future accountability efforts, both here in Sri Lanka and internationally,\u201d he said.\u2019",
    "(https://www.sundaytimes.lk/250629/columns/beyond-niceties-un-bonhomie-wont-end-lankas-human-rights-woes-602779.html)",
    "There is a serious, four-fold problem here.",
    "The NPP Government has no mandate to implement any domestic accountability process with an \u201cinternational mechanism\u201d or \u201cinternational component\u201d.",
    "The \u201cinternational component\u201d and a nationally-owned process \u201ccomplemented and supported by international means\u201d have not been specified.",
    "Such an international \u201ccomponent\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cmeans\u201d could transgress the Sri Lankan Constitution.",
    "The hypocrisy is shocking. Did anyone ask the UN Human Rights Chief whether his Office has been \u201cmandated to get, gather and preserve information while analysing violations on human rights abuses and had established a dedicated project for the purpose\u2026and can support future accountability efforts internationally\u201d with regard to Israeli IDF officers responsible for the ongoing, televised, genocide in Gaza? If not, why should Sri Lanka cooperate with any such mechanism in the case of a legitimate war of self-defence and territorial reunification within our own internationally recognised borders?",
    "Even if Trump\u2019s USA no longer funds \u2018war crimes inquiries\u2019, the G7 states with an influential Tamil Diaspora vote-bloc will pick up the slack\u2014Canada and the UK come to mind, backed by many EU members. These states, masters of hypocrisy, will not fund an OHCHR inquiry into or comprehensive data-base of genocidal Israeli war-crimes and genocidaire IDF commanders, officers and Ministers.",
    "CBK: Destiny discarded",
    "Wartime Sri Lanka was dominated by the triangle of three political personalities born into the postwar world: Chandrika Bandaranaike (1945), Mahinda Rajapaksa (1945), Ranil Wickremesinghe (1949).",
    "Chandrika and Ranil were each born with a silver spoon in the mouth, unlike the rough diamond from the Deep South. Yet Ranil was never popularly elected the country\u2019s leader even after serving as unelected President (2022-2024).",
    "Chandrika\u2019s elected predecessor Ranasinghe Premadasa broke a caste-class \u2018glass ceiling\u2019, defeated the barbaric JVP uprising that slaughtered her husband Vijaya Kumaratunga, sent back 70,000 foreign troops from Sri Lanka thereby restoring the country\u2019s independence and sovereignty, and launched a 200 garment factories program of rapid, export-led provincial industrialisation which still keeps us afloat.",
    "Chandrika\u2019s elected successor Mahinda Rajapaksa ended a 30-year separatist war that five previous leaders had failed to, defeating Prabhakaran who had assassinated the legendary Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s grandson and former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on India\u2019s soil. Had Prabhakaran won, he\u2019d have attempted to attract Tamil Nadu away from India and establish a Greater Tamil Eelam.",
    "What, by comparison, was Chandrika\u2019s historic achievement?",
    "Chandrika squandered her political capital on a wild-goose chase for a quasi-federal/post-unitary Constitutional \u2018package\u2019 (1995-1997), ignoring two achievable targets: the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact (1957) which her father was thwarted from implementing but she as President could have, and Provincial devolution (1987), the advocacy of which cost her charismatic leftwing husband Vijaya Kumaratunga his life at the JVP\u2019s hands.",
    "Even after Prabhakaran unilaterally restarted the war in 1995, Chandrika continued the Sudu Nelum \u2018antiwar\u2019 campaign which severely, counterproductively constricted recruitment to the Sri Lankan military while Prabhakaran\u2019s forced conscription continued unabated.",
    "CBK\u2019s finest hours were 1995 when she liberated Jaffna from Prabhakaran, and 2000, when she stopped the LTTE\u2019s advance on Jaffna as well as the Sri Lankan army\u2019s planned evacuation from the city. After her brush with a suicide-bombing LTTE assassin who blinded her (1999), CBK could have easily secured support from China, India and Pakistan as her successor Mahinda did, and won the war with the political will, determination and global outreach her mother always displayed.",
    "But CBK never committed to defeating Prabhakaran, only to bringing him --yet again-- to the negotiating table. If she had consulted JN Dixit, Nirupam Sen, Hardeep Puri and Dr Jaishankar, all of whom she knew well, they would have told her that no negotiated settlement was possible with Prabhakaran, because they\u2019d tried and he had double-crossed India just as he did Premadasa later.",
    "Had Chandrika consulted her friends the leaders of the Tamil Eelam left (PLOT, EPRLF), they\u2019d have pointed to the trail of bodies-- Sri Sabaratnam, Rajani Tiranagama, Amirthalingam, Yogeswaran, K. Padmanabha, Sam Tambimuttu, Neelan Tiruchelvam-- and emphasised the same thing.",
    "Ignoring the objections of our finest foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, and heeding her considerably less patriotic and principled new advisors instead, Chandrika chose to bet on the PTOMS with Prabhakaran, Ranil\u2019s victory over Mahinda (2005), and a federal future.",
    "With two Prime Ministers as parents, an unprecedented and unsurpassed 61% vote (1994), and a second term (1999), no Lankan leader had a better chance at a history-making destiny than CBK. None frittered it away with as much irresponsible insouciance as she did. For their consistent, principled patriotism, Chandrika\u2019s parents will be remembered more indelibly and respectfully.",
