Factual information presented in the article:

- The article discusses the views of Dr. H.N. Thenuwara, former Assistant Governor of the Central Bank and current Adjunct Professor at the University of Iowa.
- Dr. Thenuwara has recently unveiled the content of his forthcoming book titled ‘Economic Growth, Development, Stability, and the Government in Sri Lanka’, which critically examines the current state of Sri Lanka's economy.
- In his book, Thenuwara focuses on the topic of Sri Lanka missing all the past four industrial revolutions and potentially missing the upcoming fifth revolution if suitable policies aren't adopted.
- Sri Lanka missed the first and second industrial revolutions due to colonial rule and because of the non-availability of required electrical power for setting up industrial plants.

- In the chapter about prospects of economic recovery, Thenuwara uses East Asian countries as examples of economic turnarounds.

Opinions expressed in the article:

- The writer opines that for countries to both facilitate an industrial revolution and experience economic growth, they must provide opportunities for their population to acquire essential skills and knowledge. 
- Thenuwara makes the subjective assertion that Sri Lanka will likely miss the fifth industrial revolution unless it implements appropriate gestational policies.
- Thenuwara is critical of Sri Lanka's past economic policy choices, attributing the country's failures to join industrial revolutions to oppressive colonial policies and extensive government corruption.
- The author views Wickremesinghe's plans to import the fourth industrial revolution through improved trade and investment relationships as unsustainable, and criticizes the subsequent failure of other political leaders to properly consider alignment with this revolution.
- Thenuwara suggests a pragmatic approach, rejecting clinging to any specific economic ideology, and advocates for increased countrywide transparency to discourage corruption and promote economic growth.
- Finally, the writer lauds Thenuwara's book as a valuable read for those interested and invested in Sri Lanka's economy.
