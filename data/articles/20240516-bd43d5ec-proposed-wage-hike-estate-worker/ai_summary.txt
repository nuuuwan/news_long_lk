Estate workers in Sri Lanka endure harsh conditions, such as leech bites, unpredictable weather, and unsafe environments, to earn their livelihoods. Recently, the Labour Commissioner issued a gazette for a 70% wage increase, raising workers' pay to Rs. 1750. Despite the physically demanding work, many workers, like Nallusamy Seethaletchami, still struggle with their wages, often resorting to loans to cover essential expenses such as children's education. Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) and estate employers oppose the wage increase. Advocate groups argue that current wages are insufficient, exacerbating workers' hardships and economic instability.

The Planters Association of Ceylon has expressed intentions to contest the wage increase proposals, arguing the financial burden on companies. Meanwhile, tea smallholders have been impacted by previous government policies and contend that their production costs often surpass profits. Some propose improving productivity through mechanization as a solution.

Historically, wage hikes have been slow, taking 14 years for previous increments. Despite new proposals, the underlying economic crisis and ongoing exploitation persist, with experts suggesting that workers need a minimum of Rs. 2000 to survive the current economic climate. An alternative model, inspired by tea smallholders, involves leasing lands to workers for additional income.

Moreover, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised infrastructure improvements and plans to upgrade line rooms into villages to offer better living conditions for estate workers. The Ceylon Workers Congress continues to advocate for the rights of the plantation community, implementing programs to enhance housing and land ownership for workers.
