President Ranil Wickreme-singhe has challenged Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa to disclose the source of funding for the party’s ongoing school bus donation program.

Addressing another public meeting in Kandy under the “Ekwa Jayagamu” (Let’s Win Together) series of rallies over the weekend, President Ranil Wickremesinghe set a condition for joining the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa.

The President said he is ready to collaborate with the SJB to combat corruption, but only if Premadasa discloses the source of funding for the school bus donation program.

He recalled that Harris Leuke Ratwatte was a founding member of the United National Party (UNP) and expressed regret that State Minister Lohan Ratwatte did not follow in his footsteps. “However, Lohan and I are on the same platform today.

That is because we have the strength to save this country, and we love our motherland,” he said.

Commenting on the actions needed when the country faces troubles, Wickremesinghe recalled that in 1953, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, along with Dudley Senanayake, went to India to sign an agreement granting citizenship to Tamils in the estate communities.

Similarly, he mentioned that in 1971, former President J.R. Jayawardene expressed his support to Sirimavo Bandaranaike to suppress the insurrection at that time.

“That is how the UNP has trained us. We always work with the country’s best interests in mind. If we are asked to take power, we have been told by J.R. to take it up. If someone is not willing to take power when offered, he isn’t a true UNPer. Our primary duty is to protect this country,” he said.

The President said that he assumed leadership of the country during a challenging period, drawing confidence from his experience with leaders like J.R. Jayawardene and R. Premadasa.

“The SLPP supported me. No matter how many good ideas I have, I cannot work alone. When the SLPP split, some followed the ‘Groom of the Stool’ while others remained loyal to the King. Now they claim the King is not good, but the Groom of the Stool is. That cannot be,” he said.

He clarified that he has no intention of protecting the Rajapaksa clan and has only ever safeguarded R. Premadasa from political attacks.

Reiterating his call for unity among former UNP members, he declared, “I have now saved the country.”

The President also added that if Premadasa supports his efforts to save Sri Lanka, he will reinstate Premadasa’s UNP membership, which was previously revoked. “Let us all embark on this journey together,” he said.

The President also announced that talks have concluded to establish Hilton and Taj hotels in Kandy, along with a total of five new hotels. He mentioned that the Government will invite Japan to assist in expanding Kandy town to Kundasale. Additionally, a Climate Change University will be set up in Kotmale.
