Facts presented:
- Raj Uncle, who never left the North as he considered it his birthplace despite hardships, claims that the majority of Tamil people voted against the Rajapaksas in the last few Presidential elections.
- Raj Uncle anticipates that the Tamil people won't vote for Sajith, and will instead significantly tilt towards a Tamil presidential candidate, specifically Gajendrakumar Ponambalam, as they're disappointed with Sajith's performance concerning Tamil people's issues.
- The United National Party (UNP) didn't succeed anywhere in the last parliamentary elections but managed to secure a 'bonus' seat which went to Ranil Wickremesinghe, who subsequently became Prime Minister and President.
- Lauket Aly argues that the UNP currently has the backing and parliamentary support of the Rajapaksa family party, the Pohottuwa, also known as the SLPP.

Opinions expressed:
- Raj Uncle believes that AKD will form the next government, and under his rule, the Tamil folk could lead a more peaceful life.
- Lauket Aly disagrees with Raj Uncle's prediction, stating that itâ€™s too simplistic. He believes AKD needs every vote possible, including from the former conflict areas.
- Aly argues that urging Tamil citizens to vote exclusively for a Tamil candidate is almost a breach of duty and could be seen as a waste of democratic process. He sees a straight run for either Sajith or AKD.
- He suggests that for Ranna to succeed as the President, he must distance himself from the Rajapaksa clan and gain support from the SJB.
- Aly advocates for AKD to be the focal point of the next election, expressing hope that he'll address corruption and the economy if he becomes President, risking being voted out if he doesn't deliver.
