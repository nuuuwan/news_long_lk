Preserving our history is not a task to be left to chance, as the consequences of neglect could lead to its permanent loss. Preservation is not only about protecting artefacts or documents—it is about honouring the truth and ensuring that the lessons of the past remain accessible for future generations to learn from. Only by committing to this endeavour with seriousness and purpose can Sri Lanka hope to retain and share its rich and multifaceted legacy with the world

Historical fiction writers possess vivid imaginations, which breathe life into their stories, making them far more captivating than the often dry pages of history books. However, while their creative minds soar with boundless ideas, they are tethered by the anchor of facts, ensuring their narratives remain rooted to the ground.

For Diana Chambers, internationally renowned historical fiction author, Julia Child—a beloved figure from a bygone era—became a fascinating subject and the central character in her novel, ‘The Secret War of Julia Child.’ A book that took the literary world by storm, becoming a USA Today national bestseller and named one of the best historical fiction novels of 2024 by the Washington Post.

Most people associate Julia Child with French cuisine and her iconic cooking lessons. To contemporary audiences, her life may bring back memories of Meryl Streep’s portrayal in the Hollywood movie Julie & Julia. But Chambers dives much deeper, uncovering a surprising chapter of Julia’s life: her connection to espionage during World War II. Even more intriguing for Sri Lankans is that Julia Child spent time in wartime Ceylon during this period.

Chambers devoted nearly a decade to researching and writing this compelling piece of historical fiction, placing Child at the heart of her narrative. Yet, as the author admits, Julia Child served as a “hook” to tell a broader story—a lens through which she could explore a forgotten and shadowy aspect of World War II in Asia.

Uncovering tangible historical markers

In 2016, Chambers visited Sri Lanka to deepen her research. Her trip was not merely to add local colour or ambiance to her story but to uncover tangible historical markers that would lend authenticity to her novel. In Colombo, she found remnants of the World War II era, such as the iconic Galle Face Hotel, while in Kandy, she visited the Queen’s Hotel and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya, locations steeped in wartime history. Her island-wide research also led to two critical scenes that took place in the Dambulla Caves and Polonnaruwa, as well as another in Trincomalee. But in Peradeniya, her quest was not without disappointment. As this important setting was documented in historical records, Diana was on a mission to find remnants of Britain’s South East Asia Command, which had been based there.

Interviews with the staff and people who might remember the period led her to conclude that the SEAC headquarters were located in and around the former Herbarium library. However she found no plaque or physical evidence. Nor could she find evidence of the US Office of Strategic Services, OSS, which had been housed in a tea plantation donated by a local planter. “Presumably this has returned to its agricultural status or been redeveloped for other purposes. As this was a secret base, it was no surprise that no physical markers remained,” Chambers says. Much of the evidence she sought of Ceylon’s role in the war, had either vanished or had been inaccessible.

Why is World War II so vital to Sri Lanka’s story?

This highlights a broader issue—Sri Lanka’s lack of recognition for the power of preserving modern day history and archives. The value of crafting and promoting narratives through its records is something this country is yet to practice properly. The gap in historical preservation and storytelling raises a crucial question. Why is World War II so vital to Sri Lanka’s story, and why should it matter to us today?

To understand this, we must revisit the pivotal events of 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, through 5 April 1942—a period when the Japanese forces turned their sights on the Indian Ocean, with Ceylon as a primary target. This timeline includes significant moments, such as the Japanese air raid on Colombo and Trincomalee, which were intended to cripple the Allied forces’ control in the region which everyone on the island thought to be the forerunner to invasion. These events marked a turning point in the war and highlighted the island’s strategic importance. But although there is a great deal of information to be found on the South East Asian war, little remains about the South Asian war.

Despite its historical significance, this chapter of Sri Lanka’s WWII story remains obscure. Apart from a handful of references—such as Michael Tomlinson’s “The Most Dangerous Moment: The Japanese Assault on Ceylon” and another recent publication—World War II in Ceylon is a largely forgotten narrative. Even on the internet, detailed accounts of these critical events are negligible.

This neglect, apart from being a disservice to history is a missed opportunity. Properly documented and shared, these stories could shape how the world perceives Sri Lanka, attracting attention not only to its cultural and natural beauty but also to the pivotal role it played in global events. Chambers’ novel, by intertwining espionage, history, and an icon like Julia Child, demonstrates the powerful storytelling potential Sri Lanka’s untold history holds.

Preserving and promoting these narratives is more than an academic exercise; it’s about creating a sense of pride, fostering cultural tourism, and building Sri Lanka’s soft power on the world stage. From war-torn landmarks to hidden tales of bravery and espionage, these stories have the potential to captivate the imaginations of audiences worldwide. The question is, will Sri Lanka seize this opportunity to tell its story, or will it let its history fade into obscurity?

Treasure trove of stories waiting to be told

Diana Chambers’ journey to uncover forgotten places and weave them into her fiction is a reminder of what is possible when history meets creativity. It’s time for Sri Lanka to recognise the treasure trove of stories waiting to be told and to share them with the world. When it comes to crafting fictional stories, one of the first questions we ask is whether they are plot-driven or character-driven. Do the events shape the narrative, or do the characters’ choices and evolution take centre stage? However, there is yet another critical element that can elevate a story to new heights, one that writers like Diana Chambers masterfully weave into their work: location and local ambiance.

For Chambers, the setting is more than a backdrop—it becomes a living, breathing character in its own right. By grounding her stories in carefully chosen locations, she creates a sensory experience for readers, drawing them into a world that feels authentic and alive. This requires more than imagination; it calls for firsthand experience. These writers visit places to immerse themselves in the environment, walking the streets, observing the architecture, and soaking in the local atmosphere.

When these settings are rich in history and well-preserved, they offer more than a sense of place—they reveal hidden secrets of the past. Antiquated buildings, forgotten alleyways, and lingering echoes of bygone eras whisper stories that inspire fiction writers. The elements ignite imagination, allowing authors to weave tales filled with romance, intrigue, and passion.

Diana Chambers exemplifies this approach in her historical fiction. She doesn’t just use a location as a static stage; she unearths its layers of history and culture, crafting narratives that resonate deeply. For her novel ‘The Secret War of Julia Child’, Chambers explored Sri Lanka’s wartime history, seeking out little scraps of World War II to ground her story.

In a world where readers crave authenticity and connection, the ability to harness the power of place is invaluable. Diana Chambers and writers like her remind us that fiction is not just about people and events; it’s about the world they inhabit. When that world is meticulously crafted and vividly rendered, it becomes an essential part of the story, drawing readers into an exciting journey.

Separate genre in the literary and film industry

World War II stories are hugely important because they are a separate genre in the literary and film industry. Let’s ask ourselves what iconic story with international appeal has ever emerged out of Sri Lanka? Some would like to say the ‘Bridge on the River Kwai’, but that was just filmed on the island. It was not a Sri Lankan story!

While we boast of numerous historical accounts of battles, of palace intrigue and a fortress built on a rock, these stories are centuries old. It is the more recent history that often goes unattended and neglected. Writing ancient history is a case of connecting the dots and the more ancient the stories are there is a lot of guesswork going on, which is not the case when writing more recent history. It is quite the opposite, because in the 20th century, there were a whole bunch of people documenting events, newspapers, record keepers in state run organisations, minutes of meetings held by the private sector, authors, etc. However here in Sri Lanka archival records of more recent history are carelessly stored, and significant gaps exist in even the most basic historical sources, such as newspapers from the mid-20th century. This lack of preservation threatens to erase critical narratives that connect our past to the modern world.

World War II, for instance, was a pivotal moment in global history. It served as a bridge between the old colonial world and the new geopolitical order we live in today. The war reshaped nations, alliances, and economies, and its lessons are crucial for understanding our current global structure. Sri Lanka, or Ceylon as it was then known, played a significant role during this period, particularly as a strategic base in the Indian Ocean. Yet, if we fail to properly document and position this chapter of history, much will be lost—both in terms of knowledge and in opportunities to present our historical relevance to the world.

How fiction can create an alternate narrative

Diana Chambers’ novel, ‘The Secret War of Julia Child’, offers a compelling example of how fiction can create an alternate narrative. Set in 1944 Ceylon, the book not only brings to life a forgotten period of our history but also draws global attention to it. Chambers visited Sri Lanka last week to participate in the HSBC Ceylon Literary and Arts Festival held at the Colombo Public Library. Her interactions with readers and literary enthusiasts was the icing on the cake for that event! Her novel flew off the shelves at the festival bookstore, a testament to the hunger for engaging stories rooted in our history. Chambers also shared insights during her session on the making of the book, revealing how meticulous research and a deep connection to the setting shaped her narrative.

The success of ‘The Secret War of Julia Child’ illustrates the potential of storytelling to preserve and amplify Sri Lanka’s modern history. It invites readers to not only learn about historical events but to experience them through the lens of characters and emotions. The book is a reminder for Sri Lanka to prioritise preserving its modern history. Whether through better archival practices, more robust documentation of historical events, showcasing creative works like Chambers’, or preserving monuments and historical documents, it is essential to safeguard our narratives.

If Sri Lanka can harness this potential, it will not only protect its legacy but also create a strong foundation for future generations to explore and understand their heritage. This effort cannot be approached with a lackadaisical attitude; it must be enshrined in government policy. Preserving our history is not a task to be left to chance, as the consequences of neglect could lead to its permanent loss. Preservation is not only about protecting artefacts or documents—it is about honouring the truth and ensuring that the lessons of the past remain accessible for future generations to learn from. Only by committing to this endeavour with seriousness and purpose can Sri Lanka hope to retain and share its rich and multifaceted legacy with the world.

Diana Chambers has helped in her own way! She says, “I wanted to bring the “Forgotten War in Asia” to the West’s attention and recognise the achievements and sacrifices of the struggling peoples throughout the region to the fight for freedom—which led directly to independence for India and Ceylon.”
