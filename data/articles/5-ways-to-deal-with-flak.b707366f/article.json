    "When a coworker isn\u2019t pulling their weight \u2014 or is flat-out unreliable \u2014 it can feel frustrating and like you\u2019re not in control. But even though it isn\u2019t ideal, there are ways to work around an unreliable colleague and protect yourself by focusing on what you can control and letting go of what you can\u2019t. Early-career employees in this position can try five tips: Document your work; ask how can you leverage this person\u2019s strengths; don\u2019t complain or gossip, but enlist help; ask what you can learn; and review past experiences to find a way forward.",
    "Have you ever done a group project where other members didn\u2019t do their part? When you\u2019re starting your career and get the role you\u2019ve been wishing for, it\u2019s exciting. Yet you may find yourself in a familiar, troubling dynamic when a coworker doesn\u2019t pull their weight. This can leave you feeling frustrated, not in control, and unable to get the work done.",
