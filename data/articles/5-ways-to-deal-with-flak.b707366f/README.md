When a coworker isn’t pulling their weight — or is flat-out unreliable — it can feel frustrating and like you’re not in control. But even though it isn’t ideal, there are ways to work around an unreliable colleague and protect yourself by focusing on what you can control and letting go of what you can’t. Early-career employees in this position can try five tips: Document your work; ask how can you leverage this person’s strengths; don’t complain or gossip, but enlist help; ask what you can learn; and review past experiences to find a way forward.

Have you ever done a group project where other members didn’t do their part? When you’re starting your career and get the role you’ve been wishing for, it’s exciting. Yet you may find yourself in a familiar, troubling dynamic when a coworker doesn’t pull their weight. This can leave you feeling frustrated, not in control, and unable to get the work done.
