1️⃣ A democratic government restoration agenda from the Collective for Democracy calls for major changes in Sri Lanka's constitution and governance. Proposed changes aim to restore parliamentary democracy and replace the 1978 Constitution.🏛️

2️⃣ Key principles include restoring public trust, creating mechanisms for accountability, preventing misuse of power, and encouraging citizen participation in governance.💼🗳️

3️⃣ The proposals suggest the official name of the country be 'Sri Lanka' instead of the 'Democratic, Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.' Sovereignty would remain with the Sri Lankan people, with citizens considered free and equal.✍️

4️⃣ New Constitutional Principles and Values would be outlined in the Constitution, ensuring social, economic, and ethnic equality, constitutional supremacy, and transparent governance.💡⚖️

5️⃣ The new Constitution would allow a shift of political power from the Executive President to the Parliament, ensuring the abolition of the executive presidential system leads to restored parliamentary democracy.📝

6️⃣ A Second Chamber, or Senate, would be created. This would enhance representation and ensure closer relations between different government levels. This structure would comprise 200 House of Representatives members, elected from different levels.🏦

7️⃣ If the newly appointed Prime Minister doesn't win a vote of confidence at the first sitting, they will resign. Repeated failures to win confidence would result in the dissolution of the House of Representatives.🔄

8️⃣ Public trust in Parliament and Members would be restored by correcting existing practices related to MPs crossing parties. The right for voters to recall an MP violating their mandate is proposed for further exploration.👥

9️⃣ A 50 member Senate would represent different communities and create a mechanism for power-sharing. All Bills would be referred to the Senate before a Second Reading, serving as a democratic check and balance.🔁

🔟 The 'Executive Presidential' system of government would be abolished. The President would become the nominal head of State, elected by an electoral college. This change aims to diversify political office representation between ethnic communities.🌎
