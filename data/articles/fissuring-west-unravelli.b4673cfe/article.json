    "\u201cGambling with World War 3\u201d?",
    "Conservative \u2018Christian Nationalist\u2019 or retro-Soviet Neo-Stalinist?",
    "\u201cLook, the world is being turned upside down!\u201d",
    "\u2013 Mao Zedong (\u2018Two Birds: A Dialogue\u2019)",
    "Ukraine has caused a schism in the West, but why and what about? There are two fissures in the West, firstly at the interstate level, between European states and the USA; secondly, interactive with the first, within Western society, chiefly American society.",
    "The schism was triggered by the Zelensky-Vance exchange which became a Zelensky-Trump spat in the White House, and the UK-EU reaction to it. The backdrop was Zelensky\u2019s February speech at the Munich Security Conference which raised the banner of Europe uniting against Russia despite possible US moves at a negotiated peace. Zelensky\u2019s strident Munich oration came in the wake of Keir Starmer\u2019s attempt to \u2018Trump-proof\u2019 the Ukraine war by signing an absurdly titled \u2018Hundred Year Treaty\u2019 with Kiev.",
    "All this was without consulting the incoming US administration on what its policy and plans might be and giving it any space and time. It was a pre-emptive strike by the UK-Ukraine-EU.",
    "The pause in US military supplies and freeze in intelligence flows to US-made long-range Ukrainian rocketry targeting Russia was Washington\u2019s instant response to UK-led European hawkishness instead of cooling-down diplomacy at Lancaster House (London) immediately following the White House incident.",
    "The chain of events clarifies the core issue: who leads the West? Is it the US or Europe? Is it the US, or the UK+Europe? Does Europe follow the US or UK? Does Britain follow US leadership or does it aspire to lead Europe?",
    "The sheriff leads the posse. The posse follows the sheriff in the direction the sheriff leads, after the bandit the sheriff is chasing. But now, the (European) posse, lobbied by an aspirant deputy sheriff (UK) wants the sheriff to lead in the direction it wishes, against the bandit it wishes to lynch.",
    "How can US leadership of the \u2018Free World\u2019, let alone the world as such, be credible, if it doesn\u2019t lead the West but allows itself to be led by the nose by the UK-EU instead?",
    "No wonder Jeremy Corbyn was framed and ousted from the Labour leadership chiefly by Keir Starmer.",
    "The British played a disruptive role in the Ukraine conflict since Prime Minister Boris Johnson flew in and almost certainly stopped Zelensky from agreeing to a peace deal with Russia in April 2022.",
    "While welcoming Zelensky at No 10 Downing Street after the White House episode, and later at Lancaster House, Keir Starmer tried to slip the UK into a leadership role in Europe and a co-leadership role with the US in the West. In Brussels, the EU solidified around Zelensky, taking Munich and London to the next level.",
    "The UK has played a provocative role in the post-Cold War world with the \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019 (WMD) lie originating with a British intelligence asset and insistently shared by Prime Minister Tony Blair with President George W Bush, catalysing the disastrous Iraq War of 2003 which destroyed states, uncorked the Islamist militias and continues to destabilize the region.",
    "This falls within the British tradition. In the closing stages of WWII, Churchill flew to meet Stalin without consulting or informing Washington, and literally penciled on the back of an envelope, a sharing-out of postwar Europe in which the USSR (understandably) had overwhelming preponderance in Eastern Europe. One year after WWII, the same Churchill, this time out of office, flew to the US and delivered his famous speech in Fulton Missouri, declaring that \u2018an iron curtain\u2019 had fallen across Europe, i.e., over the Eastern part that he had offered Stalin and had been accepted by the latter. While it wouldn\u2019t have worked with Roosevelt, it did with Truman. The Cold War commenced, wrecking the peacetime potentials of the wartime anti-fascist alliance (USA-USSR-UK-France) and the establishment of the United Nations.",
    "All this is part of Britain\u2019s ceaseless attempt to stay relevant at whatever cost to the world, having lost its Empire and been supplanted by the US.",
    "Trump intends to underscore the leading role of the US, meaning the superpower that pays the piper calls the tune; provides most of the hardware draws the parameters, has the veto-- and not the other way around. But the UK assumes that Trump will last only four years, if he isn\u2019t impeached before that, and that the risk is worth it because it gives Britain, which exited the EU, a chance to lead Europe.",
    "President Macron is partnering the UK, advertising possibilities of unfurling France\u2019s nuclear umbrella over Europe (however defined) because it raises his and France\u2019s profile. He has ignored the firm opinion of France\u2019s greatest modern leader, President Charles de Gaulle, that European unity is best without the UK, should be continental.",
    "The European decision to enter a new \u2018Age of Rearmament\u2019 (Ursula Von de Leyen) will divert resources from much needed domestic concerns and cause a surge of support for parties outside the liberal-conservative mainstream\u2014radical rightwing populist-ultranationalists (e.g., Germany\u2019s AfD), or the Left (e.g., Germany\u2019s Die Linke which impressively increased its vote).",
    "The USA as a global superpower has to take a \u2018grand strategic\u2019 perspective, while the UK-EU can\u2019t quite see beyond the continent.",
    "The Trump team is trying to do a \u2018Nixon-Kissinger redux\u2019. Kissinger sought to extricate the US from a losing war in Vietnam by coopting or neutralising the two great powers that were supporting North Vietnam\u2014Russia and China. There was a policy of d\u00e9tente toward the USSR and a dramatic opening to Mao\u2019s China. After America\u2019s diplomacy and military might failed to deny the Vietnamese a military victory, Kissinger and his successor under (Democrat) Jimmy Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski, coopted China as quasi-ally against the USSR.",
    "Though the intention was utterly imperialistic and reactionary\u2014to prevent the victory of Vietnam\u2019s struggle of national liberation and reunification\u2014no reasonable person anywhere thought the breakthrough in US relations with Russia (symbolised by SALT I) was bad. It was applauded because it reduced the risk of nuclear war, long recognised as humanity\u2019s primary existential threat. Similarly, no one of rational views was unhappy that the US finally recognised the glaring reality that the UN Security Council seat belonged to the People\u2019s Republic of China, the world\u2019s most populous nation, rather than to the regime in Taiwan.",
    "Today\u2019s post-modern West is unrecognisably different. US Democrats, UK governments both Conservative and Labour, and most European governments, do not view a rapprochement between the US and Russia, the world\u2019s two nuclear superpowers, as positive, but rather as appeasement, even treason.",
    "They want to escalate the war so as to put Ukraine in a position of strength in any negotiation, and are willing to put boots on the ground. They ignore the revision of Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine which lowers the threshold and lays a new tripwire: a threat to the Russian state evaluated as existential, even from conventional forces and weapons, could, if it involved nuclear powers (e.g. UK, France), warrant the use by Russia of nuclear weapons (presumably low-yield tac-nukes). The \u2018new sheriff in town\u2019 in Washington DC wasn\u2019t being melodramatic for once, when he accused Zelensky of \u201cgambling with World War III\u201d.",
    "European leaders sneer at Trump\u2019s attempt to prise space between Russia and China, saying Russia is in too deep. If they\u2019re right, it\u2019s mostly because of European obduracy. Russia\u2019s primary unit of strategic analysis is the Eurasian landmass. So long as Russia feels threatened on its Western flank from which it was invaded by Napoleonic France, and Germany in both World Wars, it will maintain a close \u2018back-to-back\u2019 partnership with China to its East.",
    "Two more reasons feed into Trump\u2019s efforts at rapprochement with Russia. Washington hopes to delink Russia from Iran. Republican policymakers agree with Samuel Huntington\u2019s thesis of the Clash of Civilizations in which a supposed Sinic-Persian (Sino-Iranian) axis will be America\u2019s main challenger. Russia-China-Iran have joint naval exercises scheduled.",
    "The third reason is religious ideology: the rise of the Christian Right or \u2018Christian nationalism\u2019. For the Christian-Zionist right, integral to Trump\u2019s MAGA base, Putin\u2019s Russia is not the neo-Soviet, quasi-Stalinist ogre that UK-EU see or depict. It is a fellow conservative Christian-nationalist power like Hungary, but a huge, nuclear superpower. Trump\u2019s base sees no reason to go to war, or hemorrhage dollars helping anyone wage war, against an ideological brother-in-arms in a common \u2018Culture War\u2019 against gender-proliferating liberal decadence.",
    "Ukraine and Yugoslavia",
    "The proclamation that Europe cannot countenance the violation of national independence and sovereignty of a fellow European state, evokes bitter laughter from my generation in the global South, because Europe, together with the USA\u2014NATO\u2014dismembered and ended, eradicated, an existing country which was a close friend of Sri Lanka and the Global South: Yugoslavia.",
    "Starting with Germany, Europe recognised the secessionist republics. Unlike Desert Storm which rolled back Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, here the West intervened in an internal conflict\u2014against Serbia, the main constituent state, in two civil wars (Bosnia, Kosovo). NATO bombed the capital Belgrade (where the Nonaligned Movement was founded in 1961, with Sirimavo Bandaranaike attending) and blasted Yugoslavia into oblivion as a country. The West followed up with a dispensation which violated a UN Security Council Resolution recognising Kosovo as a province of Serbia, and steered Kosovo into a separate country.",
    "Clinton and Blair, neoliberal Democrat and New Labour, led the charge. This was the prototype for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by Republican neoconservative George W Bush.",
    "NATO eviscerated a European country when Russia was at its most benignly cooperative with the West under the supine leadership of Boris Yeltsin. The choice of Putin as Yeltsin\u2019s successor at end-1999 was in the context of Moscow\u2019s bitter recognition of the real nature of the West, which rode roughshod over Russia\u2019s sentiments of Slavic solidarity with Serbia and Serbs. The trauma of NATO\u2019s destruction of Yugoslavia was a factor in Russia\u2019s military intervention in Crimea and Donbass, intended to save the Russian-speaking populations from the same fate as Bosnia\u2019s and Kosovo\u2019s Serbs.",
    "UK-EU reflexes towards Russia on Ukraine are rooted in the European power-struggles of centuries against Tsarist Russia, e.g. the Great Game, the Crimean wars, Polish and Baltic nationalisms. UK-EU want Washington to abandon a global \u2018grand strategy\u2019 and peer through their prism of continental geopolitics and parochial \u2018historicism\u2019.",
    "West\u2019s intellectual decline",
    "Two famous names have disappeared from televised high-level remarks and policy discussions though they constitute essential reference points: George Kennan and Henry Kissinger, the most outstanding US/Western strategic thinkers of the post-WWII period.",
    "After the Cold War, the West no longer respected \u2018spheres of influence\u2019, overrode the warnings of the father of \u2018Containment\u2019 George Kennan (whom UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called \u2018George Keenan\u2019 at Munich\u2019s roundtable/open forum with US General Kellogg) and pushed the borders of the West eastwards, enlarging NATO formally or informally.",
    "\u201cExpanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking \u2026\u201d (George F. Kennan, \u2018A Fateful Error\u2019, New York Times, Feb 5th 1997)",
    "This was over two years before Putin became president.",
    "For his part, Henry Kissinger argued up to his death in 2023 that:",
    "Neither Russia, nor Ukraine plus the West, will be able to win the war.",
    "Ukraine will be unable to retain or retrieve most of the Russian-speaking areas (Crimea, Donbass).",
    "Russia will be unable to take and hold all of them, still less move beyond them.",
    "The continuation of the war draws Russia and China closer while riskily damaging the relationship between the two main nuclear powers, the USA and Russia.",
    "Partition and spheres of influence comprise the only realistic solution.",
    "On Ukraine/Russia, the Trump administration\u2019s thinking corresponds to Kissingerian realism.",
    "Sadly, the Trump team ignores Kissinger on China. In his last years Kissinger wanted the tripolar/trilateral \u2018great power\u2019 arch of USA-China-Russia repaired and rebuilt, to reinforce the architecture of a shaky world order.",
    "Lenin would recognise the \u2018inter-imperialist split\u2019; Mao, the emergence of UK-EU as a \u2018new imperialist power-centre\u2019. The horizontal (interstate) and vertical (intrastate-ideological) splits in the West manifest a multidimensional crisis.",
    "Crisis of the neoliberal-globalist economic model: Biden responded with post-neoliberal policies which proved inadequate mainly because of the colossal drain of resources on Israel and Ukraine. The discontented less-privileged re-elected Trump.",
    "Contradictions of post-Cold War globalization: American populist-conservatives view liberal economic globalisation as catapulting China ahead of the US, and are geared to disrupt it to restore American dominance (\u2018MAGA\u2019).",
    "Shifts in the geostrategic balance: China\u2019s rise, relative erosion of US hegemony.",
    "As Macron pronounced, the 30-year post-Cold War period is over.",
    "With Putin\u2019s 2007 Munich speech and the leadership of Xi Jinping came the Eurasian pushback which the global South welcomed\u2014remembering unchecked Western aggression (Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya) when Russia and China were disunited, weak or compliant.",
    "Trump wants to concede and contain Moscow within a Russian-speaking sphere of influence while America focuses on China. UK-EU are blocking Trump\u2019s manoeuvre. These intra-Western contradictions buy time and space for China, which keeps economic globalisation going.",
    "The Trans-Atlanticist liberal-globalist dispensation may return in four years, but not as before. Western hegemony will be fissured, cracked, weakened. The schism in the West-- the global North -- will take some pressure off the South, provide us more elbow room while impelling us to seek it.",
    "While a strong Russia and China furnish the South with an imperative global counterweight, Europe\u2019s autonomy from the US also has a positive aspect: on many issues it adopts positions better than Trump\u2019s America (e.g. Palestine, Cuba, Mexico, Panama).",
    "The current historical transition will have several \u2018storm-centres\u2019, not just Ukraine: Israel/Palestine, Iran, Latin America.",
    "Through the coming turmoil and anarchy, a new global balance, more multipolar, closer to equilibrium, more conducive to us in the Global South because it affords us more autonomy, can and probably will be born. As Mao famously said \u201cthere is great disorder under heavens. The situation is excellent.\u201d",
    "A small, vulnerable state, Sri Lanka must emulate:",
    "n The sagaciously non-aligned creature in the ancient Chinese tale of \u201cthe wise monkey sitting on the mountain top and watching the tigers fight\u201d. (If the monkey is \u2018multi-aligned\u2019 with the fighting tigers, it will be ripped apart).",
    "n The Homeric hero Ulysses who steered his ship through the straits between opposing twin hazards of Scylla and Charybdis, avoiding both (though closer Scylla).",
    "To my mind, Sri Lanka must be guided by and practice 7 Principles:",
    "1. Realism; pursuit of enlightened self-interest.",
    "2. Adroit balance, ambidexterity.",
    "3. All-round global outreach.",
    "4. Global equilibrium as goal.",
    "5. Reject both extremes of isolation and alignment.",
    "6. Maximise international presence, participation and profile.",
    "7. Remain anchored in global South, identify with humanity\u2019s majority.",
