Rituals — collective activities that team members regularly engage in and attribute meaning to — can make a big difference during times of change or transition. Research, which included a survey of 929 individuals from 60 countries and a field study in an advertising company, found that teams with more rituals experienced higher engagement, psychological safety, interpersonal knowledge, and job satisfaction. Five measures can help a team design and implement rituals successfully: leaders having faith in and commitment to the rituals, imbuing the rituals with meaning, being religious about participation, keeping the faith but adapting the practice, and spreading the word about the value of the rituals to other teams.

In times of transition and change, work rituals can make the difference between an overwhelmed, disheartened team and one that is vibrantly engaged and motivated. In a joint project that spans the past three years, we have been studying how rituals can reorient team members and imbue in them a higher sense of meaning and commitment.

We define rituals as collective activities that members of a team engage in regularly and to which they attribute meaning. In our research, we studied and implemented a range of rituals, including facilitated conversations (e.g., icebreakers), team check-in meetings, retrospectives, and formal onboarding processes. We surveyed 929 individuals from 60 countries and ran a field study to implement rituals in an advertising company with 50 employees spread across the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.

To classify the survey responses, we used a scale that took into account both the number of rituals and their frequency. We found that the more rituals a team engages in regularly, the higher their members’ engagement: Those working on teams that scored in the top third of the scale felt 23% more committed to their team’s purpose, experienced a 20% boost to their levels of psychological safety, achieved 28% greater interpersonal knowledge, and reported 22% higher job satisfaction compared to those with low levels of rituals.

While the benefits of rituals are clear, our field research and consulting experience indicate that most leaders and their teams fail to adopt rituals and maintain them faithfully. At the start of the field study, one participant echoed the feelings of others when she noted that her team was “stuck in a bit of an underproductive loop, struggling with how we organized and communicated as a team.”

To help teams design and implement a successful set of rituals, we suggest the following five measures.

1. Leading with faith.

As a leader, you must have faith that rituals will help your team. Without your commitment, they are unlikely to be adopted and maintained over the long haul.

For example, when we began our field study in the advertising agency, skepticism was quite high among both employees and managers. Not everyone saw the value of the changes we were testing. However, one of the leaders, the chief operating officer, was an early believer. He stepped in to clear a pathway for our efforts and became the main champion of the project. Without his early sponsorship, our efforts would have been fruitless.

It is also important to engage your team members in identifying, selecting, and aligning rituals. Otherwise, we have seen teams participate half-heartedly or not at all. Everyone must be willing to take a leap of faith to bring rituals to fruition. In teams where we involved members in the design process, we observed a significantly higher buy-in and participation. For instance, one team co-created a check-in ritual, which quickly became a valued practice.

2. Imbuing rituals with meaning.

The term “ritual” has a religious connotation, and the best team rituals have a transcendent quality that elevates the team’s daily work. To achieve this higher purpose, rituals must be aligned with specific goals (what), the team’s culture (how), and the organizational purpose (why).

In our work, we find teams use rituals to achieve five main goals: 1) strategy and planning, 2) performance management, 3) improving operations, 4) learning, and 5) team engagement and relationship-building.

For example, Marilyn and her team helped create a new operational ritual at a Saudi non-profit. Every month, they met to review their process as a team (rather than their progress) and considered factors such as which handoffs had been smooth, where earlier intervention could have been useful, and how energized they felt about their team’s purpose.

Each retrospective was conducted in the same ritualistic manner. It started with reestablishing the purpose of their work, continued with a facilitated discussion of reflections and suggestions, and ended with mutual commitment towards action steps. This protocol generated rapid and continuous improvement in their operations — without the finger-pointing and defensiveness that can often occur in team reviews.

In the advertising firm, participants helped co-create a new ritual designed to increase social connection. They decided to meet monthly, either in-person or remotely, to get to know each other better. Work topics were out of bounds during these “team time” meetings. We provided a list of discussion prompts and the team selected questions that piqued their interests such as “What part of your childhood would you change if you could?” and “How do you like to receive negative feedback?”

Very quickly, these structured conversations became a cherished team ritual. One team member said, “These check-in calls became more than just updates; they were moments to pause and connect. Through them, we found ourselves opening up, sharing more honestly, and getting to know each other beyond our roles. It transformed how we saw each other and made our team feel more engaged and supportive — something that had been missing before.”

3. Being religious about participation.

Selecting or designing the rituals is the easy part. The hard part is being disciplined about communicating, organizing, and engaging in them. They need to become enshrined in the team’s way of working to achieve their full potential.

This means that participating in rituals should be perceived by all team members as a core aspect of their job and not an optional extracurricular activity. Ritual gatherings should be scheduled on the calendar and treated with the same importance as required business meetings. Leaders must also show up consistently to enact rituals and ensure attendees are clear on the meaning, objective, and definition of success of these gatherings.

For teams new to rituals, we suggest implementing them sequentially, introducing one at a time and testing them out for a few months. In addition, to make sure everyone feels involved, assign an owner for each ritual (you can rotate that role within the team) and have them develop the relevant communication, agendas, or templates needed to run them. As appropriate, record outcomes or action points and follow up to make sure those tasks are completed.

Our study with the advertising agency ended after three months. At the time we departed, we weren’t sure if its people would stick with the rituals we had helped them implement because the company was experiencing some turnover and strategy shifts that threatened to derail their new routines. However, when we surveyed employees six months later, we found that they had become religious about the rituals: 82% reported high levels of observance. One of its executives said, “These strategies, especially the revamped reporting systems and meeting rituals, have become the core of our daily operations, making everything more streamlined and transparent. It’s this foundation that’s really pushed us to evolve and grow.”

4. Keeping the faith but adapting the practice.

Your organization is constantly evolving and so should your rituals. A good operating system is one that adapts over time as the context changes. Accordingly, we recommend reviewing the rituals every six to 12 months to assess whether they have been well implemented, are achieving their stated purpose, and are still relevant.

Don’t be afraid to cancel rituals that no longer serve you, introduce new ones if needed, and most importantly, allow teams to adapt the rituals to their needs, preferences, and cultural context.

For example, in designing a set of engagement-focused rituals, one global company considered that many employees hailed from countries where people abstained from consuming alcohol or being around it. Consequently, it adopted activities that would be acceptable to everyone like bowling and established the practice of holding gatherings that were alcohol-free up until a specific cutoff time.

You will also want to revisit the frequencies of some of your rituals as your team changes. You may start to find that a quarterly offsite simply isn’t affordable anymore or that you no longer require monthly retrospectives.

5. Spreading the word.

Our experience is that rituals often get started in one team with one committed leader. With directed effort, rituals can also be scaled and transferred across teams and to the broader organization. When the rituals start to bear fruit, we suggest teams preach their value to the broader organization. Members can support other teams by teaching them how to facilitate rituals, sharing templates and best practices, and helping them kickstart their process.

When done right, team rituals provide certainty, connection, and space for employees to engage with each other and connect to the purpose of their work. In this way, rituals become a stabilizing force that helps unite and shepherd employees through whatever storms come their way.
