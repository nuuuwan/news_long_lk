    "Research has long shown the importance of self-care \u2014 yet many leaders still struggle to put self-care into practice in their own work lives. Before a leader can sustainably practice self-care, several important mindset shifts are necessary to ensure leaders set themselves up for success. This five-part checklist can help leaders make self-care a reality, including strategies such as making a body budget, managing emotional health, identifying choice points, and prioritizing growth and nourishment. Leaders are encouraged to personalize their plan and practice regularly for optimal health and effectiveness as a leader.",
    "Despite the momentous rise in media attention given to care, resilience, and well-being since the pandemic began, many leaders struggle to implement self-care practices. We know \u2014 from research, experience, and anecdotal evidence \u2014 that we need to care for ourselves for optimal functioning and to become healthier and more efficient leaders, but putting this into practice is another story. Recently, I delivered a week-long leadership training to 30 education leaders from 21 different countries. When asked, not one of the leaders had a regular self-care practice. I see the same trend among my leadership clientele \u2014 also from many different backgrounds, locations, and industries \u2014 who continue to find self-care a challenge.",
