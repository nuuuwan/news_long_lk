The government has issued a gazette on Economic Transformation, proposing changes in the architecture of economic management. This includes the creation of new institutions to deal with the economic crisis. These institutions, described as corporate bodies, would have broad authority and bypass existing structures, with individuals appointed by the President given a three-year tenure. Critics of the proposed Economic Transformation Bill question the urgency behind its enactment, given the controversial nature of certain foreign direct investments being negotiated. They advise delaying its implementation until after an election, when a newly elected president could enact changes with a mandate from the people. Critics also express concern over the institutions' potentially wide-ranging powers and the lack of checks and balances to prevent financial fraud.
