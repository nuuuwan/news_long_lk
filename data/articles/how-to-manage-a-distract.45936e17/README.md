When the news is stressful and anxiety is high, the best managers adopt a more flexible and thoughtful leadership style. There are a few strategies emotionally fluent leaders can use to help their teams navigate the emotional ups and downs of a distracting news cycle: 1) Avoid anxious fixing; 2) give non-update updates; 3) provide a clear path forward; 4) prepare for your team’s emotions; and 5) plan for a dip in productivity.

When people are glued to the news, it can feel especially challenging to be a manager. This November, the week of the U.S. elections will undoubtedly be one of those challenging periods.
