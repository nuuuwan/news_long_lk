    "In this era of AI slop, the idea that generative AI tools like Midjourney and Runway could be used to make art can seem absurd: What possible artistic value is there to be found in the likes of Shrimp Jesus and Ballerina Cappuccina? But amid all the muck, there are people using AI tools with real consideration and intent. Some of them are finding notable success as AI artists: They are gaining huge online followings, selling their work at auction, and even having it exhibited in galleries and museums.\u00a0 Related StoryHow AI can help supercharge creativityRead next \u201cSometimes you need a camera, sometimes AI, and sometimes paint or pencil or any other medium,\u201d says Jacob Adler, a musician and composer who won the top prize at the generative video company Runway\u2019s third annual AI Film Festival for his work Total Pixel Space. \u201cIt\u2019s just one tool that is added to the creator\u2019s toolbox.\u201d\u00a0 One of the most conspicuous features of generative AI tools is their accessibility. With no training and in very little time, you can create an image of whatever you can imagine in whatever style you desire. That\u2019s a key reason AI art has attracted so much criticism: It\u2019s now trivially easy to clog sites like Instagram and TikTok with vapid nonsense, and companies can generate images and video themselves instead of hiring trained artists.  Henry Daubrez created these visuals for a bitcoin NFT titled The Order of Satoshi, which sold at Sotheby\u2019s for $24,000.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Henry Daubrez, an artist and designer who created the AI-generated visuals for a bitcoin NFT that sold for $24,000 at Sotheby\u2019s and is now Google\u2019s first filmmaker in residence, sees that accessibility as one of generative AI\u2019s most positive attributes. People who had long since given up on creative expression, or who simply never had the time to master a medium, are now creating and sharing art, he says.",
    "But that doesn\u2019t mean the first AI-generated masterpiece could come from just anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t think [generative AI] is going to create an entire generation of geniuses,\u201d says Daubrez, who has described himself as an \u201cAI-assisted artist.\u201d Prompting tools like DALL-E and Midjourney might not require technical finesse, but getting those tools to create something interesting, and then evaluating whether the results are any good, takes both imagination and artistic sensibility, he says: \u201cI think we\u2019re getting into a new generation which is going to be driven by taste.\u201d\u00a0  Kira Xonorika\u2019s Trickster is the first piece to use generative AI in the Denver Art Museum\u2019s permanent collection.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Even for artists who do have experience with other media, AI can be more than just a shortcut. Beth Frey, a trained fine artist who shares her AI art on an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers, was drawn to early generative AI tools because of the uncanniness of their creations\u2014she relished the deformed hands and haunting depictions of eating. Over time, the models\u2019 errors have been ironed out, which is part of the reason she hasn\u2019t posted an AI-generated piece on Instagram in over a year. \u201cThe better it gets, the less interesting it is for me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to work harder to get the glitch now.\u201d  Beth Frey\u2019s Instagram account @sentientmuppetfactory features uncanny AI creations.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Making art with AI can require relinquishing control\u2014to the companies that update the tools, and to the tools themselves. For Kira Xonorika, a self-described \u201cAI-collaborative artist\u201d whose short film Trickster is the first generative AI piece in the Denver Art Museum\u2019s permanent collection, that lack of control is part of the appeal. \u201c[What] I really like about AI is the element of unpredictability,\u201d says Xonorika, whose work explores themes such as indigeneity and nonhuman intelligence. \u201cIf you\u2019re open to that, it really enhances and expands ideas that you might have.\u201d But the idea of AI as a co-creator\u2014or even simply as an artistic medium\u2014is still a long way from widespread acceptance. To many people, \u201cAI art\u201d and \u201cAI slop\u201d remain synonymous. And so, as grateful as Daubrez is for the recognition he has received so far, he\u2019s found that pioneering a new form of art in the face of such strong opposition is an emotional mixed bag. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not really accepted that AI is just a tool like any other tool and people will do whatever they want with it\u2014and some of it might be great, some might not be\u2014it\u2019s still going to be sweet [and] sour,\u201d he says. hide"
