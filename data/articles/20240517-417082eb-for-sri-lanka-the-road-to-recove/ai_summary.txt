President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for a new economic reform program to facilitate Sri Lanka's economic recovery, following a severe crisis that peaked a year ago. The country's recovery is hampered by low export and FDI growth, as well as a decade-long period of low productivity stemming from policy inconsistency. To foster sustainable growth, Sri Lanka must enhance its exports through new trade deals and tackle domestic constraints to unlock FDI potential. Key to recovery is rebuilding infrastructure, stabilizing politics, addressing economic challenges, and fostering social cohesion with international support and effective domestic initiatives.

Key areas for Sri Lanka include improving productivity by efficiently utilizing labor and capital, and leveraging relationships with key trading partners. Strong leadership, international community support, and effective administration are crucial. The economy is showing signs of recovery with improved foreign exchange reserves, increased tourism income, and remittances. However, managing sovereign debt and ensuring fair debt restructuring remain significant challenges.

For the future, Sri Lanka's economic prospects lie in trade and investment with a focus on Asia's growing market. An agreement with ASEAN and bilateral trade arrangements can provide significant opportunities. Asian trade is expected to grow considerably, offering Sri Lanka a chance to benefit from new geopolitical trade dynamics.
