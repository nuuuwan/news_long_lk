The solution? A synthetic leader who blends the best of human traits with the precision of robotics

Sri Lanka’s Robotic Governance Council embarks on historic mission to build the politician of the future

As the year 3000 dawns over Sri Lanka, the nation celebrates yet another year of seamless robotic governance. In a landmark meeting held by the National Governance Council, led by the Robotic Leader and three robotic governors, a bold new initiative was launched: the creation of a human-like robotic politician to fill the symbolic “Human Politician” seat of the governance board, left vacant for centuries.

This decision marks a pivotal moment in Sri Lanka’s post-human political evolution. The Council, while proud of its algorithmic efficiency, acknowledged a critical gap, emotional intelligence. Despite their advanced processing capabilities, the robotic governors admitted that their decisions lacked the nuanced empathy and peer review once offered by human politicians. The solution? A synthetic leader who blends the best of human traits with the precision of robotics.

A new kind of politician: Designed for the future

The Council has commissioned a leading robotics firm in the world leader China to develop this next-generation political figure. The project’s terms of reference outline a visionary blueprint for a role model politician, one who embodies the values, skills, and emotional depth required to navigate the complexities of the 31st century.

Here are the foundational traits of this futuristic leader:

Planet-first mindset: Committed to climate resilience and sustainable development.

Interplanetary diplomacy: Skilled in managing relations between Earth and off-world colonies.

Cultural fluency: Deep respect for global traditions, languages, and belief systems.

Technologically literate

AI governance expertise: Crafts ethical policies around automation and digital systems.

Cybersecurity champion: Defends citizen data and digital sovereignty.

Transparent tech use: Promotes open data and participatory platforms to build public trust.

Emotionally intelligent

Empathetic leadership: Listens deeply and responds compassionately.

Resilience under pressure: Maintains clarity and courage during crises.

Authentic communicator: Balances logic with humanity in public discourse.

Post-human ethics: Considers the rights of humans, AI entities, and enhanced beings.

Integrity in complexity: Upholds moral clarity amid shifting norms.

Accountability by design: Builds systems that prevent corruption and welcome scrutiny.

Adaptive problem-solver

Futures thinking: Plans for long-term consequences and scenarios.

Collaborative mindset: Works across disciplines and ideologies.

Policy agility: Updates laws to match fast-moving realities.

Human-centred innovator

Universal basic dignity: Advocates for health, education, and opportunity for all.

Mental health advocate: Prioritises psychological well-being.

Citizen co-creator: Engages the public through immersive, gamified policy platforms.

Mining the past to shape the future

To infuse the robotic politician with authentic human traits, the Council has authorised access to preserved DNA profiles of historical Sri Lankan leaders stored in the National Laboratory. However, the Council has cautioned against using DNA profiles beyond those specified in the Terms of Reference, as Artificial Intelligence induced alterations may have been applied to obscure the original properties of the profiles. These profiles will guide the emotional and strategic coding of the new model. Special footnotes are to be considered.

D.S. Senanayake: Fatherly respect DNA preserved.

S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike: Oratory DNA deemed a benchmark.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike: Diplomatic DNA valuable; economic traits used cautiously. For an alternative, Lakshman Kadirgamar’s Diplomatic DNA profile.

J.R. Jayewardene: Shrewdness DNA preserved; other traits corrupted by “one-man show” syndrome.

R. Premadasa: Common Man Thinking DNA useful; “I don’t like you” DNA rejected.

D.B. Wijetunga: “Non-confrontation” DNA flagged for “no action” contamination.

Chandrika Kumaratunga: “No stress” DNA useful; requires special extraction due to “delayed action” entanglement.

Maithripala Sirisena: “Risk taking” DNA viable; “Risk management” DNA rejected.

Mahinda Rajapaksa: “Boldness” and “Public Relations” DNA recommended; Economic Management DNA corrupted.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa: Only “Project Management” DNA considered usable.

Ranil Wickremesinghe: Alternative source for shrewdness DNA; economic DNA flagged for artificial implants.

Anura Kumara Disanayake: “Empathy” and “Humbleness” DNA approved; “Change Management” DNA underdeveloped.

A new chapter in governance

Once this project is completed, the Humane Robotic Politician will be included into the Robotic Governance Council as a permanent observer. This initiative signals a profound shift in how nations may govern in the centuries to come where emotional intelligence, ethical grounding, and technological mastery converge in a single synthetic leader and adds human touch to robotic decisions. Sri Lanka’s bold step into the future could well become a model for interplanetary governance, proving that even in a robotic age, the human spirit remains indispensable.

Let history witness: the year 3000 is not just a milestone; it is a renaissance.
