In fast-paced, complex business environments, it’s often hard to carve out the time for thoughtful, thorough analysis. Leaders might recognize that better questions lead to better decisions, but they aren’t sure exactly what to ask. These five questions can help. 1) What would happen if we did nothing? 2) What could make us regret this decision? 3) What alternatives did we overlook? 4) How will we know if this was the right decision? 5) Is this reversible?

They can’t be made too quickly, nor can they be avoided. But in our fast-paced, complex business environment, it’s often hard to carve out the time for thoughtful, thorough analysis that yields conclusive answers about the right path forward. We might recognize that better questions lead to better decisions but aren’t sure exactly what to ask.
