The political future looks bleak for ultranationalist bloc Sarvajana Balaya, as the writer predicts they will be wiped out at the next election due to their controversial views. The article also discusses the state of Sri Lanka's democracy and economy, suggesting that a debate between the Economic Councils of the SJB and the NPP would be beneficial. Furthermore, a poll by the Institute of Health Policy revealed that 75 percent of Sri Lankans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction and dissatisfaction is at an all-time high. The writer suggests that the economy is worsening and it is only improving for a minority while many are suffering, indicating there is a disconnect with the public and the Wickremesinghe economic model and the parties supporting it. The writer proposes the solution is to adopt a combination of patriotism and internationalism, without reliance on foreign powers or retreat into secterian ethnoreligious views.
