Open letter to the President and the Prime Minister

Coming out of the import restriction of motor vehicles brought on by the economic crisis, the present policy makers are faced with a golden opportunity to once and for all eradicate the ‘three-wheeler’ menace, which has caused tremendous social costs to our country. In this context, we should spare a moment to reflect on how three-wheelers have caused a decline in our society.

It is needless to say that three-wheelers have an abysmal road safety record. Yet, somehow, these three-wheelers have been brought into the country on a large scale and sold without any safety warnings. The statistics on human fatalities and injuries in road accidents involving three-wheelers, would have rendered severe restrictions on three-wheelers in any other country, if not the complete ban of these death traps.

It is not only for the road accidents and the menacing driving that the three-wheelers are infamous; three-wheelers are closely associated with many of the vices prevalent in society today. Rather than as a mode of transport, three-wheelers have become infamous as the modus operandi of various criminal activities, including underworld heists, drug trafficking and prostitution.

Moreover, three-wheelers are responsible for creating a ‘lost generation’ for Sri Lanka. Generations of youth have opted to drive a three-wheeler, rather than constructively enter the labour force. This situation has created many socio-economic problems. While the productive contributions of these youth have been lost to the economy, the youth themselves have fallen by the wayside and some even reduced to a life of crime.

The current policy makers should realise these issues and implement policies aimed at reducing road accidents and to curb the importation of three-wheelers. Authorities should impose lesser speed limits for three-wheelers, given that three-wheelers are not capable of handling or withstanding high speeds like other motor vehicles. Further, there should be a complete ban of three-wheelers on roads outside the city limits, as the speed of other vehicles on these roads also becomes a relevant factor in a collision.

Although, three-wheelers have caused a decline in society in the manner described above, one private company that is bringing down these three-wheelers has amassed an unimaginable wealth. This private company until recently enjoyed a monopoly status in the three-wheeler market and still is the largest importer and distributor of three-wheelers. It is said that the profits earned by this private company even surpass the profits of some of the largest conglomerates in the country. Not to mention the large scale foreign exchange outflow happening from the country.

This begs the question; has this private company ever been made to internalise any of the above social costs? Whereas, every motorist taking out an insurance policy is required by law to contribute a certain percentage of the insurance premium to the Road Safety fund, which is a fund set up to compensate the victims of road accidents. It appears that successive policy makers have conveniently turned a blind eye to the direct source of these social costs and as per usual practice taxed the public at large instead! Given the number of road accidents involving three-wheelers one could argue the creation of a separate fund entirely from the contributions made by this private company to compensate all the victims of three-wheeler accidents.

It is high time at least now the policy makers and authorities take notice of this situation and not allow this private company to enjoy super normal profits made at the cost of society. The Government should consider imposing one-off taxes on such errant businesses to sanction their behaviour. At the same time, the Government should implement long-term policies aimed at curtailing three-wheeler imports to a complete ban.
