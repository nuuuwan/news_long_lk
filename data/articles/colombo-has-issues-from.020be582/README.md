Former Mayor of Kolonnawa Ravindra Udayashantha has entered the fray to contest under an independent party at the upcoming Parliamentary Elections. Having served as the mayor from 2011-2016 under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ticket, Udayashantha now feels that it is better to contest under an independent party because people have started to reject traditional political parties and politics altogether. In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Udayashantha spoke about his plans to develop Kolonnawa as a hub for commercial activities and his solutions to put an end to the drug menace and the underworld.

Tell us about your journey in politics.

I was inspired to enter politics since my childhood. My hometown and its people were like a university for me. In 2011 I decided to step into active politics. But I had no prior training or experience. I joined the Kolonnawa Municipal Council in 2011 under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ticket. When I read the Provincial Councils Act I realised that it was a document that guided provincial councilors to build a better city for its people. I learned a lot from individuals who served at the provincial council. Even though I faced numerous challenges during my political career I’m committed to help people. Kolonnawa is a UNP stronghold and after 35 years I managed to garner a landslide victory for the SLFP at the Municipal Council. Not even Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra could gain a majority at the Municipal Council. I was committed to serve the people of Kolonnawa as the Mayor and I taught my predecessors to manage finances and other management-related tasks during my tenure.

Why did you decide to contest at the upcoming Parliamentary Elections?

I don’t have a policy to rob and fill my pockets by engaging in politics. I’m contesting from an independent party as an independent candidate. I treat people equally and irrespective of their ethnicity many people in Kolonnawa embrace me. This country has been destroyed due to its political culture. Kolonnawa is a city that needs a strong political leadership. People need a leader so that they travel in the right direction. Mahinda Rajapaksa should have developed Colombo instead of building airports, sports arenas and other infrastructure facilities in Hambantota. Colombo has various issues from housing to urban poverty and unemployment. Even though it is the capital of the country it gets inundated with floods during heavy rains. We would like to present all these issues in writing to the President and discuss how these matters could be brought into the national policy.

We always heard of Sri Lanka as a developing country and thought we will become a developed country one day. But still we are struggling. Therefore I wish to enter Parliament and form a strong political party and work for the people of Kolonnawa and Colombo district.

You said you joined politics as an SLFPer. Then why are you contesting under an independent party this time?

Many major political parties invited me to join them. There are many popular figures from Kolonnawa who have entered the fray and have remained in politics. I felt that I was getting sidelined and I had many disappointments. But I have a goal to nurture the next generation of political leaders and provide some solutions to pressing issues people face. Therefore I decided to contest under an independent party.

Kolonnawa has been a city that became the home ground for many underworld figures, a place that became famous for drugs etc. Do you think you could make a difference in these cultures if you get elected to Parliament?

There are some practical issues here. The underworld is like the unofficial custodians of this country. It’s not just in Kolonnawa. There has been political and religious unrest which we have experienced as well. It is these politicians who have fostered and nurtured the underworld. I know how many politicians received money from drug dealers and this is how the underworld was born. There have been many clashes among underworld groups but none of the politicians intervened to bring a solution to this problem. Politicians never thought that it was their responsibility to put them on the right track. Nobody has spoken about providing rehabilitation for those involved in the underworld and reintegrating them back into society. The families of underworld figures suffer in silence, their children also fall into the wrong track, their spouses elope with other men and it is a grave social crisis which needs to be addressed. We need to empower the youth and provide them with potential job opportunities. There are many underworld figures who are operating from overseas. I believe that they should be brought into the country under a special law and instead of killing them, they should be brought before the law and maximum punishment needs to be enforced on them.

Do you think the current government would be able to eradicate the underworld?

I supported Anura Kumara Dissanayake during the Presidential Election. We need to support them to reap maximum benefits. If they get a majority in Parliament they should act sensibly and prove their words through actions. They shouldn’t get unlimited power and if that happens this country will become unstable again. We have hopes on the new President. So let’s wait and see.

Your message to voters.

We are an independent party and we want to see professionals engaging in politics. Give this government a chance to perform. The government should also give people the chance to live freely as per the Constitution.
