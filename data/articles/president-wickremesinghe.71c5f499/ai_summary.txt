Opinions:

- Wickremesinghe's call to 'not to follow' the Special Determination on the Gender Equality Bill is seen as undermining the authority of the Supreme Court and the country's constitution.
- Not paying heed to the constitution and addressing the issue of gender disparity with care may expose Sri Lanka's vulnerable LBGTQ minority to further risks.
- The President's address to Parliament, mocking the Supreme Court's position on the Gender Equality Bill, is considered disrespectful and a wider attack on the judiciary overall. 
- The President's reference to the 1972 Constitution that declared 'Parliament is sovereign' is perceived as a possible threat to the checks and balances between the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary enshrined in the constitution.
- The controversy over the Gender Equality Bill reflects a lack of rational public debate and creates confusion, exacerbated by political rivalries.
