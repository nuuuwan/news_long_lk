Often, we try to correct mistakes. Parents try to correct mistakes of children and teachers try to correct mistakes of students. But, by correcting mistakes are we sabotaging the learning effect? And when it comes to the competitive landscape isn’t it better to let the competitors make mistakes? This is where the strategic silence comes into play.

Strategic silence is when you intentionally choose not to speak or react immediately to achieve a specific outcome. Often it is a short-term pause expecting a medium-term positive outcome.

Some people are born with the ‘’strategic silence’’ skill and others must work hard to develop this critical skill. Of course, silence doesn’t come across as a skill in our day-to-day life. But it is a critical skill we tend to learn very late in life. But if you can learn this potent skill early in your career you are on to a winner. What is stopping us from acquiring this skill? There are many obstacles to gaining this critical skill early in your career. What are they?

natural bias to react and/or tell our story

desire to “win” an argument

viewing silence as losing status

lack of understanding the value of silence

underestimating the cost of quick reaction

We want quick solutions to complex problems. With the increasing use of AI and social media, we have become impatient because they solve many problems quickly. So, things stack up against strategic silence and taking the time and waiting on solutions.

However, the discipline to remain a silent observer is a rare and potent form of power. There are three key benefits behind this approach:

conservation of energy

avoidance of self-inflicted decline

avoidance of unintended consolidation/withdrawal

preserving family and community relationships

Let’s explore the above four benefits of silence. When discussions/arguments become intense and emotional we expend our energy for little or no marginal benefit. At times arguments drain energy from both parties for no reward. Our energy is not unlimited, and we must expend it sparingly. For some with a strong negative bias, a brief assertive comment can cause days or even weeks of trauma. That depletes energy. Contrary to what you may think, this is a self-inflicted decline. What is viewed as a quick gain/win may turn out to be a drain on your energy. Quick impulsive reactions can also cause unintended consolidation of power and withdrawal. When it comes to family, there are many instances to consider silence as gold. When a family member or a colleague “unleashes” on you for no fault of yours, the initial response is to react and defend. Consequently, the outcome is often depletion of energy and weakening/destroying the relationship with the person concerned. Silence, on the other hand, gives time to heal and calm down.

In any competitive landscape - be it geopolitics, business, or personal disputes - energy is a finite resource. Reacting to an adversary’s error often requires an expenditure of capital, reputation, or time. Haven’t we all experienced how we drain our energy during a heated argument? When we jump to capitalise on a mistake, we risk:

Creating a distraction: Your intervention might draw attention away from their blunder and onto your aggression. Your aggression becomes the focus.

Providing a "common enemy": A failing opponent often finds new life when they can pivot from their internal failure to a defensive stance against an external attacker. It becomes an off-ramp.

By watching patiently, you allow the full weight of the mistake to settle, ensuring the adversary exhausts their own resources trying to fix a problem they created.

A mistake is rarely a single event. It is usually the beginning of a process. If an adversary is heading down a path of poor logic or logistical error, the most effective "attack" is the passage of time. Just watch the downhill movement.

When you react too early, you provide the adversary with an early warning signal. Your reaction tells them that they are being watched and that their current course is significant enough to warrant your concern. This often prompts them to self-correct. In a family and community environment allowing self-correction may be prudent depending on the situation and the vulnerability of the family member. But in a business environment, conversely, silence acts as a vacuum. In the absence of external pressure, an adversary is more likely to double down on their error, believing it has gone unnoticed or that it is succeeding.

Advantage of emotional intelligence

There is a psychological advantage to composure. But it requires a reservoir of emotional intelligence. Composure comes with experience. In a professional or public setting, the party that remains calm while the other is in disarray gains the "mandate of stability". This can be priceless. By not reacting, you demonstrate:

You are so secure in your position that their errors do not threaten you

You are not driven by impulse or emotion, but by observation and facts

You have chosen to save your energy

When you practice strategic silence, it becomes a part of your being. There is no need to force yourself to be silent. It will be intuitive. You will sense the space without in depth analysis of the space. And that becomes a potent leadership tool.

Strategic silence is not a passive thing. It is a deliberate choice and calculated action. It requires a high degree of emotional intelligence to suppress the instinct to shout from the rooftops when an opponent falters. It comes with experience and training. The most decisive victories are often those where the adversary defeats themselves. In the end, watching patiently is not just about waiting for a downfall - it is about ensuring that when you finally do move, you are moving toward a goal, rather than just reacting to an argument. And that is highly likely to put you in a commanding position. It is often a strategic power play. The key is to keep your emotional intelligence reservoir and overall well-being in good shape to practice strategic silence. It is powerful but risky when misinterpreted. It may appear as indifference, avoidance, or hostility if overused or used without intention.
