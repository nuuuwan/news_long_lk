While media coverage is largely on the Presidential Election which is to be held on September 21, today marks an important day on the calendar– that is the International Day of Charity.

In a statement, the United Nations (UN) stated that Charity provides ample opportunities for bonding between communities and societies, thereby contributing to more inclusive societies, just like volunteerism and philanthropy. Charity also helps alleviate those worst hit by humanitarian crises, supplement public services in health care, education, housing and child protection.

It must be acknowledged that charity assists in the development of culture, sciences, sports, and also protects cultural and natural heritage. It promotes the rights of the marginalised and underprivileged and spreads the message of humanity in conflict situations.

The International Day of Charity had been established with the objective of sensitising and mobilising people, Non-Governmental Organisations, and stakeholders across the world to lend a helping hand to the vulnerable through volunteer and philanthropic activities.

According to the UN, the date, September 5, had been especially chosen in effort to commemorate the anniversary of the passing away of Mother Teresa the renowned nun and missionary, who was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in 1910,  and moved to India in 1928 where she devoted herself to helping the destitute. Twenty years later, she became an Indian citizen and founded the order of Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta which became noted for its work among the poor and the dying in that city.

For over 45 years she tended to the poor, sick, orphaned and dying, while guiding the Missionaries of Charity’s expansion, first in India and then in other countries, including hospices and homes for the poorest and homeless. Mother Teresa’s work has been recognised and acclaimed throughout the world and she has received a number of awards and distinctions. She died on September 5th 1997, at 87 years of age. She has now been canonised as a saint.

Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for the work she undertook in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace.

In recognition of the role of charity in alleviating humanitarian crises and human suffering within and among nations, as well as of the efforts of charitable organisations and individuals, including the work of Mother Teresa, the General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution A/RES/67/105 designated the 5th of September, the anniversary of the death of Mother Teresa, as the International Day of Charity.

In the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development adopted in September 2015, the UN recognised that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. The Agenda calls for a spirit of strengthened global solidarity, focused in particular on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable. It also acknowledges the role of the diverse private sector, ranging from micro-enterprises to cooperatives to multinationals, and that of civil society organisations and philanthropic organisations in the implementation of the new Agenda.

The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth in the Agenda can be grouped into six critical areas: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. They have the potential to transform lives and the planet we live in by providing the framework needed for philanthropic institutions to enable all people to contribute to the betterment of the world.
