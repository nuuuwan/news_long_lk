    "Most projects and strategies at some point require a course correction. But choosing to pivot when it\u2019s not necessary can be costly: A leader could send their team in an unproductive direction, wasting time, resources, and engagement; they could delay the achievement of the team\u2019s goals; and they could squander the confidence of their stakeholders. The author has identified three questions that leaders can ask themselves in advance of a change in direction to make sure they aren\u2019t pivoting for the wrong reasons: poor execution, external pressure, or the lure of a shiny new opportunity.",
    "One of the only certainties of management is that all projects and strategies will, at some point, require a pivot or course correction. New technologies emerge, competitors do the unexpected, and plans are never perfect. That\u2019s why agility and rapid adaptation are such critical leadership skills (as long as they are exercised, as I\u2019ve written previously, with a focus on changing the means to achieve the goals, but not the goals themselves).",
