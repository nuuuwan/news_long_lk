    "Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn\u2019t always easy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created the AI Hype Index\u2014a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.  Last year, the fantasy author Joanna Maciejewska went viral (if such a thing is still possible on X) with a post saying \u201cI want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.\u201d Clearly, it struck a chord with the disaffected masses.Regrettably, 18 months after Maciejewska\u2019s post,\u00a0the entertainment industry insists that machines should make art and artists should do laundry. The streaming platform Disney+ has plans to let its users generate their own content from its intellectual property instead of, y\u2019know, paying humans to make some new Star Wars or Marvel movies.  Elsewhere, it seems AI-generated music is resonating with a depressingly large audience, given that the AI band Breaking Rust has topped Billboard\u2019s Country Digital Song Sales chart. If the people demand AI slop, who are we to deny them? hide"
