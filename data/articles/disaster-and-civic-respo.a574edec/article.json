    "This article is Part II of the article published under the same headline with a broader analysis of the events surrounding Cyclone Ditwah, with particular emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of relevant Government agencies, as well as the collective responsibility of the public, in managing and mitigating the impacts of the disaster.",
    "Role of the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO)",
    "The NBRO issues highly accurate early warnings by integrating meteorological data with its own landslide early\u2011warning sensor networks and computer\u2011based models. Japan\u2019s JICA has repeatedly supported the NBRO with advanced equipment and specialised training. Although the NBRO\u2019s landslide division operates with limited staff, it has implemented effective mitigation measures in hilly regions and along major road networks.",
    "However, protecting individuals who live in extremely unsafe conditions on steep hilltops cannot be the sole responsibility of the NBRO. As a first step, no construction approvals should be granted in officially designated landslide\u2011prone zones. Environmentally destructive projects and soil\u2011eroding agricultural practices in highland areas must also be strictly prohibited.",
    "Role of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC)",
    "The Disaster Management Centre comprises officers seconded from the tri\u2011forces, police, and other services, as well as civilian officials. Upon receiving early warnings, the DMC immediately alerts all District Disaster Management Committees and places lifesaving units on standby. Maintaining uninterrupted 24\u2011hour communication systems is essential during emergencies, and District Committees remain in continuous contact with the DMC\u2019s central operations room in Colombo.",
    "The DMC also plays a vital role in community education. Recently, in collaboration with the Department of Meteorology and other agencies, it conducted a tsunami preparedness drill that significantly improved awareness among coastal communities.",
    "However, during severe disasters, communication and power infrastructure often fail, as occurred during Cyclone Ditwah, when terrestrial communication systems were severely disrupted. Managing disasters under such conditions becomes extremely challenging, underscoring the urgent need for satellite\u2011based communication systems.",
    "Tragically, during relief operations in Nattandiya, a Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter crashed, killing a highly experienced squadron leader. Naval personnel, an army soldier, a police officer, and a Ceylon Electricity Board technical officer also lost their lives during rescue and reconstruction efforts. These sacrifices are beyond any monetary valuation.",
    "The reconstruction phase",
    "Sri Lanka has now entered the national reconstruction phase. Countries such as Japan, Indonesia, and New Zealand have demonstrated that recovery from major natural disasters is possible through structured, sustainable interventions and strong legal frameworks. While these responsibilities rest primarily with the Government, rapid recovery is achievable when the State and the public work together with a shared sense of responsibility.",
    "This disaster struck while the country was still emerging from the severe economic crisis of 2022. Yet the immediate response has been encouraging: volunteer groups, organisations, and the tri\u2011forces mobilised swiftly. Severely damaged bridges, roads, railway lines, canals, weirs, and reservoir embankments are already being restored at an impressive pace. The dedication of these teams reflects the enduring national spirit often celebrated in Sri Lanka\u2019s historical narratives.",
    "Many public servants have worked far beyond their standard duty hours, collaborating closely with volunteer groups which is an unmistakable sign of national commitment. As citizens, it is equally important that we resume economic and social activities promptly. International assistance, while invaluable, cannot continue indefinitely. In the coming years, work must proceed without strikes or disruptions, and the Government must act responsibly without imposing undue burdens on the public. Political differences must be set aside in favour of collective national effort.",
    "Key proposals for the future",
    "Urgent modernisation of the Department of Meteorology",
    "To improve early detection of severe weather hazards, the Department of Meteorology must be modernised without further delay. Although some improvements were made after the 2004 tsunami, a World Bank\u2013funded project proposed around 2015 was repeatedly delayed until 2025 due to political instability and recurring natural disasters.",
    "A controversial project initiated in 2007 to procure the \u201cGongala Doppler Radar\u201d at a cost of Rs. 400 million was eventually abandoned. The radar, to be purchased from Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC) in Alabama, USA, with technical support from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), failed during factory acceptance testing in 2010. Despite this failure, a senior official intervened to have the defective system shipped to Sri Lanka.",
    "Installation plans were further disrupted when a crane (planned to use installation of the radar\u2019s heavy antenna) fell enroute to the Gongala mountain top, damaging the access road. After months of repairs, EEC engineers inspected the stored components and refused to proceed with installation. The WMO was notified, and UNOPS conducted an independent inspection. Although the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption began an inquiry in 2016, investigations were later halted. The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) also raised concerns. Some defective components were reportedly shipped back to the United States at additional cost, but there is no evidence they were repaired or returned. Several components stored at Gongala were later stolen, and although a police complaint was filed, no resolution has been reported.",
    "A significant positive development occurred in 2015 when agreements were signed under a JICA\u2011funded project to install two state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art C\u2011Band Pulse Compression Solid\u2011State Dual\u2011Polarisation Doppler Radar systems at Puttalam and Pottuvil.",
    "With the installation of these two Doppler radar systems, Sri Lanka\u2019s landmass as well as its surrounding coastal and maritime zones would receive comprehensive radar coverage. This capability would facilitate the timely acquisition of radar imagery and enable continuous monitoring of developing low\u2011pressure systems, cyclone trajectories, storm dynamics, wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and extensive feeder\u2011band activity.",
    "From the earliest stages of cyclone formation, Doppler radar functions as an essential forecasting tool, providing accurate, continuous, high\u2011resolution observations even when cyclonic systems are located up to approximately 300 kilometres away. Such capacity is vital for enhancing the accuracy of early warnings and extending lead times for preparedness and response in addition to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) techniques.",
    "However, precise quantitative rainfall forecasting ultimately requires the validation and calibration of radar\u2011derived estimates against ground\u2011based measurements. This process depends on reliable data from the Department\u2019s network of automatic rain gauges, which are indispensable for verifying and refining precipitation forecasts from a radar system.",
    "An examination of cyclones, severe cyclonic storms, and intense low\u2011pressure systems",
    "(or deep depression systems) that have affected Sri Lanka over the past seven decades clearly shows that the vast majority have approached the island from the east, north\u2011east, and south\u2011east. As illustrated in the figure above, a Doppler radar installed in Pottuvil would therefore provide significantly more effective monitoring of upper\u2011atmospheric behaviour over the south\u2011eastern and eastern maritime regions than a radar located in Puttalam.",
    "Under the original JICA\u2011supported project, two state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art Doppler radar systems were to be installed, ensuring full coverage of Sri Lanka\u2019s landmass and surrounding maritime zones. By 2018, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had granted the necessary frequency allocations, and most other institutional approvals had been secured by 2017.",
    "In this context, it is important to determine whether delays in implementing the project stemmed from decisions taken by senior officials within the Department of Meteorology or from broader institutional or administrative constraints. The suspension of nearly all Japanese\u2011funded projects in Sri Lanka after 2019 also contributed significantly to the postponement of this initiative.",
    "With the recent resumption of previously suspended Japanese projects, the Doppler radar initiative has been revived. However, due to global cost escalations, the project now provides for only one radar system instead of the originally planned two. In my professional assessment, if only a single Doppler radar can be installed, Pottuvil is the more appropriate and strategically valuable location, mainly for tracking cyclones or low-pressure areas.\u00a0 Given the country\u2019s current disaster\u2011risk landscape, re\u2011engaging with JICA to explore the feasibility of installing the second radar in Pottuvil would be of immense benefit to the Department of Meteorology",
    "Additional key recommendations",
    "1. Transition to satellite\u2011based communication systems",
    "Adopt satellite\u2011based communication platforms (e.g., Starlink) for data transmission from the Department of Meteorology\u2019s Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and Automatic Rain Gauges, replacing vulnerable ground\u2011based infrastructure.",
    "2. Strengthen public trust in weather forecasts",
    "Enhance credibility by adopting globally recognised Impact\u2011Based Forecasting, which not only states expected weather conditions (e.g., 100 mm of rainfall) but also explains their likely impacts on people, infrastructure, and livelihoods. This user\u2011centric approach increases public attention and trust.",
    "3. Modernise monitoring networks across technical agencies",
    "Extend satellite\u2011based communication systems to the Department of Irrigation and NBRO for transmitting data from automatic rain gauges, water\u2011level sensors, and flow\u2011measurement devices.",
    "4. Upgrade emergency communication for the DMC",
    "Equip the Disaster Management Centre with satellite\u2011based communication systems to ensure uninterrupted coordination during emergencies. Initial engagement with Starlink is a promising step.",
    "5. Standardise emergency broadcasting",
    "During declared disaster emergencies, require all television and radio broadcasters to simultaneously transmit official announcements. This prevents misinformation and ensures the public receives clear, unified instructions. Alerts should also be disseminated via SMS, and internationally recognised systems such as the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) should be adopted.",
    "6. Enforce disaster\u2011resilient construction standards",
    "All reconstruction must comply strictly with the Sri Lanka Building Code and relevant standards. Preparatory work for these codes, initiated with World Bank support, should be accelerated. Many highly experienced Sri Lankan and expatriate engineers have offered their expertise voluntarily and excessive institutional bureaucracy must not impede their contribution.",
    "7.Regulate reconstruction in high\u2011risk zones",
    "Introduce new regulations requiring that rebuilding in mountainous regions and areas adjacent to reservoirs strictly follow NBRO recommendations.",
    "8. Reactivate Disaster Committees",
    "Reinstate the Disaster Committees mandated under the Disaster Management Act and amend any provisions requiring strengthening or modernisation.",
    "9. Strengthen technical capacity",
    "Recruit qualified personnel for key technical institutions and provide them with appropriate local and overseas training. Engage final\u2011year university students in technical support roles to build future capacity.",
    "10.Enhance international cooperation",
    "Expand international partnerships on disaster management and establish personnel\u2011exchange mechanisms for major emergencies.",
    "11.Assess and secure vulnerable hospitals",
    "Identify hospitals at risk from natural hazards and either relocate them or eliminate the sources of risk.",
    "12. Establish resilient public facilities",
    "Construct permanent public buildings in disaster\u2011prone areas or upgrade existing facilities, and provide structured, practical disaster\u2011response training to nearby communities under DMC coordination.",
    "13.Raise public awareness",
    "Strengthen disaster\u2011risk education, particularly among schoolchildren, to build long\u2011term community resilience.",
    "14.Promote household emergency preparedness",
    "Encourage families to maintain a small \u201cEmergency Disaster Kit\u201d containing essential items such as water, dry food, medicines, first\u2011aid supplies, important documents, national identity cards, and a battery\u2011operated radio.",
    "15.Conduct seasonal preparedness programs",
    "Before monsoon seasons, implement public awareness campaigns and practical drills in high\u2011risk areas on basic safety measures and first aid during floods, landslides, and lightning events.",
    "In the aftermath of a major disaster, it is imperative that authorities adopt sustainable, scientifically sound, and long\u2011term solutions before rebuilding the country. At the same time, every citizen has a responsibility to contribute, swiftly, constructively, and with a shared sense of national purpose, to the recovery and resilience of Sri Lanka.",
