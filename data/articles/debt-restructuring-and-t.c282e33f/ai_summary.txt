🌐 Sri Lanka's government struggles with public outcry over debt forgiveness or restructuring.
😕 Local elites misunderstand debt procedures, expecting complete forgiveness of bilaterally postponed debt.
🌏 The reality is debt restructuring involving a reduction of principal due, adjustment of the payment period, or altering interest charges. It must benefit both creditor and debtor.
🇨🇳 China, a significant bilateral lender to Sri Lanka, refuses to agree to a principal haircut on their loans. This decision could influence other creditors. 
💰 Local leaders borrowed heavily from China and other commercial entities after 2007, steering away from globally recognized lending institutions due to their strict conditions. 
🏦 The government can address its external debt by purchasing dollars from local banks whilst paying in rupees. Additional debts could be incurred in dollars or rupees to fund this operation.
🔻 In the first nine months of 2023, the Government managed to raise only 36% of its tax revenue from direct taxes (personal and corporate income taxes). The remaining percentage came from indirect taxes.
🔀 Direct taxes provide accountability and can be increased by rate inflation or expanding the taxable population. Yet, this move could spark protests from influential persons.
⚖️ It is estimated that 45% of the increased tax revenues to be raised will be necessary to service the debt, even post-restructuring.
📈 Boosting exports is a unanimous decision, but the disagreement lies in how to eliminate the challenges impeding exporting growth. Direct taxes and VAT may increase to pave the way for phasing out para tariffs, potentially causing professionals to leave the country.
