Monday is the Public Day at all Government offices. Yesterday I visited the Education Ministry to meet with no less than four top officials. Two of them (Acting Director Bi-lingual Education, Director National Schools) weren’t at their offices because they were called for meetings by their superiors. At the Deputy Minister Hon. Madhura Senevirathna’s office, there was no one even to tell where the Minister was.

A month ago, I went to meet the Zonal Director Education in Colombo 2 and he was conducting a well-attended discussion with all his top subordinates and the poor teachers numbering at least 50, were waiting like displaced with permanent resigned looks shrouded by hopelessness.

Dear Mr President, I am not asking too much from you. Either change the Public Day or ban meetings for all top officials on Mondays.
