The article discusses the functionality and potential risks associated with post-dated cheques, particularly in Sri Lanka where their use is common but declining. Such cheques, which are dated for cashing in the future, can bounce due to insufficient funds, or be used fraudulently if lost or stolen, leading to strained relationships and financial loss. While some businesses and individuals value the perceived control and tradition of using such cheques, there is a shift towards electronic payment methods, which provide faster processing, enhanced security, and superior record-keeping. Businesses are advised to shift to these methods, while the government is encouraged to promote digital literacy and infrastructure, and consider legal changes limiting the use of cheques.
