Opinions expressed: 
- The authors did not believe the current economic policy program, defined in the 17th Agreement with the IMF, provided a sustainable path for Sri Lanka's recovery.
- They felt the economic growth targets in the program were excessively optimistic, ignoring the potential adverse impact of fiscal measures.
- The current program's quantitative goals, in their opinion, did not account for the structural conditions that led to the crisis or for global stability issues.
- They criticized the IMF's debt sustainability analysis for underestimating the required external debt reduction, leading to an unlikely debt relief.
- They believe the legislative drive to convert policy measures into binding laws through the Economic Transformation Bill undermined democratic norms.
- They argued that the IMF program's adjustments disproportionately impacted the poor and vulnerable members of society, causing grave socioeconomic disruptions.
- They called for a renegotiation of the terms of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF and a change in dealing with creditors. 
- They suggested that all future foreign borrowing should be approved by Parliament and publicized for public discussion.
