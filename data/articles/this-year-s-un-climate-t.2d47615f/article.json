    "If we didn\u2019t have pictures and videos, I almost wouldn\u2019t believe the imagery that came out of this year\u2019s UN climate talks. Over the past few weeks in Belem, Brazil, attendees dealt with oppressive heat and flooding, and at one point a literal fire broke out, delaying negotiations. The symbolism was almost too much to bear.  While many, including the president of Brazil, framed this year\u2019s conference as one of action, the talks ended with a watered-down agreement. The final draft doesn\u2019t even include the phrase \u201cfossil fuels.\u201d As emissions and global temperatures reach record highs again this year, I\u2019m left wondering: Why is it so hard to formally acknowledge what\u2019s causing the problem?",
    "This is the 30th time that leaders have gathered for the Conference of the Parties, or COP, an annual UN conference focused on climate change. COP30 also marks 10 years since the gathering that produced the Paris Agreement, in which world powers committed to limiting global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2.0 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels, with a goal of staying below the 1.5 \u00b0C mark. (That\u2019s 3.6 \u00b0F and 2.7 \u00b0F, respectively, for my fellow Americans.) Before the conference kicked off this year, host country Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, cast this as the \u201cimplementation COP\u201d and called for negotiators to focus on action, and specifically to deliver a road map for a global transition away from fossil fuels.",
    "The science is clear\u2014burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases and drives climate change. Reports have shown that meeting the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C would require stopping new fossil-fuel exploration and development. The problem is, \u201cfossil fuels\u201d might as well be a curse word at global climate negotiations. Two years ago, fights over how to address fossil fuels brought talks at COP28 to a standstill. (It\u2019s worth noting that the conference was hosted in Dubai in the UAE, and the leader was literally the head of the country\u2019s national oil company.) The agreement in Dubai ended up including a line that called on countries to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. It was short of what many advocates wanted, which was a more explicit call to phase out fossil fuels entirely. But it was still hailed as a win. As I wrote at the time: \u201cThe bar is truly on the floor.\u201d Related StoryWho\u2019s to blame for climate change? It\u2019s surprisingly complicated.Read next And yet this year, it seems we\u2019ve dug into the basement. At one point about 80 countries, a little under half of those present, demanded a concrete plan to move away from fossil fuels. But oil producers like Saudi Arabia were insistent that fossil fuels not be singled out. Other countries, including some in Africa and Asia, also made a very fair point: Western nations like the US have burned the most fossil fuels and benefited from it economically. This contingent maintains that legacy polluters have a unique responsibility to finance the transition for less wealthy and developing nations rather than simply barring them from taking the same development route.\u00a0 The US, by the way, didn\u2019t send a formal delegation to the talks, for the first time in 30 years. But the absence spoke volumes. In a statement to the New York Times that sidestepped the COP talks, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said that president Trump had \u201cset a strong example for the rest of the world\u201d by pursuing new fossil-fuel development. To sum up: Some countries are economically dependent on fossil fuels, some don\u2019t want to stop depending on fossil fuels without incentives from other countries, and the current US administration would rather keep using fossil fuels than switch to other energy sources.",
    "All those factors combined help explain why, in its final form, COP30\u2019s agreement doesn\u2019t name fossil fuels at all. Instead, there\u2019s a vague line that leaders should take into account the decisions made in Dubai, and an acknowledgement that the \u201cglobal transition towards low greenhouse-gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.\u201d Hopefully, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s concerning that even on the world\u2019s biggest stage, naming what we\u2019re supposed to be transitioning away from and putting together any sort of plan to actually do it seems to be impossible.
