To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here. This week, an office conversation turned to body weight. We all know that being overweight is not great for your health\u2014it\u2019s linked to metabolic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular problems. But weighing yourself won\u2019t tell you all you need to know about your disease risk.  A friend of mine is a super-fit marathon runner. She\u2019s all lean muscle. And yet according to her body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight relative to height, she\u2019s overweight. Which is frankly ridiculous.

But the societal impact can\u2019t be measured in views.",
    "I, on the other hand, have never been all that muscular. I like to think I\u2019m a healthy weight\u2014but nurses in the past have advised me, on the basis of my BMI, to eat more butter and doughnuts. This is advice I never expected to receive from a health professional. (I should add here that my friend and I are roughly the same height and wear the same size in clothes.)",
    "The BMI is flawed. So what should we be using instead? There are several high-tech alternatives, but a simple measure that involves lying on your back could also tell you about how your body size might influence your health. First, let\u2019s talk about fat\u2014the most demonized of all body components. Fat is stored in adipose tissue, which has some really important functions. It stores energy, keeps us warm, and provides protective cushioning for our organs. It also produces a whole host of important substances, from hormones that control our appetite to chemicals that influence the way our immune systems work.",
    "Not all fat is equal, either. Our bodies contain white fat, brown fat, and beige fat. While white fat stores energy, brown fat helps burn calories. Beige fat tissue contains a mixture of the two. And white fat can also be broken down into two additional categories: the type under your skin is different from that which covers your internal organs. It\u2019s the visceral fat\u2014the type surrounding your organs\u2014that is thought to be more harmful to your health, if there\u2019s too much of it. Having more visceral fat has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. (That relationship isn\u2019t straightforward either, though; studies have shown that removing this \u201cexcess\u201d fat doesn\u2019t improve metabolic health.) Either way, having a good idea of how much fat is in your body, and where it is, would be valuable. It might at least give us some idea of our risk of metabolic disorders. There are quite a few different ways of measuring this. BMI is the most widely adopted. It\u2019s the official measure the World Health Organization uses to define overweight and obesity. On the plus side, it\u2019s very easy to calculate your BMI. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t tell you very much about the fat in your body or how it corresponds to your health. After all, your body weight includes your bones, muscles, blood, and everything else, not just your fat. (And as we\u2019ve seen, it can lead well-meaning health practitioners to recommend weight loss or weight gain when it\u2019s really not appropriate.)

    "Scanners that can specifically measure fat are more useful here. Typically, doctors can use a DEXA scan, which relies on x-rays, to give an idea of where and how much body fat a person has. CT scanners (which also makes use of x-rays) and MRI scanners (which use magnets) can give similar information. The problem is that these are not all that convenient\u2014they\u2019re expensive and require a hospital visit. Not only that, but standard equipment can\u2019t accommodate people with severe obesity, and people with some medical implants can\u2019t use MRI scanners. We need simpler and easier measures, too. Measuring the circumference of a person\u2019s waist seems to yield more useful information than BMI. Both waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios can give a better idea of a person\u2019s risk of developing diseases associated with excess weight. But this isn\u2019t all that easy either\u2014measuring tapes can stretch or slip, and it can be difficult to measure the exact same part of a person\u2019s waist multiple times. And the measure seems to be a better indicator of health in men than in women. Instead, Emma B\u00f6rgeson, who studies cardiometabolic disease at Aarhus University in Denmark, and her colleagues recommend the SAD measure. SAD stands for sagittal abdominal diameter, and it\u2019s a measure of the size of a person\u2019s belly from back to front. To measure your SAD, you need to lie on your back. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle to make sure your back is not arching and is flush with the floor. Then measure how much your belly protrudes from the ground when you exhale. (The best way to do this is with a sliding-beam caliper.)",
    "In this position, the fat under the skin will slide to the sides of your body, while the visceral fat will be held in place. Because of this, the SAD can give you a good idea of how much of the more \u201cdangerous\u201d kind of fat you have. The fat can be trimmed down with diet and exercise. This measure was first proposed in the 1980s but never took off. That needs to change, B\u00f6rgeson and her colleagues argue in a paper published in Nature Reviews Endocrinology a few months ago. \u201cSAD is simple, affordable, and easier to implement than waist-to-hip based measurements,\u201d the team writes. \u201cWe would argue for its extended use.\u201d  Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro are wildly popular and effective; they were named one of MIT Technology Review\u2019s 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2024. Abdullahi Tsanni explored what we know\u2014and don\u2019t know\u2014about their long-term effects. Over the last couple of years, those weight-loss drugs have taken over the internet, with users sharing stories of their miraculous results on social media. But the day-to-day reality of weight-loss injections isn\u2019t always pleasant\u2014and some side effects are particularly nasty, Amelia Tait reported last year. A future alternative could be vibrating pills that trick you into feeling full. For now, it seems to work in pigs, as Cassandra Willyard reported last year. When you lose weight, where does it go? It kind of depends on your metabolism, as Bonnie Tsui explains. We don\u2019t fully understand how weight-loss drugs like Ozempic work. That\u2019s partly because we don\u2019t fully understand how hunger works. Adam Piore reported on the painstaking hunt for the neurons that control the primitive urge to eat.
