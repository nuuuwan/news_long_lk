Venerable Galboda Gnanissara Thera

The following is a press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade Royal Government of Bhutan:

Most Venerable Assaji Thero,

I am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Venerable Galboda Gnanissara Thera, a renowned Buddhist monk of Sri Lanka. Late Venerable Thera will be remembered and cherished in Bhutan as one of the personalities whose contributions significantly helped strengthen the friendly relations between Sri Lanka and Bhutan, and more specifically between the Gangaramaya temple and Bhutan.

We remain grateful for the warm welcome and kind hospitality that the late Venerable Thera generously extended to the Royal Family Members, Prime Minister and other important dignitaries of Bhutan during their visits to the Gangaramaya Temple. Personally, I still remember with gratitude Late Venerable Theraâ€™s kind gesture shown towards me on the occasions when I visited the temple, during my tenure as non-resident Ambassador of Bhutan to Sri Lanka. The demise of the late Venerable Thera is a great loss for Sri Lanka and for the Buddhist community. He will be dearly missed by all those whose lives he touched with his love and compassion. His contributions towards the propagation of the profound teachings of the Buddha for peace and happiness in the world will always be celebrated, and serve as an inspiration for all.

On behalf of the Royal Government and people of Bhutan, I wish to offer our heartfelt condolences to the Sangha of the Gangaramaya Temple for the great loss. We pray for the blessings of the Triple Gem to be upon the Late Venerable Galboda Gnanissara Thera,

Bhutanese Foreign Secretary
