    "When Ditwah ripped through bridges, buried tracks, and crippled services, it did not cause a crisis. It revealed one that had been a disaster waiting to happen",
    "Cyclone Ditwah didn\u2019t simply wash away Sri Lanka\u2019s railway tracks. It washed away our excuses.",
    "For decades, Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) has been the classic state-owned paradox: socially vital, fiscally fragile, structurally neglected \u2013 and politically untouchable. When Ditwah ripped through bridges, buried tracks, and crippled services, it did not cause a crisis. It revealed one that had been a disaster waiting to happen.",
    "Now, in the dismaying aftermath, the real question is not how fast we will rebuild the railway. It is what kind of railway we choose to rebuild. And whether we are bold enough to move from patchwork repairs to structural change.",
    "The backbone we forgot",
    "The former Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) is not only a nostalgic colonial relic. It was also paradoxically a working system: 1,593 kilometres of national track linking regions, livelihoods, and opportunities.",
    "In 2023 alone, SLR transported 109.15 million passengers and moved nearly 1.99 million tons of freight, generating total revenue of approximately Rs. 16,079 million. But its operating and capital expenditures were over Rs. 38,983 million, leaving the system mired in persistent deficits.",
    "And in a country squeezed by fuel imports (Sri Lanka spends billions of dollars annually on such imports), congested roads and climate shocks, rail is the cheapest, cleanest, and most socially inclusive mass transport available.",
    "Yet it has been starved of investment while expected to act as a welfare instrument, a jobs program, and a political soundbite for successive administrations keen to be perceived as \u2018people-friendly\u2019 and supportive of public sector jobs \u2013 all at once.",
    "Revenue has lagged lamentably and unacceptably far behind running costs. Rollingstock has aged dismally. Signalling systems have stayed obsolete. Many stations (some of them colonial relicts, others modern monstrosities) have decayed. Drainage, bridges, culverts, cuttings, tunnels, embankments, and stations were not built for the climate or ecological context we now live in.",
    "Then Ditwah arrived. And decimated the network.",
    "When climate meets neglect",
    "The cyclone hit the railway like the Down Express at full tilt. Large sections of the network were knocked out. Lines were twisted, embankments washed away, bridges weakened. Landslides blocked mountain stretches \u2013 especially along the sections of the Main Line between Kandy and Badulla, where slopes gave way and foundations were undermined.",
    "At the peak of the disruption, only around 30% of the network was operational, meaning that roughly 478 kilometres of track remained usable.",
    "In the aftermath, Government reports documented 91 places where tracks were damaged, 73 bridges were affected, and dozens of culverts and smaller stations impaired.",
    "Even weeks later, operations limped back in phases \u2013 prioritising high-demand corridors, although stranded regulars would disagree \u2013 while hill country and secondary segments remained under repair. By late December 2025, about 69% (1,098 km) of the network had resumed services.",
    "This is not simply a story of cyclone-induced damage. It is a story of infrastructure designed for yesterday\u2019s climate, maintained with yesterday\u2019s budgets, managed with yesterday\u2019s institutions \u2013 and expected somehow to survive today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s storms.",
    "The estimates are sobering. Restoring the damaged rail infrastructure alone is projected to cost about $ 400 million \u2013 only to bring the network back to pre-storm functionality.",
    "But that figure does not include broader network modernisation or investments to make the system resilient to future climate shocks.",
    "And spending that kind of money merely to return to fragility would be the most expensive mistake we could make.",
    "The trap we must avoid",
    "Beyond SLR, Sri Lanka at large faces a familiar temptation after every disaster:",
    "Patch. Rebuild under build-back-better. Move on.",
    "We repair what failed \u2013 instead of asking why it failed. We pour money into the visible (tracks, sleepers, bridges) while ignoring the invisible: governance, incentives, project delivery discipline, and long-term planning.",
    "If we follow that script again, Ditwah will become just another chapter in a long book titled \u201cMissed Opportunities\u201d.",
    "Because the truth is blunt: the system was already failing. The cyclone only cleared the fog.",
    "The devastating tropical storm laid bare three structural weaknesses:",
    "1. Infrastructure built for another era",
    "Much of SLR\u2019s physical network dates back more than a century, with incremental upgrades that have never matched the pace of demand or climate risk.",
    "Drainage channels are inadequate for torrential rainfall, slopes remain unstable, and bridges were not retrofitted for higher flood loads. Signalling systems lag decades behind peer systems, contributing to inefficiencies and safety risks.",
    "So then when extreme weather hits, damage multiplies.",
    "That vulnerability is not unique to Sri Lanka. But it is avoidable for an island nation that has long hovered on the cusp of being dragged into the 21st century.",
    "Railways in other countries in the South Asian region have strengthened embankments, installed modern drainage, and retrofitted bridges to withstand heavier rainfall patterns. Why not here?",
    "2. Institutional and financial fragility",
    "SLR\u2019s fiscal gaps were apparent long before Ditwah.",
    "The railway department earned Rs. 16,079 million in revenue in 2023, but its total expenditures (operational plus capital expenses) were Rs. 38,983 million \u2013 a structural deficit that forced repeated reliance on governmental subventions.",
    "Chronic funding shortfalls have translated into deferred maintenance, dilapidated infrastructure and limited capacity to invest in automation, digital systems, or modern rollingstock.",
    "Political micromanagement distorts priorities and delays projects. Procurement is slow, fragmented, and vulnerable to interference. Capital spending is inconsistent. It is a system asked to deliver modern outcomes \u2013 with 20th century rules and 19th century infrastructure.",
    "3. Poor passenger experience",
    "Operational inefficiencies such as infrequent services, delays, overcrowding, and unreliable booking systems have eroded public confidence. Tourists don\u2019t come for unpredictable timetables; freight operators shift to roads.",
    "Commuters adapt, but confidence erodes.",
    "This is not a marginal inconvenience. It is a subtraction from national productivity, a drag on tourism revenues, and an incentive for more polluting modes of transport.",
    "The fork in the track",
    "We have only two choices. We can reconstruct the railway so that it looks like it did on the day before Ditwah. Or we can rebuild it so that it survives the storm that comes after the next Ditwah.",
    "That means treating rail not as a sentimental asset \u2013 but as critical national infrastructure that supports economic growth, disaster resilience, climate strategy, and social mobility.",
    "It also means recognising that \u2018business as usual\u2019 will guarantee failure.",
    "What rebuilding should really mean",
    "Rebuilding must be about resilience, governance, and smarter partnerships \u2013 not simply concrete and steel.",
    "Build for the climate we have",
    "Embankments, culverts, bridges, drainage, slopes \u2013 everything must be redesigned to withstand heavier rainfall, rising water tables, and landslide risk. Detailed climate risk mapping should drive investment, not political geography.",
    "Every rupee spent on resilience now saves multiples later. We cannot afford to rebuild weak.",
    "Reform how the railway is governed",
    "A more autonomous rail authority with clear mandates, ring-fenced budgets, real performance targets, and transparent procurement is not a luxury. It is the only way to ensure continuity across governments, avoid stop-start projects such as the much vaunted, arbitrarily abandoned and now resurrected (?) Light Rail Transit (LRT) project \u2013 and reduce political foot dragging.",
    "Accountability is itself resilience.",
    "Fund strategically, not episodically",
    "Multi-year capital planning, resilience funds, and contingency financing must become the norm. We can also expand revenue beyond fares \u2013 through commercial leases, logistics hubs, advertising, and station retail \u2013 reducing pressure on the state budget.",
    "Fares can be rationalised carefully and gradually, and paired with targeted subsidies, so essential mobility is preserved.",
    "The goal is not necessarily profit. The goal is definitely sustainability.",
    "Where the private sector fits \u2013 and where it doesn\u2019t",
    "The debate over public-private partnerships (PPPs) is often ideological. It should be practical.",
    "PPPs are not about \u2018selling our railway.\u2019 They are about using private expertise and capital where it actually helps \u2013 under strict guardrails.",
    "Rolling stock leasing: Modern locomotives and carriages can be leased under long-term contracts, reducing upfront fiscal pressure.",
    "Signalling and digital systems: Private partners can be contracted to provide and maintain advanced signalling, telecommunications, and asset management systems with performance incentives.",
    "Station redevelopment: Major stations can be transformed into integrated mobility hubs with retail, logistics, and services under concession agreements, generating non-fare revenue.",
    "Freight logistics hubs: Intermodal terminals at key junctions can attract private logistics firms, shifting cargo from road to rail.",
    "Sri Lanka already has PPP experience. There are some 179 PPP projects valued at $ 5.3 billion across ports, energy, and infrastructure. This indicates an existing legal framework that could extend to rail projects.",
    "At the same time, the State must remain responsible for core network stewardship, safety regulation, and long-term planning.",
    "Done badly, PPPs privatise gains and socialise losses. Done well, they can speed timelines, reduce costs, and raise standards.",
    "The difference lies entirely in governance.",
    "Innovation isn\u2019t optional",
    "Sri Lanka cannot modernise its railway while treating it as a museum.",
    "Predictive maintenance using sensors and real-time data, passenger information systems, reliable e-ticketing, digital asset management \u2013 these are not futuristic add-ons. They reduce breakdowns, cut costs, and build trust now.",
    "Academic research already demonstrates the potential of IoT-based systems to optimise maintenance and operations in Sri Lankan rail contexts.",
    "Some of this innovation will come from local tech firms, others from global partnerships. All of it requires one thing we lack: institutional readiness to adopt and manage change.",
    "We should start small, pilot quickly, learn fast \u2013 and scale what works.",
    "Counting the costs honestly",
    "There is bad news. Recovery will not be cheap. But if it is to be done, and it has to be, it can and must be done well, meaningfully and realistically.",
    "Here is a rough but arguably realistically projected breakdown of present needs as indicated by research:",
    "These figures span infrastructure, resilience, technology, and commercial upgrades \u2013 and are not mutually exclusive. They represent a comprehensive vision, not a limited repair budget.",
    "The real comparison is not between spending and saving. It is between spending now \u2013 or paying repeatedly in lost productivity, higher road congestion, oil imports, avoidable accidents, service collapses, and yet another round of emergency repairs after the next extreme weather event.",
    "Rail is not an expense line. It is a risk-reduction strategy, an economic enabler, and a social equaliser.",
    "The politics of courage",
    "Every reform flagged here is politically difficult.",
    "Autonomous authorities reduce ministerial discretion. Transparent procurement challenges entrenched interests. PPP guardrails frustrate rent-seekers. Careful fare reform invites controversy.",
    "But the alternative is a cycle of decay that punishes the poor the most, drains the national budget, and traps the country in perpetual reactive mode.",
    "Savvy political leadership in the present context means saying plainly:",
    "We will protect low-income travellers \u2013 but we will not subsidise inefficiency forever.",
    "We will partner with the private sector \u2013 but we will not compromise the public interest.",
    "We will rebuild the railway network \u2013 and we will not only rebuild it better but differently.",
    "A test of national seriousness",
    "How Sri Lanka treats its railway after Ditwah is a proxy for something greater than good governance alone. It is a proof yet to be demonstrated whether the country as a whole is willing to move from reactive crisis management to strategic, sustainable, long-term thinking.",
    "We cannot keep waiting for disasters to justify reforms we already know are necessary.",
    "We know the infrastructure was fragile. We know the governance model was outdated. We know climate shocks will intensify. We know rail is indispensable.",
    "So, the case for change is not technical. It is moral, ethical, and practical.",
    "A system worth building",
    "Imagine a network that:",
    "Survives storms with minimal disruption",
    "Connects regions with reliable, affordable mobility",
    "Shifts freight off highways, reducing wear on roads",
    "Supports tourism with predictability and comfort",
    "Reduces emissions and fuel dependence",
    "Earns trust by working \u2013 every day",
    "This is not utopian. Countries poorer than Sri Lanka have done it. Countries with worse starting points have done it.",
    "The difference is not money. It is discipline, continuity, and the refusal to treat disaster recovery as a paint job.",
    "The window will close",
    "Cyclone Ditwah has created an unusual alignment: public awareness, donor attention, and political necessity. That alignment will not last.",
    "Reform delayed will be reform denied. If we simply patch, clear debris, and declare victory, we will have wasted the most valuable asset a crisis can give: legitimacy for change. One that was promised, and one for which a cardinal opportunity was delivered by fate, karma, chance, destiny, the curse of Kuveni. Take your pick \u2013 and pick up the slack.",
    "Don\u2019t rebuild \u2013 redesign",
    "Sri Lanka stands at a railroad junction.",
    "Down one track lies the comfortable path: rebuild what we had, amber light blinking, delays baked in, deficits widening, future storms waiting to repeat the trauma.",
    "Down the other lies a harder path: governance reform, climate-proofing, disciplined PPPs, smarter funding, and technological modernisation.",
    "Only one of those tracks leads out of crisis.",
    "Cyclone Ditwah forced us to stop. What we choose to lay next \u2013 rails, rules, and responsibilities \u2013 will decide whether the next generation inherits a resilient national asset or another fragile repair bill.",
    "This time, we should not merely get Sri Lanka Railways back on track. We should lay a better track altogether.",
