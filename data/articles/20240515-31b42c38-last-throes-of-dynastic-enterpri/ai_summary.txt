The article criticizes former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa for perpetuating a culture of impunity and self-preservation at the expense of the country's welfare. Rajapaksa is portrayed as having mismanaged the economy, including the national airline, and engineering a failed attempt at dynastic control, resulting in a severe financial crisis. Despite his fall from favor, Rajapaksa continues to manipulate political scenarios for personal and familial gain, notably opposing the restructuring of loss-making state enterprises to keep political leverage for his son Namal. The article contends that such actions stall necessary economic reforms and maintain chaos to benefit the Rajapaksa family, at the country's expense. It calls out the lack of accountability and contrasts this with countries where rule of law holds politicians accountable for economic mismanagement. Finally, it underscores that President Wickremesinghe's failure to counter these schemes jeopardizes crucial reform efforts and could tarnish his legacy.
