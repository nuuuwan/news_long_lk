In my work with engineers, I’ve seen firsthand the quest for better signal-to-noise ratios. In non-engineering terms, signal is the thing we want, and noise is everything else. Signal is the input — what we’re trying to do or communicate — whereas noise is the undesired and unintended outcome. If an idea or word is noisy, that means people often lack clarity on what it actually is because the original signal has degraded by the time it reaches the masses. For example, the term AI is loaded with noise right now. If you ask 10 people what AI means, they’re going to give 10 very different answers based on their personal situation, industry, political ideology, and more.

The metaphor of signal and noise is especially helpful when trying to understand the hotly debated idea of diversity in the workplace.

The word diversity itself appears to trigger a wide variety of emotions from its equally wide array of definitions. This means that in the diversity space, we have really poor signal — or a lot of noise. And in our current moment of political polarization, it appears to be getting worse. When speaking and consulting, I often ask leaders, “Why is diversity important for your team?” It’s a simple question that can catch smart leaders on the back foot. After a few umms and ahhs, I hear a variety of answers, most of which are loaded with noise.

There is a much better way to frame diversity that offers a clear return on investment for teams and companies.

Common Value Propositions for Diversity

First, let’s discuss three common diversity value propositions, then we’ll get into a more productive alternative.

1. Diversity helps us sell more.

This is one of the most popular value propositions for diversity. The clean signal here is: “Diversity in our company makes us relevant to our diverse pool of customers and helps us build products and experiences that serve them more effectively.”

While this signal emphasizes the profitability ROI of diversity, it also tokenizes diverse team members by reducing them to a single identity that helps the company drive sales. For example, in a consumer products brand trying to expand its base of women customers, the women hired onto the team may be seen by their coworkers as a gimmicky investment in helping only “sell to women.” The noise, or unintended consequence, of this value proposition is that newly hired diverse team members may feel exploited, or not fully included, if they think they’re only there to help drive a diversity sales strategy.

2. Diversity repairs harm.

This proposition comes from the truth that some groups of people have been structurally barred from full participation in society through a variety of systemic and interpersonal practices of exclusion. As a result, investing in diversity can be seen as a way to repair this harm.

The clean signal on this value proposition is: “Diversity is the right thing to do for our society, and it will benefit historically underserved and excluded groups.” The noise associated with this signal is: “Diversity efforts only benefit oppressed groups.” This can elicit defensive postures in groups whose members begin to ask, “What am I losing in order for others to gain?”

Additionally, in for-profit organizations, this diversity value proposition positions diversity as an altruistic investment rather than one that would result in ROI, which could help it garner better support.

3. Companies with diverse leadership teams are more successful.

In the last decade, I’ve witnessed this value proposition show up as a reflex for diversity champions in corporate spaces, who say, “Well, we know diverse companies are more profitable…” as a primary justification for investing in diversity. In recent corporate history, Sheryl Sandberg’s 2013 book, Lean In, and McKinsey & Company’s 2015 study of corporate profitability and diversity helped create the narrative that highly successful companies tended to have more diverse executive leadership and board representation. The clean signal here is: “If diversifying our executive layer and our boards leads to increased profitability, then this is something we all want, right?”

Unfortunately, this signal is loaded with noise. First, diversity in U.S. companies is often measured using race and gender data, due to Equal Employment Opportunity laws that require companies with more than 100 employees to collect and report it. Since these categories of data are more consistently available, researchers often use this data to make the argument. However, years of reporting on “diversity gains” by showcasing only two categories of diversity has had the unintended consequence of conflating the very definition of diversity with just race and gender.

Second, the evidence of profitability often triggers skepticism from business leaders who see this as correlative, rather than causative data. To put it plainly, when I share this value proposition with senior business executives, they often respond with, “Well, those companies were already highly successful, and they used their vast resources to go out and buy the diversity later.” Or they simply point out that there is little evidence that proves that the increases in diversity linearly drove the companies’ profitability.

Finally, this signal has the noise of emphasizing diversity just in the top levels of organizations, which feeds into the performative tactic of hiring a few executives who look different so the company can achieve the optics of caring about diversity.

A Better Value Proposition: Diverse Teams Consistently Outperform

What if we could frame a value proposition for diversity that emphasizes the return on investment for the organization, benefits every individual and team, and is rooted in science and backed by empirical research? Luckily, we have this at our fingertips, and this model is better suited to our current social tensions and avoids some of the pitfalls of the common value propositions we’ve discussed.

The bold claim that diverse teams outperform consistently has two parts. First, we must reframe the word diversity itself. And second, we need a keen understanding of the science of how high-performing teams innovate.

Diversity is complexity.

First, let’s reframe diversity itself as complexity. Not complicated, mind you — complex.

According to organizational psychologists, diversity can be understood as a mix of inherent and acquired traits. Inherent traits are out of your control. They can include where you were born, your native language, whether you’re right-hand or left-hand dominant, or your economic status in early childhood, for example. Acquired traits can vary throughout your life, like second languages, your caregiver status for elders or children, or your current economic class status. Both inherent and acquired traits have a powerful shaping influence over how you understand yourself, others, and the world around you.

When we expand our definition of diversity from narrow, legally protected categories like race and gender to a more comprehensive understanding of inherent and acquired traits, we unlock the power of a new, clean signal: Every person is a web of complexity because of their inherent and acquired traits. This complexity has considerable bearing on how each of us understands ourselves, engages with others, and sees the world. If we pursue a truly diverse mix of employees in our organizations and on our teams, we will increase complexity on our teams.

But why is complexity helpful? Remember, our new definition of diversity must have a laser focus on ROI.

Complexity delivers high performance.

Most organizations exist to create value through developing products, processes, ideas, people, or solutions. When people work on collaborative teams to drive an organization’s outcomes, the teams are expected to produce innovative solutions to tough problems.

Complexity serves as friction, and in the science of innovation, friction can be a productive force. Complex teams, loaded with inherent and acquired diverse traits, have built-in friction that contributes to better outcomes. The diversity of these teams can be an advantage, because it offers the team plenty of opportunities to question assumptions, think differently, and capitalize on outlier viewpoints.

In contrast, more homogeneous teams have less friction to help them innovate. These teams are at risk of groupthink, which hurts successful innovation. The products, ideas, or services they create are missing the productive force of friction and are at greater risk of under-delivering.

There is evidence of the productive power of complexity and friction in peer-reviewed research. Scientists conducted an experimental study across two continents using teams of financially literate participants. The participants were given extensive financial data on fictitious companies. The task across the two experiment sites was the same: to identify the stock price of these companies based on the data provided. The key variable in the experiment was the composition of the teams. Some teams were intentionally constructed to be homogenous across multiple factors such as age, race, and gender. Other teams were constructed to be more diverse using the same composite index of diversity.

The diverse teams were 58% more likely to pick the stock price of the companies accurately. While this is a significant finding, the explanation provided by the researchers is even more important. They concluded that the more-diverse teams had greater friction, which served to “enhance deliberation and upend conformity.” In other words, the friction was the difference-maker in the study. To tie it back to the value proposition for diversity, complexity unlocked better outcomes by increasing deliberation and lowering conformity, which are both critical to innovation.

For organizational leaders seeking to optimize performance with their people and teams, complexity is a key ingredient. When we assemble complex teams, we harness the power of friction in service of our organization’s goals and competitive outcomes. Broadly pursuing diversity, beyond just race and gender, is a powerful way to fast-track inherent and acquired differences into our teams, which can set the foundation for teams that outperform consistently.

In this time of social polarization, the commonly used value propositions of diversity are too loaded with noise. Complexity offers a low-noise way to cleanly link the investment in diversity to innovation and high-performing teams. This value proposition allows leaders to build momentum for change and have every member of the team see diversity as the winning investment it is.
