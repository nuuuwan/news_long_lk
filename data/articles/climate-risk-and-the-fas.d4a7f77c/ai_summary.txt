👗 Sri Lanka's vibrant fashion and textile industry, a significant part of the country’s cultural heritage, can drive sustainable fashion due to its natural resources. 

📈 The industry has traditionally been a significant source of employment, export revenue, and economic growth in Sri Lanka.

🌳 However, it also faces risks due to market factors, global and domestic supply chains, and climate change.

🌞 The tropical climate of Sri Lanka poses challenges in the conservation of textiles while the impacts of climate change bring new threats including extreme weather events, heat stress and power outages.

🌪️ Climate change impacts the sector due to its reliance on natural resources such as agricultural products, fibers, and plant-based dyes that can be disrupted by heavy rainfall or prolonged droughts.

🌡️ Rising temperatures, particularly in the tropics, can affect the health of workers, causing conditions such as heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat rashes, or heat strokes.

🧵 Climate change could also lead to cultural loss, impacting the traditional crafts that are an integral part of Sri Lankan culture, as many younger people migrate away due to climate change impacts. 

💸 Small-scale entrepreneurs face high risk from climate change due to lack of financial stability that would allow for recovery after unexpected shocks.

🧠 Climate change also affects mental health. Workers and entrepreneurs facing job insecurity, loss of income, or displacement may experience increased anxiety and depression.

📚 To adapt and manage these risks, it is essential to have enterprise risk management plans and systems, better infrastructure, and climate-smart facilities. Investing in traditional crafts and promoting sustainable, eco-friendly practices are also needed.
