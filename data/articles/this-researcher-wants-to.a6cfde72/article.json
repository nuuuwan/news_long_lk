    "A US agency pursuing moonshot health breakthroughs has hired a researcher advocating an extremely radical plan for defeating death. His idea? Replace your body parts. All of them. Even your brain.\u00a0  Jean H\u00e9bert, a new hire with the US Advanced Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), is expected to lead a major new initiative around \u201cfunctional brain tissue replacement,\u201d the idea of adding youthful tissue to people\u2019s brains.\u00a0 President Joe Biden created ARPA-H in 2022, as an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, to pursue what he called\u00a0 \u201cbold, urgent innovation\u201d with transformative potential.",
    "The brain renewal concept could have applications such as treating stroke victims, who lose areas of brain function. But H\u00e9bert, a biologist at the Albert Einstein school of medicine, has most often proposed total brain replacement, along with replacing other parts of our anatomy, as the only plausible means of avoiding death from old age. As he described in his 2020 book, Replacing Aging, H\u00e9bert thinks that to live indefinitely people must find a way to substitute all their body parts with young ones, much like a high-mileage car is kept going with new struts and spark plugs.",
    "Related StoryAging hits us in our 40s and 60s. But well-being doesn\u2019t have to fall off a cliff.Lifestyle changes could counter some of the deterioration.",
    "The idea has a halo of plausibility since there are already liver transplants and titanium hips, artificial corneas and substitute heart valves. The trickiest part is your brain. That ages, too, shrinking dramatically in old age. But you don\u2019t want to swap it out for another\u2014because it is you. And that\u2019s where H\u00e9bert's research comes in. He\u2019s been exploring ways to \u201cprogressively\u201d replace a brain by adding bits of youthful tissue made in a lab. The process would have to be done slowly enough, in steps, that your brain could adapt, relocating memories and your self-identity.\u00a0\u00a0 During a visit this spring to his lab at Albert Einstein, H\u00e9bert showed MIT Technology Review how he has been carrying out initial experiments with mice, removing small sections of their\u00a0brains and injecting slurries of embryonic cells. It\u2019s a step toward proving whether such youthful tissue can survive and take over important functions. To be sure, the strategy is not widely accepted, even among researchers in the aging field. \u201cOn the surface it sounds completely insane, but I was surprised how good a case he could make for it,\u201d says Matthew Scholz, CEO of aging research company Ois\u00edn Biotechnologies, who met with H\u00e9bert this year.\u00a0  Scholz is still skeptical though. \u201cA new brain is not going to be a popular item,\u201d he says. \u201cThe surgical element of it is going to be very severe, no matter how you slice it.\u201d Now, though, H\u00e9bert's ideas appear to have gotten a huge endorsement from the US government. H\u00e9bert told MIT Technology Review that he had proposed a $110 million project to ARPA-H to prove his ideas in monkeys and other animals, and that the government \u201cdidn\u2019t blink\u201d at the figure.\u00a0 ARPA-H confirmed this week that it had hired H\u00e9bert as a program manager.\u00a0 The agency, modeled on DARPA, the Department of Defense organization that developed stealth fighters, gives managers unprecedented leeway in awarding contracts to develop novel technologies. Among its first programs are efforts to develop at-home\u00a0cancer tests and cure blindness with eye transplants.",
    "President Biden created ARPA-H in 2022 to pursue \u201cbold, urgent innovation\u201d with transformative potential. It may be several months before details of the new project are announced, and it\u2019s possible that ARPA-H will establish more conventional goals like treating stroke victims and Alzheimer\u2019s patients, whose brains are damaged, rather than the more radical idea of extreme life extension.\u00a0 \u201cIf it can work, forget aging; it would be useful for all kinds of neurodegenerative disease,\u201d says Justin Rebo, a longevity scientist and entrepreneur. But defeating death is H\u00e9bert's stated aim. \u201cI was a weird kid and when I found out that we all fall apart and die, I was like, \u2018Why is everybody okay with this?\u2019 And that has pretty much guided everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI just prefer life over this slow degradation into nonexistence that biology has planned for all of us.\u201d  H\u00e9bert, now 58, also recalls when he began thinking that the human form might not be set in stone. It was upon seeing the 1973 movie Westworld, in which the gun-slinging villain, played by Yul Brynner, turns out to be an android. \u201cThat really stuck with me,\u201d H\u00e9bert said. Lately, H\u00e9bert has become something of a star figure among immortalists, a fringe community devoted to never dying. That\u2019s because he\u2019s an established scientist who is willing to propose extreme steps to avoid death.\u00a0\u201cA lot of people want radical life extension without a radical approach. People want to take a pill, and that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d says Kai Micah Mills, who runs a company, Cryopets, developing ways to deep-freeze cats and dogs for future reanimation. The reason pharmaceuticals won\u2019t ever stop aging, H\u00e9bert says, is that time affects all of our organs and cells and even degrades substances such as elastin, one of the molecular glues that holds our bodies together. So even if, say, gene therapy could rejuvenate the DNA inside cells, a concept some companies are exploring, H\u00e9bert believes we\u2019re still doomed as the scaffolding around them comes undone.

But it might be real someday.\u00a0BrainBridge is best understood as the first public billboard for a hugely controversial scheme to defeat death.",
    "One organization promoting H\u00e9bert's ideas is the Longevity Biotech Fellowship (LBF), a self-described group of \u201chardcore\u201d life extension enthusiasts, which this year published a technical roadmap for defeating aging altogether. In it, they used data from H\u00e9bert's ARPA-H proposal to argue in favor of extending life with gradual brain replacement for elderly subjects, as well as transplant of their heads onto the bodies of \u201cnon-sentient\u201d human clones, raised to lack a functioning brain of their own, a procedure they referred to as \u201cbody transplant.\u201d",
    "Such a startling feat would involve several technologies that don\u2019t yet exist, including a means to attach a transplanted head to a spinal cord. Even so, the group rates \u201creplacement\u201d as the most likely way to conquer death, claiming it would take only 10 years and $3.6 billion to demonstrate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require you to understand aging,\u201d says Mark Hamalainen, co-founder of the research and education group. \u201cThat is why Jean\u2019s work is interesting.\u201d",
    "H\u00e9bert's connections to such far-out concepts (he serves as a mentor in LBF\u2019s training sessions) could make him an edgy choice for ARPA-H, a young agency whose budget is $1.5 billion a year. For instance, Hebert recently said on a podcast with Hamalainen that human fetuses might be used as a potential source of life-extending parts for elderly people. That would be ethical to do, H\u00e9bert said during the program, if the fetus is young enough that there \u201care no neurons, no sentience, and no person.\u201d And according to a meeting agenda viewed by MIT Technology Review, H\u00e9bert was also a featured speaker at an online pitch session held last year on full \u201cbody replacement,\u201d which included biohackers and an expert in primate cloning.  H\u00e9bert declined to describe the session, which he said was not recorded \u201cout of respect for those who preferred discretion.\u201d But he\u2019s in favor of growing non-sentient human bodies. \u201cI am in conversation with all these groups because, you know, not only is my brain slowly deteriorating, but so is the rest of my body,\u201d says H\u00e9bert. \u201cI'm going to need other body parts as well.\u201d The focus of H\u00e9bert's own scientific work is the neocortex, the outer part of the brain that looks like a pile of extra-thick noodles and which houses most of our senses, reasoning, and memory. The neocortex is \u201carguably the most important part of who we are as individuals,\u201d says H\u00e9bert, as well as \u201cmaybe the most complex structure in the world.\u201d There are two reasons he believes the neocortex could be replaced, albeit only slowly. The first is evidence from rare cases of benign brain tumors, like a man described in the medical literature who developed a growth the size of an orange. Yet because it grew very slowly, the man\u2019s brain was able to adjust, shifting memories elsewhere, and his behavior and speech never seemed to change\u2014even when the tumor was removed.\u00a0 That\u2019s proof, H\u00e9bert thinks, that replacing the neocortex little by little could be achieved \u201cwithout losing the information encoded in it\u201d such as a person\u2019s self-identity.",
    "The second source of hope, he says, is experiments showing that fetal-stage cells can survive, and even function, when transplanted into the brains of adults. For instance, medical tests underway are showing that young neurons can integrate into the brains of people who have epilepsy \u00a0and stop their seizures.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was these two things together\u2014the plastic nature of brains and the ability to add new tissue\u2014that, to me, were like, \u2018Ah, now there has got to be a way,\u2019\u201d says H\u00e9bert. \u201cI just prefer life over this slow degradation into nonexistence that biology has planned for all of us.\u201d One challenge ahead is how to manufacture the replacement brain bits, or what Hebert has called \u201cfacsimiles\u201d of neocortical tissue. During a visit to his lab at Albert Einstein, H\u00e9bert described plans to manually assemble chunks of youthful brain tissue using stem cells. These parts, he says, would not be fully developed, but instead be similar to what\u2019s found in a still-developing fetal brain. That way, upon transplant, they\u2019d be able to finish maturing, integrate into your brain, and be \u201cready to absorb and learn your information.\u201d",
    "To design the youthful bits of neocortex, H\u00e9bert has been studying brains of aborted human fetuses 5 to 8 weeks of age. He\u2019s been measuring what cells are present, and in what numbers and locations, to try to guide the manufacture of similar structures in the lab. \u201cWhat we're engineering is a fetal-like neocortical tissue that has all the cell types and structure needed to develop into normal tissue on its own,\u201d says H\u00e9bert.\u00a0 Part of the work has been carried out by a startup company, BE Therapeutics (it stands for Brain Engineering), located in a suite on Einstein\u2019s campus and which is funded by Apollo Health Ventures, VitaDAO, and with contributions from a New York State development fund. The company had only two employees when MIT Technology Review visited this spring, and the its future is uncertain, says H\u00e9bert, now that he\u2019s joining ARPA-H and closing his lab at Einstein. Because it\u2019s often challenging to manufacture even a single cell type from stem cells, making a facsimile of the neocortex involving a dozen cell types isn\u2019t an easy project. In fact, it\u2019s just one of several scientific problems standing between you and a younger brain, some of which might never have practical solutions. \u201cThere is a saying in engineering. You are allowed one miracle, but if you need more than one, find another plan,\u201d says Scholz. Maybe the crucial unknown is whether young bits of neocortex will ever correctly function inside an elderly person\u2019s brain, for example by establishing connections or storing and sending electro-chemical information. Despite evidence the brain can incorporate individual transplanted cells, that\u2019s never been robustly proven for larger bits of tissue, says Rusty Gage, a biologist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and who is considered a pioneer of neural transplants. He says researchers for years have tried to transplant larger parts of fetal animal brains into adult animals, but with inconclusive results. \u201cIf it worked, we\u2019d all be doing more of it,\u201d he says. The problem, says Gage, isn\u2019t whether the tissue can survive, but whether it can participate in the workings of an existing brain. \u201cI am not dissing his hypothesis. But that\u2019s all it is,\u201d says Gage. \u201cYes, fetal or embryonic tissue can mature in the adult brain. But whether it replaces the function of the dysfunctional area is an experiment he needs to do, if he wants to convince the world he has actually replaced an aged section with a new section.\u201d In his new role at ARPA-H, it\u2019s expected that H\u00e9bert will have a large budget to fund scientists to try and prove his ideas can work. He agrees it won\u2019t be easy. \u201cWe're, you know, a couple steps away from reversing brain aging,\u201d says H\u00e9bert. \u201cA couple of big steps away, I should say.\u201d hide"
