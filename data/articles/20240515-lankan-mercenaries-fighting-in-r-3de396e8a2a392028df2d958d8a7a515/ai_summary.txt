The article discusses the involvement of ex-military personnel from Sri Lanka in the ongoing Russo-Ukraine conflict. With many Ukrainian men fleeing to avoid military service, recruiters are seeking experienced foreign soldiers. Sri Lanka's large number of battle-hardened troops, many of whom are either idling or have deserted, make them prime targets for recruitment. Media reports highlight that local facilitators, including a former Major General and ex-sergeant, are aiding recruitment efforts.

Since the end of the civil war, Sri Lankan veterans have seen their special allowances cut and are now struggling with basic wages, pushing many into low-paying security jobs or the underworld. The Sri Lankan Army's website has issued warnings against illegal recruitment scams. However, attractive compensation offered by foreign recruiters, such as salaries up to Rs. 2 million, is luring many veterans, providing a dignified alternative to poor local wages and criminal activities.

The government also sends troops as 'peacekeepers' where they receive international pay rates, but economic hardship remains severe. The country's economic crisis led to over 500,000 job losses in 2022, with many living below the poverty line. Consequently, an all-time high of nearly 900,000 Sri Lankans sought passports last year to seek better opportunities abroad.

The article argues that veterans are not being scammed but are making informed choices due to economic desperation caused by misguided political leadership. They seek better livelihoods abroad, even at personal risk, driven by insufficient wages and a lack of opportunities at home.
