High performers are essential to a team’s success, often producing significantly more output than their peers. But research shows that they often receive lower-quality feedback. Managers tend to focus on lower performers, neglecting the development needs of high performers. High performers tend to thrive on feedback and are motivated by it. To engage and retain high performers, managers should provide constructive feedback, highlighting areas of growth. It is advisable to avoid exaggerated or fixed-mindset language, which can be demotivating. When giving feedback, focus on skills and behaviors instead of personality traits. Moreover, be mindful of reinforcing negative stereotypes, which can affect underrepresented groups more profoundly. Finally, map out clear paths for growth, offering specific guidance on how high performers can advance.
