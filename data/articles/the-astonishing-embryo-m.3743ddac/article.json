    "When the Palestinian stem-cell scientist Jacob Hanna was stopped while entering the US last May, airport customs agents took him aside and held him for hours in \u201csecondary,\u201d a back office where you don\u2019t have your passport and can\u2019t use your phone. There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,\u201d he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey said, \u2018You have the right to refuse,\u2019\u201d he recalls, \u201cand I said, \u2018No, no, it\u2019s an open book.\u2019\u201d  Related StoryThis researcher wants to replace your brain, little by littleRead next The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel\u2019s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works\u2014Israel\u2019s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad. Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents\u2019 questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.  Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn\u2019t have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That\u2019s because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don\u2019t involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization.\u00a0 Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo\u2014a feat that\u2019s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine. Advertisement  Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo\u2014the kind with legal protections\u2014and one conjured from stem cells.  In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he\u2019d used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds\u2014growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta.\u00a0 These sorts of models aren\u2019t yet the same as embryos. It\u2019s rare that they form correctly\u2014it takes a hundred tries to make one\u2014and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna\u2019s creations are \u201centirely astonishing and very disturbing.\u201d Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo\u2014the kind with legal protections\u2014and one conjured from stem cells.",
    "Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that\u2019s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-\u00adprimitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they\u2019ve never grown before\u2014outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There\u2019s Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings.\u00a0  Jacob Hanna leads a team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, that is studying how to create embryos without using sperm, eggs, or fertilization. He\u2019s cofounded a startup company, Renewal Bio, that has plans to use these synthetic embryo models as bioprinters to produce youthful tissue, but ethical questions surround the project.AHMAD GHARABLI/GETTY IMAGES   Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, MIT Technology Review has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.",
    "Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it\u2019s possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they\u2019d reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment. But even if he hasn\u2019t gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is \u201ctrying to make entities at more advanced stages\u2014depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,\u201d he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he\u2019d traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory\u2019s annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy.\u00a0 Related StoryAfter 25 years of hype, embryonic stem cells are still waiting for their momentRead next O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I\u2019d heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won\u2019t sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. \u201cIf you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you\u2019d get people\u2019s attention,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be like, whoa\u2014what are we doing?\u201d Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna\u2019s plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there\u2019s no brain, Hanna\u2019s reasoning goes, there\u2019s no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs. Snead says that\u2019s not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. \u201cWhat is considered human? Who is considered human?\u201d wonders Snead. \u201cIt\u2019s who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.\u201d The beginnings of bodies Each of us\u2014me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna\u2014started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that\u2019s able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization\u2014and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants.",
    "Advertisement A side-by-side comparison of synthetic (left) and natural (right) mouse embryos shows similar formation of the brain and heart.AMADEI AND HANDFORD/UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE   But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. \u201cThe sad truth is that over 25 years that we\u2019ve been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,\u201d says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, \u201cwe\u2019ve got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.\u201d The body\u2019s most potent blood-forming cells in particular \u201cnever appear,\u201d according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.  Hanna\u2019s startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of \u201cbioprinter,\u201d producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.  It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities\u2014some of which resembled parts of an embryo.\u00a0 Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a \u201cbona fide\u201d human embryo model that was \u201cfully integrated,\u201d with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing.\u00a0 His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of \u201cbioprinter,\u201d producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient\u2019s DNA. And that\u2019s possible too: These days reprogramming anyone\u2019s skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos.",
    "Hanna\u2019s research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can\u2019t be published and what terminology to use. That\u2019s to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators.\u00a0 The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere \u201cmodels.\u201d According to a statement it fired off in 2023, \u201cembryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos\u201d\u2014and, it added, they \u201ccannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.\u201d\u00a0 Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d\u00a0 Replacement parts Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn\u2019t going away. Instead, there are signals it\u2019s getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by MIT Technology Review, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called \u201cbodyoids,\u201d arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an \u201cunlimited source\u201d of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him \u201csome creeps,\u201d he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and \u201csoon.\u201d",
    "Related StoryEthically sourced \u201cspare\u201d human bodies could revolutionize medicineRead next Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another \u201cbodyoids\u201d author, said the editorial provided a surprise entr\u00e9e for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part \u201creplacement.\u201d He met the CEO of Hanna\u2019s company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island \u201cjust like Jurassic Park,\u201d Nakauchi says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These sorts of plans\u2014real or rumored\u2014have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of \u201ccommercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro\u201d and bringing it to viability inside \u201cartificial systems.\u201d Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models \u201ccannot and will not\u201d develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability \u201cunsafe and unethical,\u201d placing them in a \u201cprohibited\u201d category. It added that the ban would cover \u201cany purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Blurred boundaries Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That\u2019s still science fiction. But there\u2019s a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that\u2019s what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way\u2014say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes.\u00a0 Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don\u2019t start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won\u2019t cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references \u201ca human pregnancy\u201d and a \u201cuterus\u201d\u2014and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel.\u00a0 Related StoryScientists are trying to get cows pregnant with synthetic embryosRead next Another policy under pressure is the \u201c14-day rule,\u201d a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it\u2019s a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it\u2019s been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn\u2019t being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn\u2019t define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that\u2019s a critical loophole. If the structures aren\u2019t considered true embryos, then the rule doesn\u2019t apply. \u00a0 Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a \u201cgrey area\u201d and said it \u201chas left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.\u201d",
    "Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling\u2014even to scientists. \u201cI was scared, honestly,\u201d Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the Guardian in 2023. \u201cI had to look down and look back again.\u201d\u00a0 That particular stem-cell model isn\u2019t complete\u2014it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it\u2019s not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don\u2019t count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a \u201cfool\u2019s paradox\u201d and a \u201crather unstable situation.\u201d",
    "Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it\u2019s just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are \u201cmorally significant\u201d human features\u2014like hands or a face\u2014that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. \u201cI personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,\u201d says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida.\u00a0  \u201cI always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal \u2026 Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.\u201d Jacob Hanna Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. \u201cI\u2019m almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,\u201d he says. \u201cThings can shift very quickly for political reasons.\u201d\u00a0 And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He\u2019s gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal. What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities\u2014all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. \u201cIt was unofficial. I didn\u2019t have to get a permit from him,\u201d Hanna says. \u201cBut \u2026 what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cI really do think it\u2019s admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he\u2019s doing. I think that makes him different,\u201d says Snead. \u201cBut if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.\u201d Perhaps, Snead says, it\u2019s a way to market the structures as the \u201cgreen, sustainable alternative to embryos.\u201d A heartbeat in a jar To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher \u201cheads above the rest,\u201d according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University\u2019s medical school. \u201cHe\u2019s very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Adashi says. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.\u201d Related StoryScientists plan to drop the 14-day embryo rule, a key limit on stem cell researchRead next While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel\u2019s ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background\u2014he\u2019s from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab. Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna\u2019s team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna\u2019s students scrambling to save research.",
    "Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna\u2019s ideas and technologies are being exported\u2014and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna\u2019s former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells. During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted\u2014a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat.\u00a0 That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar\u2014it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don\u2019t grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn\u2019t just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There\u2019s probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren\u2019t entirely normal\u2014not yet true embryos.  A rotating bioreactor, developed in Israel, is used to grow synthetic embryos in small jars of blood serum.GETTY IMAGES   Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna\u2019s research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it\u2019s inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs\u2014closer to \u201chuevos fritos\u201d than real embryos, he says. \u201cI do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,\u201d he adds.  In Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n\u2019s view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment\u2014and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered \u201cmere water\u201d until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. \u201cSome people aren\u2019t allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can\u2019t,\u201d says Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n. \u201cJacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible\u2014that is his aim. He\u2019s very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don\u2019t dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.\u201d\u00a0 The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they\u2019re inside the womb\u2014and at four or five weeks, many people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they\u2019re still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,\u201d says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor.\u00a0 Advertisement What\u2019s more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly\u2014just as a real one does\u2014and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied\u2014and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it.\u00a0 Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can\u2019t find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue?\u00a0 In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks \u201cthere is still no personification of the embryo\u201d and it\u2019s permissible to use them in research. Young everything Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup\u2019s idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls \u201cperfect cells\u201d for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain \u201cyoung, genetically identical everything.\u201d Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. \u201cWe even went to CVS,\u201d he said, \u201cand by day eight it\u2019s already triggering a pregnancy test. So it\u2019s alive.\u201d \u00a0 Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose Commonwealth series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he\u2019s pitched Hanna\u2019s technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna\u2019s work is \u201cmagic\u201d that\u2019s sure to win a Nobel.   \u201cThe importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.\u201d Carsten Charlesworth, researcher, Stanford University But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can\u2019t support them any longer. That\u2019s because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn\u2019t easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. \u201cNo one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?\u201d Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park. The solution, so far, is a neural knockout\u2014genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don\u2019t develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won\u2019t live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. \u201cWe got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,\u201d Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. \u201cIt\u2019s just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.\u201d\u00a0 The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research\u2014suggesting that it\u2019s no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi\u2019s team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. \u201cThe importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,\u201d says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi\u2019s lab. He says the group is working toward a \u201cgenetic software package\u201d it can add to mouse embryos to create a \u201creproducible phenotype.\u201d  It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that\u2019s part of a broader trend toward what he calls \u201clife that is not life,\u201d which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms \u201cdisenhancement\u201d and \u201cdisengineering.\u201d That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production.\u00a0 Advertisement For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement\u2014creating a baby with advantages. It\u2019s much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna\u2019s plans remind him of Bokanovsky\u2019s Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel Brave New World.

Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias\u2014Jurassic Park, Gattaca\u2014seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There\u2019s Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrej\u00f3n says he\u2019s already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston \u200bearlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman. Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will\u00a0 form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries\u2014her ovaries, really, not anyone else\u2019s\u2014could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible. During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was \u201csources of moral authority.\u201d Hanna\u2019s authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what\u2019s in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we\u2019re sitting here and we\u2019re discussing human dignity, we\u2019re discussing the status of an embryo, and we\u2019re discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?\u201d"
