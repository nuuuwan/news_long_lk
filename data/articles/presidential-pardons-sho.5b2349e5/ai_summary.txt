Facts:
- On June 6, the Supreme Court reversed the Presidential pardon of Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, who had been sentenced to death over a 2005 murder. This is the second reversal by the court in six months of such a pardon.
- Gotabaya Rajapaksa's clemency for Duminda Silva was overturned by the court on January 17; Silva was also on death row for a 2011 murder.
- The quashings of both pardons resulted from the Presidents not following the correct legal procedures.
- President Ranil Wickremesinghe did not grant amnesty to Galagodaaththe Gnanasara, sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment in March. His pardon by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2019 for contempt of court is still being legally challenged. 
- A case against Army Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake, sentenced to death in 2017 and pardoned by Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2020, remains pending.  
- Most pardons granted by various Presidents in the past were largely rejected by the public due to the perception they were based on political or communal grounds.

Opinions:
- Presidential pardons have been used to undermined the role of the judiciary according to Ahalya Lelwala, a Research Assistant at Verit√© Research.
- Lelwala also suggests that it could be deemed appropriate to grant a pardon if the convict is unable to afford an appeal, or where there appears to be a miscarriage of justice due to political or personal vendetta.
- No protests were raised when injustices against former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake were addressed by President Sirisena through pardons, an illustration of public acceptance of pardons in specific circumstances.
- Many leaders in Sri Lanka are so corrupt that they misuse their power to pardon criminals, according to the article.
- The Commission hired by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to invalidate court actions against his allies demonstrates the misuse of presidential power.
