# What new hydropower tech says about climate action

## Summary 🤖

🦈💡Natel Energy is developing hydropower turbines that are safer for fish as part of an effort to balance climate action with freshwater ecosystems. 
🎤🧪Co-founder Gia Schneider presented this mission at the 2022 ClimateTech event and showed images of the effect of conventional turbines on fish.
🌊💨Hydropower is the top source of renewable electricity globally, acting as a balancing factor for the grid by storing energy that can adjust to meet demand.
🏞️🚨Hydropower, however, can significantly impact the environment, contributing to a drop in migratory freshwater fish populations by over 80% since 1970. 
♻️🐟Natel's turbines are designed to be safer for fish with specially-curved blades that push water ahead, forming an "airbag for fish". 
⏳💼Many hydropower plants are due for renewal from regulators soon, offering a timely opportunity to implement safer technology. 
🔄🌳Choosing whether to replace old turbines with environmentally damaging ones or upgrade to more eco-friendly models is a concern.
⛏️☀️Other sectors also face challenges balancing climate intervention and biodiversity preservation, such as in mining for essential metals for renewable infrastructure and siting solar panels to avoid harm to local wildlife.
⚖️🌏Projects should carefully balance local ecosystem and community needs with global emission targets as climate change affects all life forms.

This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. For nearly two years, I’ve been thinking about a set of photos of fish I saw at a conference.  Related StoryHow fish-safe hydropower technology could keep more renewables on the gridNatel Energy is trying to design turbines that are safer for fish passing through.

The presentation was from our ClimateTech event in 2022, when we invited scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in fields from fusion energy to agriculture to talk about their work. Gia Schneider, a cofounder of Natel Energy, was speaking about her company’s mission to design hydropower turbines that are safer for fish.  She showed images of fish that had been hit by conventional turbine blades, and let me tell you, it wasn’t good. When the fish hit those fast-moving pieces of metal, they quickly became … not exactly fish-shaped anymore. On the other hand, the fish swimming through Natel’s turbines seemed hardly bothered, curving around the blades and going on their merry way downstream.

Recently, I finally got the chance to chat with Schneider about how Natel is working to change hydropower technology and juggle climate action with freshwater ecosystems. Read all about it in my latest story, and in the meantime, here’s why I’ve been so obsessed with fish and hydropower tech.   Hydropower is the world’s leading source of renewable electricity. It often plays a crucial role balancing the grid, since hydroelectric plants with dams can store energy and be ramped up and down to help meet demand. When hydropower production goes down, as it did last year when droughts struck the western US, emissions go up.

But hydropower can also have a whole range of negative effects on the environment. Dams have contributed to a collapse in populations of migratory freshwater fish, which are down by more than 80% since 1970. (Mining and water diversion also play a role here, so we can’t entirely blame hydropower or even dams used for other purposes.)  Natel is attempting to make hydropower a bit more fish-friendly. Its turbines are curved in a different way and feature blunter edges that push water out in front of them, creating something of an “airbag for fish,” as Schneider puts it. That helps more fish pass through the power plants safely. Now is a great time to reconsider the technology we use in hydropower plants, Schneider explains, because the fleet is aging, and many plants are due for recommissioning from regulators in the next decade or so.   Related StoryEmissions hit a record high in 2023. Blame hydropower.Droughts led to a drop in generation from hydroelectric plants, and fossil fuels filled the gap.

As she sees it, the question facing utilities is: “Are we going to replace it with what we have used in the past, which we know has a negative impact on the environment? Or can we find ways to upgrade and modernize the fleet so that we can get another four or five decades of good operation out of it, but do so in a way that materially improves the environmental performance?”  We can draw parallels with so many other situations where efforts to address climate change can challenge and clash with work to preserve biodiversity and the environment.  Take mining. We need lithium and a whole host of other metals to build the infrastructure to power the world with renewables and other low-emission power sources. But figuring out where to get those metals and how to get local communities on board can be a challenge, as my colleague James Temple covered in a set of stories last year looking at one proposed lithium mine in Minnesota.  And while solar panels have become a major source of low-emission power across the western US, new projects have sometimes met pushback because of concerns about how they’ll affect local wildlife in the grassland and desert ecosystems there. Biologists are especially concerned about animals like pronghorns. Populations of the antelope-like creatures are a fraction of what they used to be, and development could fracture their habitat even further.  It can be difficult to balance the needs of local ecosystems and communities with the need to make global progress on our emissions goals. The trade-offs might look different for every project and every ecosystem, but new projects need to take this balance seriously, because climate change affects all of us—including the fish.
