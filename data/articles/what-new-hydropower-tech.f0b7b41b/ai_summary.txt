🦈💡Natel Energy is developing hydropower turbines that are safer for fish as part of an effort to balance climate action with freshwater ecosystems. 
🎤🧪Co-founder Gia Schneider presented this mission at the 2022 ClimateTech event and showed images of the effect of conventional turbines on fish.
🌊💨Hydropower is the top source of renewable electricity globally, acting as a balancing factor for the grid by storing energy that can adjust to meet demand.
🏞️🚨Hydropower, however, can significantly impact the environment, contributing to a drop in migratory freshwater fish populations by over 80% since 1970. 
♻️🐟Natel's turbines are designed to be safer for fish with specially-curved blades that push water ahead, forming an "airbag for fish". 
⏳💼Many hydropower plants are due for renewal from regulators soon, offering a timely opportunity to implement safer technology. 
🔄🌳Choosing whether to replace old turbines with environmentally damaging ones or upgrade to more eco-friendly models is a concern.
⛏️☀️Other sectors also face challenges balancing climate intervention and biodiversity preservation, such as in mining for essential metals for renewable infrastructure and siting solar panels to avoid harm to local wildlife.
⚖️🌏Projects should carefully balance local ecosystem and community needs with global emission targets as climate change affects all life forms.
