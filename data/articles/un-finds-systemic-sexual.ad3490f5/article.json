    "The UN Human Rights Council set up the Sri Lanka Accountability Project in 2021 to collect evidence of crimes under international law committed in Sri Lanka. Successive Sri Lankan Governments have failed to credibly investigate and prosecute international crimes related to the 26-year civil war between Government forces and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The current Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to office in 2024 promising to \u201cdeliver justice\u201d but has made no apparent progress, while victims and survivors continue to suffer long-term harm",
    "Human Rights Watch says impunity prevails for abuses against women, men; survivors suffer for years",
    "A new United Nations report about sexual violence related to Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war is another step forward in the struggle for accountability for crimes under international law that were committed in Sri Lanka, Human Rights Watch said last week.",
    "The UN report, issued on January 13, 2025, finds that sexual violence was \u201cpart of a deliberate, widespread, and systemic pattern of violations\u201d by state security forces, and \u201cmay amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d",
    "The findings, based on survivors\u2019 accounts of crimes committed against both women and men, underline the urgent need for the Sri Lankan Government to provide relief and justice to survivors and to hold those responsible to account. Foreign Governments should assist efforts to promote accountability, including through targeted sanctions, criminal investigations, and prosecutions, Human Rights Watch said.",
    "\u201cWhile the appalling rape and murder of Tamil women by Sri Lankan soldiers at the war\u2019s end has long been known, the UN report shows that systematic sexual abuse was ignored, concealed, and even justified by Sri Lankan Governments unwilling to punish those responsible,\u201d said Human Rights Watch Asia Deputy Director Meenakshi Ganguly. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s international partners need to step up their efforts to promote accountability for war crimes in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "The UN Human Rights Council set up the Sri Lanka Accountability Project in 2021 to collect evidence of crimes under international law committed in Sri Lanka. Successive Sri Lankan Governments have failed to credibly investigate and prosecute international crimes related to the 26-year civil war between Government forces and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).",
    "The current Government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to office in 2024 promising to \u201cdeliver justice\u201d but has made no apparent progress, while victims and survivors continue to suffer long-term harm. Under international women\u2019s rights standards, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the UN Women, Peace and Security agenda, Sri Lanka\u2019s failure to address conflict-related sexual violence heightens concerns about accountability and survivors\u2019 rights.",
    "During the armed conflict, which ended on May 18, 2009, both sides committed numerous war crimes, particularly in the final months of the fighting. Photographs and mobile phone videos, seemingly made as keepsakes by Government soldiers, show summary executions of prisoners and corpses of naked women fighters who were apparently raped and then murdered. Human Rights Watch has found that successive Sri Lankan Governments had stalled investigations and denied justice.",
    "The UN researchers found that sexual violence was \u201cinstitutionally enabled\u201d by the state and \u201cemployed as a strategic tool to extract information, assert dominance, intimidate individuals and communities, and instill a pervasive climate of fear and humiliation\u201d throughout the war. The victims and survivors were mostly from conflict-affected Tamil communities, and these violations occurred primarily in state-run detention facilities.",
    "Survivors recounted lasting medical problems and social stigma. However, the researchers said that there is \u201cno currently visible path to justice or restoration\u201d for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence in Sri Lanka.",
    "The UN researchers found that \u201cmen were as likely as women to have been victims\u201d of sexual violence, but that the particular stigma affecting male survivors made engaging them during the research \u201cespecially challenging.\u201d",
    "Another legacy of these crimes is the prevalence of sexual violence in post-conflict Sri Lanka, the researchers found. Survivors described an enduring climate of intimidation and \u201congoing surveillance, often by the very officers responsible for past abuse.\u201d",
    "There are significant legal and institutional obstacles to justice, including a 20-year statute of limitations in sexual violence cases and the fact that Sri Lankan law does not recognise the rape of men. Some survivors who attempted to register complaints described humiliating or intimidating experiences with the police and court authorities. \u201cSurvivors cannot be expected to seek protection from the very entity they fear,\u201d one respondent told the UN.",
    "In 2018, the Sri Lankan Government established the Office for Reparations Act to compensate victims and survivors of the conflict, but according to the UN, the Government \u201chas not taken any concrete steps to provide them with interim or full reparations, and has not disaggregated statistics of its caseload by gender.\u201d Under international law, survivors have a right to reparations, and the failure to provide them has left many without care, dignity, or justice.",
    "The Sri Lankan Government and its international partners should urgently develop a program to deliver support, including medical treatment, and interim relief to survivors, Human Rights Watch said. Many survivors have placed their hope in foreign Governments or international organisations to promote justice. Yet, the report says: \u201cWhile international actors have expressed concern, meaningful steps toward facilitating credible accountability and access to justice for survivors have remained limited.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is obligated under international law to prosecute perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and until it does, foreign Governments need to do more to press for accountability,\u201d Ganguly said. \u201cThat means providing support for legal processes, better vetting of military personnel for peacekeeping missions, and concerted efforts to bring criminal cases abroad under universal jurisdiction.\u201d"
