Devastating cricket fans across the country, South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets at the T20 World Cup, on Monday (3).

It may be a cliche in the scorebook, but a famous saying lasts a lifetime. It goes like this: ‚ÄúFor when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, He writes, not that you won or lost, but how you played the Game.‚Äù Though often quoted, Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs poem ‚ÄòIf‚Äô also applies to what we learn and what we should become through sports. Kipling‚Äôs poem goes like this:

If you can keep your head when all about you

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

If you can trust yourself when all people

But make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being lied about, don‚Äôt deal in lies,

Or being hated, don‚Äôt give way to hating,

And yet don‚Äôt look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream‚Äîand not make dreams your master;

If you can think‚Äîand not make thoughts

If you can meet with triumph and disaster

And treat those two impostors just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you‚Äôve spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

And stoop and build ‚Äôem up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: ‚ÄòHold on!‚Äô

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

Or walk with Kings‚Äînor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all people count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds‚Äô worth of distance run,

Yours is the Earth and everything that‚Äôs in it,

And‚Äîwhich is more‚Äîyou‚Äôll be a human,

(The poem has been edited to make it gender friendly)

In Sri Lanka, cricket is not only popular but an obsession among the people especially after the versatile Arjuna Ranatunga led us to victory in the world cup of 1996.

Kerry Packer is the man responsible for World Series Cricket and the explosion of the one-day game. Packer, a media mogul billionaire, was behind the damaging split from the Australian Cricket Board in the late 1970s in a fight over television broadcasting rights, and when peace was achieved, his Channel 9 coverage led the way in innovation.

Before the enterprising, Packer‚Äôs intervention 5 day test matches were the focal point in cricket with the ‚ÄòAshes‚Äô series between England and Australia being the key event. That era also produced some great knights including Sir Donald Bradman and Sir Leonard Hutton, while in the bowling field legends like Frank Tyson and Harold Larwood, while in recent times there was a thunderbolt of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson.

According to the United Nations, the international day for sports and development and Peace (IDSDP), which takes place annually presents an opportunity to recognize the positive role sport and physical activity play in communities and in people‚Äôs lives across the globe.
