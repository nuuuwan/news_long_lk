South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets at the T20 World Cup. The defeat has disappointed cricket fans in Sri Lanka. The story goes on to underscore the importance of how the game is played and not simply about winning or losing, referencing Rudyard Kipling's poem 'If'. Cricket is noted as a significant obsession among the Sri Lankan population, with Arjuna Ranatunga's World Cup victory in 1996 being a particularly proud moment. Kerry Packer is recognized for his role in evolving cricket and helping it reach a wider audience through his media channels.
