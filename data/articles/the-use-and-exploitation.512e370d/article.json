    "Voters mainly elderly citizens at a polling booth. (File Photo)",
    "Senior citizens also play a pivotal role in shaping electoral outcomes. In recent presidential elections approximately 2.7 million citizens over the age of 60 were eligible to vote",
    "As the upcoming general election approaches, we should ensure that it doesn\u2019t become yet another arena where senior citizens are exploited for\u00a0political gain",
    "On a global scale, there is increasing advocacy for a UN Convention on the Rights of Older Persons",
    "As I went through countless election campaign videos and scrolled through dozens of photos of canvassing something stood out. Senior citizens were always in the front lines of these efforts. But were they truly there out of choice? Were promises of financial rewards, or even just a pack of rice, dangled in front of them to secure their participation? Was hunger the key tool to drag our seniors to these meetings? Did they understand what was written on the placards they were holding? Was alcohol used as bait to gather unemployed elderly men for pocket meetings?",
    "The recent election campaign raises serious questions about whether it was one of the worst examples of mass exploitation of senior citizens\u2019 rights.",
    "Election monitoring bodies, alongside civil society, must take an active role in safeguarding the rights of elderly voters. This could involve stricter oversight, better education on their electoral rights and establishing dedicated support groups to assist seniors throughout the campaign period",
    "Constant manipulation for political gain could lead to feelings of helplessness, mistrust and alienation",
    "Sri Lanka prides itself on strict election campaign monitoring, but there seems to be no clear method for ensuring the protection of elderly voters and their rights.",
    "Rights of the senior citizens",
    "As a state-sector rheumatologist I interact with senior citizens daily and recognise their unique needs. The National Policy for Senior Citizens of Sri Lanka adopted in 2016 outlines their right to access adequate food, shelter and clothing through social security. It also emphasises the importance of creating safe and adaptable living environments for them. While we observe the International Day of Older Persons on October 1 each year the reality remains that many seniors face neglect in meeting their basic needs.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s life expectancy has risen significantly from 43 years in 1946 to 76 years in 2021. Despite this increase there are very few initiatives to support the elderly in their later years. Older adults over the age of 70 with a monthly income below 3000 rupees receive a mere 2000 rupee allowance which does little to alleviate the challenges of living in a time of high inflation.",
    "Local research showing troubling results",
    "In research conducted among elderly patients in 2022 we quantified the financial burden in the backdrop of an economic crises. These senior citizens had to frequently cut down spending for food or clothes (observed in 31.5% of the participants) and expenses in general (seen in 50.7%). Another breakthrough finding was a correlation between worry over one\u2019s own financial issues due to disease which and worry on current countrywide economic situation, negative social and emotional functioning.",
    "The role of senior citizens in shaping electoral outcomes",
    "Senior citizens also play a pivotal role in shaping electoral outcomes. In recent presidential elections approximately 2.7 million citizens over the age of 60 were eligible to vote. However there are justified concerns about whether they are being specifically targeted due to their loyalty to particular political ideologies or because they are more vulnerable to manipulation.",
    "Exploitation and the psychological impact",
    "Constant manipulation for political gain could lead to feelings of helplessness, mistrust and alienation among seniors. They will be forced to enter campaigns lured on the hope of short-term rewards such as food or financial aid. Which they know will cease to exist once the election ends. This exploitation when it preys on basic needs like hunger can leave seniors with long lasting resentment.",
    "On a global scale, there is increasing advocacy for a UN Convention on the Rights of Older Persons. Led by groups such as the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older People (GAROP) these initiatives call for protection against age-based discrimination and exploitation including in political processes. The focus is on ensuring that older adults are not passive participants, but active contributors to decision-making in their communities.",
    "There must be an open and transparent debate on the ethical responsibilities of political parties when engaging with vulnerable populations like senior citizens. Clear regulations should be implemented to restrict exploitative campaign practices, such as offering food, financial incentives or alcohol to seniors as these tactics often prey on their vulnerabilities.",
    "Election monitoring bodies, alongside civil society, must take an active role in safeguarding the rights of elderly voters. This could involve stricter oversight, better education on their electoral rights and establishing dedicated support groups to assist seniors throughout the campaign period. As the upcoming general election approaches, we should ensure that it doesn\u2019t become yet another arena where senior citizens are exploited for political gain.",
