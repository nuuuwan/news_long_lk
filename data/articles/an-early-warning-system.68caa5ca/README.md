The fragility of supply chains has been evident as companies have faced a series of shocks in recent years. Many companies have taken actions to improve their resilience, including building inventory buffers, dual-sourcing, and re-shoring. Even so, fewer than...more

Not many executives need to be told that supply chains are fragile. For those who could use reminding, when the Suez Canal was unsettled last year, the number of ships passing through dropped by two-thirds. The ripple effects, such as higher prices and shortages for products ranging from toys to aircraft, were felt all over the globe.

For the sake of efficiency, supply chains have become incredibly complicated. In that complexity are the seeds of a vulnerability that can undermine efficiency in times of trouble. These are not theoretical issues. McKinsey research has found that, on average, supply-chain shocks will lead to losses equal to almost 45% of a company’s full-year profits over the course of a decade. The only way to cope is to be resilient.

Not surprisingly, then, many companies have taken actions to improve their resilience, including building inventory buffers, dual-sourcing, and re-shoring. Even so, fewer than a third of leaders surveyed in 2023 said their companies were fully prepared for a disruption; a quarter admitted to being underprepared.

There is, however, a proven, practical way to do better: installing an early warning system (EWS). Like an emergency light in a car, a well-designed EWS can alert companies to small problems before they become big ones. One company we worked with that implemented an EWS reduced its parts shortages by 70% in six months. And a manufacturer we worked with that used an EWS reported a 40% reduction in quality defects in the first year.

Here’s how to get started.

1. Create an integrated and centralized data-storage system.

Often known as a “data lake,” this enterprise-wide repository contains both quantitative data — operational, financial, and business process metrics from engineering, operations, contracts, finance, and production — and qualitative data, such as supplier site visit reports. Because the point of an EWS is to scan for risks, which can come from anywhere, the more information that drains into the data lake, the better. A site visit, for example, can reveal if a crucial employee has left or if inventory has spiked; no individual metric can capture such field-level insights. Finally, external information, such as raw material inventories, shipping congestion, and cash on hand, can also be included.

Establishing a data lake with exhaustive, detailed, and reliable information from across the entire value stream is ideal, but far from straightforward. Data sources may have different formats and standards, and there may be issues related to governance and accessibility. One automotive company that started to build a data lake took more than a year to scrub the data and achieve usable results.

For these reasons and more, companies may find it useful to start with a smaller set of data that is relevant, of high quality, and can be regularly updated. Such data is usually available in core operating systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), quality management systems (QMS), and manufacturing execution systems (MES).

2. Apply artificial intelligence (AI) to convert data into actionable alarms.

The point of collecting data is to set off an alarm, while separating the signal from the noise. One way to do so is to use AI to detect anomalies.

When an automotive manufacturer used AI to track the number of late daily deliveries, it observed that when there was a surge in delays, a different problem, such as quality defects, was more likely to follow. This insight led the carmaker to focus early on delivery issues, even when the absolute numbers were inconsequential.

In another case, an aerospace manufacturer used AI to compare suppliers to others with similar raw materials and production processes. A noticeable deviation in areas such as inventory, planning changes, late orders, or logistics congestion alerted the manufacturer to possible trouble down the line.

It’s important that such alarms are specific, along the lines of “There is a high risk that supplier X will face shortages of part Y.” Otherwise, companies will waste time hunting the problem. The aerospace manufacturer’s EWS featured 12 different alarms, with a false-positive rate of less than 15%.

3. Rewrite and activate the risk-management playbook.

Once the alarm rings, there needs to be clear and well-understood response processes.

Many existing playbooks use a traffic-light system, with “red” noting suppliers with the highest risk. Essentially, this is a form of classification. That is useful but insufficient, leaving organizations vulnerable to issues that can escalate from minor disruptions to major challenges.

An EWS, by contrast, prompts action. It sets out a standard way to identify where the alarm is coming from, what is to be done, by whom, and in what order. By embedding the EWS in work instructions and by providing formal training, leading organizations ensure that frontline supply chain, procurement, and quality teams have the authority, and the capabilities, to act.

To build resilience and expertise, every alarm should be answered — fast. Investigating an alarm may be as simple as calling the supplier for clarification. Other times, it may require visiting the site.

Once the nature of the alarm is known, mitigating the risk is next. Actions could include working with a supplier to find a new source for raw materials; relaxing engineering constraints to improve part manufacturability; redesigning the product; or finding a new supplier.

Supply chains will inevitably face disruption again. And again. Because no one can guess the future with accuracy, adaptability will always be essential. An EWS can help sense the signs of a looming crisis — the necessary first step to resilience.
