    "Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn\u2019t always easy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created the AI Hype Index\u2014a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.  AI agents are the AI industry\u2019s hypiest new product\u2014intelligent assistants capable of completing tasks without human supervision. But while they can be theoretically useful\u2014Simular AI\u2019s S2 agent, for example, intelligently switches between models depending on what it\u2019s been told to do\u2014they could also be weaponized to execute cyberattacks.

Oh, and if the results of the first half-marathon pitting humans against humanoid robots are anything to go by, we won\u2019t have to worry about the robot uprising any time soon. hide"
