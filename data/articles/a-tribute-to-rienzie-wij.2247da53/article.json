    "Capt. Navin De Silva with Rienzie T. Wijetilleke",
    "The occasion of generous donation toward the Wesley College Pavilion Project by Rienzie T. Wijetilleke",
    "By Capt. Navin De Silva",
    "My association with Rienzie Wijetilleke began early in my life, through the Old Wesleyites Sports Club and later the Old Boys\u2019 Union of Wesley College. He was much more than just an old boy \u2014 he was a mentor, a guide, and a true Wesleyite at heart.",
    "Wijetilleke served with distinction as President of the Old Boys\u2019 Union, leading with integrity and deep devotion to his alma mater. He was always present at meetings, events, and every important occasion. The way he carried himself and addressed challenges was a true example for us all.",
    "He helped many fellow old boys, especially in guiding them into the banking profession, and remained committed to Wesley till the very end. I remember clearly how, even in his final days, he invited a few of us, including the principal, to his home to make a generous donation toward the Pavilion Project a testament to his lifelong loyalty.",
    "During my own tenure as President of the Old Boys\u2019 Union, we held a special ceremony to honour all past presidents.\u00a0 Wijetilleke, though unwell, made the effort to attend. Though he couldn\u2019t step forward to collect his award, his presence meant everything to us.",
    "Mr.\u00a0 Wijetilleke, thank you for your leadership, your kindness, and your unwavering love for Wesley. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. Your legacy will remain in our hearts and within the proud history of Wesley College."
