With a vision for a cleaner and greener future, our youth entrepreneurs should take the lead in pioneering the adoption of eco-friendly technologies, renewable energy integration, and waste reduction strategies

A timely call for¬†young entrepreneurs

We are living in an era where nature pleadingly seeks human support for its survival and sustainability. Even though it is truly disheartening to see how actions caused by humans have paved the way toward the degradation of nature over the years, it is at least relieving to see that the world has now started to understand the gravity of this major problem. Since the spillover effects of these sustainability issues tend to pose a greater threat to the present as well as future generations, it is high time that the present youth understand the importance of being active as well as proactive in tackling this issue strategically.

At present, it is evident that a strong voice towards the importance of holistic focus on sustainable practices has been raised from a global level. The popular Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that we often hear in global as well as local forums are outcomes of such widely acknowledged efforts toward sustainability focus. Among these 17 goals announced by the United Nations, responsible production and consumption lie as the 12th goal. Aligning with the scope of the 12th SDG, this article attempts to uncover the role of new-generation entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka in supporting sustainable production, by focusing on green innovations.

In the rapidly advancing world, innovation goes beyond novel ideas; it now encompasses crafting fresh ideas that are environmentally sustainable. This movement is known as green innovation or eco-innovation. The essence lies in devising creative solutions that tackle challenges while leaving a minimal ecological footprint. Green innovations assist the decarbonisation efforts of the government and business firms in achieving net zero emissions.

Gone are the days when innovation was synonymous with progress at any cost. Green innovation is a game-changer, emphasising a balance between progress and the preservation of our planet. It urges the present generations to rethink the way they approach problems, ensuring that their solutions not only advance society but also safeguard precious natural resources and delicate ecosystems. It‚Äôs about rewriting the rules of innovation to ensure that growth and sustainability are not at odds but walk hand in hand, pushing us towards a more harmonious coexistence with our environment.

Green innovation in production

Green innovation in production methods embodies the adoption of eco-friendly and sustainable practices within manufacturing processes. The core objective is to mitigate any detrimental effects on our environment while optimising the use of resources and cutting down on waste. At its essence, it‚Äôs a call to revolutionise the way goods are produced. It‚Äôs about implementing processes that are gentle on our planet, ensuring a lighter ecological footprint is left behind. Its ultimate goal is to strike a balance between industrial needs and preserving the environment, finding a sustainable middle ground. In making this timely concept live in its meaning, a pivotal role can be possibly played by the young entrepreneurial blood of our country. As such, this time we are passing right now, is the opportune moment for young entrepreneurs to step into the forefront as catalysts for change, emphasising a strong commitment to innovating production methods that prioritise sustainability and environmental consciousness.

Few spotlights for greener youth entrepreneurial efforts

Shifting away from a linear ‚Äòtake-make-dispose‚Äô model

A focal point of attention by young entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, in making their production efforts sustainable could possibly be the concept of a circular economy. Embracing this approach means designing products with longevity in mind, enabling repair, reuse, and recycling at the end of their lifecycle. Instead of following a linear ‚Äòtake-make-dispose‚Äô model, the Sri Lankan youth could think of solidly shifting towards a circular approach, where materials are reused and regenerated, reducing waste and minimising the need for new resource extraction. By promoting durability, repairability, and repurposability, they will not only be able to contribute towards a greener Sri Lanka but also create a more sustainable and responsible production ecosystem in the country that supports the timely call for environmental stewardship. Readers may also explore cleaner production as the concepts and practices there can support green innovation thinking.

Exploit the lacuna in sustainable product packaging

Global FMCG giant, Unilever embarked on a project a few years ago to substantially reduce packaging that pollutes the environment. There is a visible gap in the focus directed toward sustainable packaging of products manufactured in Sri Lanka, leaving it a possible area to be exploited by young entrepreneurs. They can possibly emerge as pioneers in creating this transformative wave in sustainable packaging by taking steps to rethink and introduce novel ways of product packaging to the market. In this line, more attention could be possibly paid to not only device new mechanisms but also design ventures facilitating the creation of biodegradable, compostable, or reusable product packing innovations. By doing so, the young entrepreneurs will be able to challenge the status quo in the traditional product packaging solutions market in Sri Lanka and thereby propel a shift towards sustainable packaging practices, setting the stage for a cleaner and more eco-conscious future.

Ignite ventures central to recycling and waste reduction

In the Western world, ventures dedicated to recycling and waste reduction have become a common and acknowledged force in lessening the overall ecological impact of these nations. However, this environmentally conscious trend is noticeably less prevalent in Sri Lanka. The significance of this area has been somewhat overlooked in the country, presenting a golden opportunity for young entrepreneurs. By embracing and capitalising on this trend, they have the potential to create substantial positive impacts for both consumers and the production and manufacturing sectors in Sri Lanka. If young entrepreneurs proactively engage in this initiative, they may seek support from state authorities such as the Central Environmental Authority, National Research Council and similar entities committed to uplifting sustainable production practices in the country leading to a sustainable future.

Clearly a timely call

Given the impact entrepreneurs, in general, could pose towards the overall betterment of nations, it is important that Sri Lanka capitalises on its entrepreneurial strength for all possible aspects in making the country‚Äôs holistic performance better. Amidst the general discussions about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial efforts, the youth communities of any country hold prominence, as they symbolise the future. In an era where the whole world is striving towards attaining green targets, Sri Lanka too has to follow the trend. Aligning with the global momentum towards sustainability and environmentally conscious practices, leveraging the contributions of the youth is a critical necessity for any country. That is why, the green innovation focus has triumphed as a timely call for the Sri Lankan youth.

This is high time for the present young generations in Sri Lanka to emerge as influential catalysts for change in the realm of green innovation within production methods. These enterprising young minds should ideally strive to infuse new energy and ideas into traditional manufacturing practices, emphasising sustainability at every step. As such, with a vision for a cleaner and greener future, our youth entrepreneurs should take the lead in pioneering the adoption of eco-friendly technologies, renewable energy integration, and waste reduction strategies. Their active engagement in sustainable practices is crucial for a harmonious blend of economic growth and environmental stewardship, paving the way for a more sustainable industrial landscape. As such, isn‚Äôt it truly the right time for the Sri Lankan young entrepreneurs to set the stage for a paradigm shift in green production? Isn‚Äôt it truly a timely call for them to realign their focus much more towards green innovations? Readers who are keen in exploring green innovations and sustainability are invited to partner with the International Conference of Sustainable & Digital Business (ICSDB 2024) organised by the SLIIT Business School and to be held on 10 and 11 December.
