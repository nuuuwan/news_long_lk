1. 🗓️💪 The article discusses a research-based strategy on how to reshape goals over time, comparing them to soft clay that needs molding rather than to rocks. 
2. 🤔💭 Values form the basis of goals, and it's important to identify these underlying values. They are high-level goals that derive from personal beliefs and principles. 
3. 🎯🗂️ Success for each value needs to be defined clearly, even those hard to articulate. It suggests considering who you admire or envy to refine these definitions. 
4. 👥🔄 Definitions may vary from person to person; for example, two people who value family may understand it differently based on their personal experience and perspective. 
5. ⌛🕵️‍♀️ Evaluation of definitions of success is crucial. Determine whether they are imposed by external sources, fit your personality, or are appropriate for your current life stage. 
6. 🔄🔄 Terms of success can change over time; values can expand or retract according to your situation and need a regular reflection to align with your current circumstances. 
7. 💼👨‍👩‍👧 If you’re pursuing a particular career goal, for instance, you may need to adjust your value of being a parent, attending some of your kid’s games rather than coaching them all. 
8. 😉🔄 You can improve your definitions of success and shape your values to reduce conflict. Changing your definitions isn’t viewed as giving up, but rather as redefining your goals to make them more achievable. 
9. 🔄🏗️ The process of redefining success means having the flexibility to mold your goals based on your values, circumstances, and personality. 
10. 🧠🌈 Thinking of goals as moldable like clay provides the opportunity for change and flexibility rather than the rigidity of considering them as rocks.
