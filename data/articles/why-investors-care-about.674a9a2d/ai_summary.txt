1. 💬 MIT Technology Review covers Mike Schroepfer, former CTO of Meta and current climate tech investor, discussing funding aspects of climate tech solutions.
2. 🚀 Schroepfer stresses on investing in firms not just for their climate commitments, but their ability to deliver better, cheaper products that also have climate benefits. 
3. 🧠 The brilliance and creativity in the sector is evident but financial viability is crucial for survival. 
4. 📉 Reflecting on past failures, many tech ideas that emerged around 2006 collapsed by 2013 due to lack of financial advantages.
5. 👀 Startups must compete with established industries and face the challenge of the "green premium” — the cost difference between cheaper, polluting products and costlier, climate-friendly ones.
6. 💵 There are two main ways to tackle the green premium: increasing the cost of polluting products or reducing the cost of eco-friendly alternatives. While some policies aim for the former, it can make companies susceptible to political changes. 
7. 📊 Schroepfer asserts that new tech needs to become cheaper and can compete on economics or offer other customer benefits.
8. 🕒 The goal is to find companies that are able to compete in terms of cost over a five-to-10-year span. 
9. 💼 Long investment periods are sometimes required; solar panels and lithium-ion batteries took decades to become cheap and widespread. 
10. 🛒 Some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products, indicating the potential for technology like low-emissions steel to compete on cost by 2040-2050.
