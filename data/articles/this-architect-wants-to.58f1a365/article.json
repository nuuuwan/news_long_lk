    "Arnhildur P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir was around three years old when she saw a red sky from her living room window. A volcano was erupting about 25 miles away from where she lived on the northeastern coast of Iceland. Though it posed no immediate threat, its ominous presence seeped into her subconscious, populating her dreams with streaks of light in the night sky. Fifty years later, these \u201cgloomy, strange dreams,\u201d as P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir now describes them, have led to a career as an architect with an extraordinary mission: to harness molten lava and build cities out of it.  P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir today lives in Reykjavik, where she runs her own architecture studio, S.AP Arkitektar, and the Icelandic branch of the Danish architecture company Lendager, which specializes in reusing building materials. The architect believes the lava that flows from a single eruption could yield enough building material to lay the foundations of an entire city. She has been researching this possibility for more than five years as part of a project she calls Lavaforming. Together with her son and colleague Arnar Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson, she has identified three potential techniques: drill straight into magma pockets and extract the lava; channel molten lava into pre-dug trenches that could form a city\u2019s foundations; or 3D-print bricks from molten lava in a technique similar to the way objects can be printed out of molten glass.",
    "P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir and Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson first presented the concept during a talk at Reykjavik\u2019s DesignMarch festival in 2022. This year they are producing a speculative film set in 2150, in an imaginary city called Eldborg. Their film, titled Lavaforming, follows the lives of Eldborg\u2019s residents and looks back on how they learned to use molten lava as a building material. It will be presented at the Venice Biennale, a leading architecture festival, in May.\u00a0  Set in 2150, her speculative film Lavaforming presents a fictional city built from molten lava.COURTESY OF S.AP ARKITEKTAR   Buildings and construction materials like concrete and steel currently contribute a staggering 37% of the world\u2019s annual carbon dioxide emissions. Many architects are advocating for the use of natural or preexisting materials, but mixing earth and water into a mold is one thing; tinkering with 2,000 \u00b0F lava is another.",
    "Still, P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir is piggybacking on research already being done in Iceland, which has 30 active volcanoes. Since 2021, eruptions have intensified in the Reykjanes Peninsula, which is close to the capital and to tourist hot spots like the Blue Lagoon. In 2024 alone, there were six volcanic eruptions in that area. This frequency has given volcanologists opportunities to study how lava behaves after a volcano erupts. \u201cWe try to follow this beast,\u201d says Gro Birkefeldt M. Pedersen, a volcanologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO), who has consulted with P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir on a few occasions. \u201cThere is so much going on, and we\u2019re just trying to catch up and be prepared.\u201d P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir\u2019s concept assumes that many years from now, volcanologists will be able to forecast lava flow accurately enough for cities to plan on using it in building. They will know when and where to dig trenches so that when a volcano erupts, the lava will flow into them and solidify into either walls or foundations. Today, forecasting lava flows is a complex science that requires remote sensing technology and tremendous amounts of computational power to run simulations on supercomputers. The IMO typically runs two simulations for every new eruption\u2014one based on data from previous eruptions, and another based on additional data acquired shortly after the eruption (from various sources like specially outfitted planes). With every event, the team accumulates more data, which makes the simulations of lava flow more accurate. Pedersen says there is much research yet to be done, but she expects \u201ca lot of advancement\u201d in the next 10 years or so.\u00a0 To design the speculative city of Eldborg for their film, P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir and Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson used 3D-modeling software similar to what Pedersen uses for her simulations. The city is primarily built on a network of trenches that were filled with lava over the course of several eruptions, while buildings are constructed out of lava bricks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let nature design the buildings that will pop up,\u201d says P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir.\u00a0  The aesthetic of the city they envision will be less modernist and more fantastical\u2014a bit \u201clike [Gaudi\u2019s] Sagrada Familia,\u201d says P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir. But the aesthetic output is not really the point; the architects\u2019 goal is to galvanize architects today and spark an urgent discussion about the impact of climate change on our cities. She stresses the value of what can only be described as moonshot thinking. \u201cI think it is important for architects not to be only in the present,\u201d she told me. \u201cBecause if we are only in the present, working inside the system, we won\u2019t change anything.\u201d P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir was born in 1972 in H\u00fasavik, a town known as the whale-watching capital of Iceland. But she was more interested in space and technology and spent a lot of time flying with her father, a construction engineer who owned a small plane. She credits his job for the curiosity she developed about science and \u201chow things were put together\u201d\u2014an inclination that proved useful later, when she started researching volcanoes. So was the fact that Icelanders \u201clearn to live with volcanoes from birth.\u201d At 21, she moved to Norway, where she spent seven years working in 3D visualization before returning to Reykjavik and enrolling in an architecture program at the Iceland University of the Arts. But things didn\u2019t click until she moved to Barcelona for a master\u2019s degree at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia. \u201cI remember being there and feeling, finally, like I was in the exact right place,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Before, architecture had seemed like a commodity and architects like \u201cslaves to investment companies,\u201d she says. Now, it felt like a path with potential.\u00a0  COURTESY OF S.AP ARKITEKTAR   COURTESY OF S.AP ARKITEKTAR   COURTESY OF S.AP ARKITEKTAR   COURTESY OF S.AP ARKITEKTAR   Lava has proved to be a strong, durable building material, at least in its solid state. To explore its potential, P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir and Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson envision a city built on a network of trenches that have filled with lava over the course of several eruptions, while buildings are constructed with lava bricks.  She returned to Reykjavik in 2009 and worked as an architect until she founded S.AP (for \u201cstudio Arnhildur P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir\u201d) Arkitektar in 2018; her son started working with her in 2019 and officially joined her as an architect this year, after graduating from the Southern California Institute of Architecture.",
    "In 2021, the pair witnessed their first eruption up close, near the Fagradalsfjall volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula. It was there that P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir became aware of the sheer quantity of material coursing through the planet\u2019s veins, and the potential to divert it into channels.\u00a0 Lava has already proved to be a strong, long-lasting building material\u2014at least in its solid state. When it cools, it solidifies into volcanic rock like basalt or rhyolite. The type of rock depends on the composition of the lava, but basaltic lava\u2014like the kind found in Iceland and Hawaii\u2014forms one of the hardest rocks on Earth, which means that structures built from this type of lava would be durable and resilient.\u00a0 For years, architects in Mexico, Iceland, and Hawaii (where lava is widely available) have built structures out of volcanic rock. But quarrying that rock is an energy-intensive process that requires heavy machines to extract, cut, and haul it, often across long distances, leaving a big carbon footprint. Harnessing lava in its molten state, however, could unlock new methods for sustainable construction. Jeffrey Karson, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University who specializes in volcanic activity and who cofounded the Syracuse University Lava Project, agrees that lava is abundant enough to warrant interest as a building material. To understand how it behaves, Karson has spent the past 15 years performing over a thousand controlled lava pours from giant furnaces. If we figure out how to build up its strength as it cools, he says, \u201cthat stuff has a lot of potential.\u201d\u00a0 In his research, Karson found that inserting metal rods into the lava flow helps reduce the kind of uneven cooling that would lead to thermal cracking\u2014and therefore makes the material stronger (a bit like rebar in concrete). Like glass and other molten materials, lava behaves differently depending on how fast it cools. When glass or lava cools slowly, crystals start forming, strengthening the material. Replicating this process\u2014perhaps in a kiln\u2014could slow down the rate of cooling and let the lava become stronger. This kind of controlled cooling is \u201ceasy to do on small things like bricks,\u201d says Karson, so \u201cit\u2019s not impossible to make a wall.\u201d\u00a0 P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir is clear-eyed about the challenges before her. She knows the techniques she and Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson are exploring may not lead to anything tangible in their lifetimes, but they still believe that the ripple effect the projects could create in the architecture community is worth pursuing. Both Karson and Pedersen caution that more experiments are necessary to study this material\u2019s potential. For Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson, that potential transcends the building industry. More than 12 years ago, Icelanders voted that the island\u2019s natural resources, like its volcanoes and fishing waters, should be declared national property. That means any city built from lava flowing out of these volcanoes would be controlled not by deep-pocketed individuals or companies, but by the nation itself. (The referendum was considered illegal almost as soon as it was approved by voters and has since stalled.)\u00a0 For Skarph\u00e9\u00f0insson, the Lavaforming project is less about the material than about the \u201cpolitical implications that get brought to the surface with this material.\u201d \u201cThat is the change I want to see in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could force us to make radical changes and be a catalyst for something\u201d\u2014perhaps a social megalopolis where citizens have more say in how resources are used and profits are shared more evenly. Cynics might dismiss the idea of harnessing lava as pure folly. But the more I spoke with P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir, the more convinced I became. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time in modern history that a seemingly dangerous idea (for example, drilling into scalding pockets of underground hot springs) proved revolutionary. Once entirely dependent on oil, Iceland today obtains 85% of its electricity and heat from renewable sources. \u201c[My friends] probably think I\u2019m pretty crazy, but they think maybe we could be clever geniuses,\u201d she told me with a laugh. Maybe she is a little bit of both. Elissaveta M. Brandon is a regular contributor to Fast Company and Wired. hide"
