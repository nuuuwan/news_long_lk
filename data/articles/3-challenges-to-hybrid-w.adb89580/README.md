# 3 Challenges to Hybrid Work â€” and How to Overcome Them

## Summary ðŸ¤–

Managers attempting to implement hybrid work policies face three main challenges: scheduling, maintaining culture, and ensuring productivity. To tackle scheduling, focus should shift from tracking when workers are in the office to identifying which tasks are better done in the physical work environment. Culture can be maintained by encouraging employees to go to the office for the sake of their colleagues, not just the organization or themselves. Lastly, productivity should be ensured through supportive measures rather than surveillance.

Managers struggling to implement hybrid work policies confront three key challenges: scheduling, culture, and productivity. Research into companies allowing employees to be both remote and in-person suggest these obstacles can be overcome. In scheduling, shift to a focus not on how often workers are in, but which activities are better done in the office. To build and maintain culture, encourage employees to come in not for the organization or themselves but for their colleagues. And to ensure productivity, avoid surveillance in favor of support.

More than four years after the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated an immediate shift to remote knowledge work, itâ€™s clear that, despite some organizationsâ€™ attempts to lure employees back to the office full-time, hybrid work arrangements are here to stay. And yet employers are still struggling with Â implementation. In particular, the managers we have talked to point to three key issues: scheduling, culture, and productivity.
