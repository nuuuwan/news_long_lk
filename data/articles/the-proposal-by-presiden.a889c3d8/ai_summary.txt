Facts:

- President Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed a six months service extension for Sri Lanka's Attorney General, a move that has created political controversy and potentially damages the reputation of the chief law officer.
- The proposal for extension comes as the incumbent Attorney General is set to retire later in the month.
- The President has justified this attempt by claiming that the Attorney General has been involved in critical matters, such as ongoing discussions with the Catholic Church regarding the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, and legal proceedings related to compensation over marine destruction caused by the X-Press Pearl ship incident.
- In response to the President’s justification, both the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka and the Opposition have severely castigated the extension explanation, labeling the insinuation as 'false, misleading, and malicious.'
- The President has also appointed another committee of inquiry to investigate actions of the state intelligence services and other security agencies' concealment of prior information about the Easter Sunday attacks.
- The Supreme Court has recently quashed pardons given to convicted offenders.

Opinions:

- The proposal for extension does not bode well for the health of the nation’s constitutional democracy and is seen as a further politicization of the office.
- The President's reasons for extension, citing ongoing prosecutions and specific incidents, are viewed as falling short of justifying the need for the extension and ridiculing the Attorney General's office.
- The Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka believes that the President's insinuation that they are responsible for the proposed extension is not only false but also misleading and malicious.
- The Opposition senses a sinister conspiracy in trying to extend the service of the Attorney General, seeing it as an attempt to subvert elections.
- The move to form another committee to investigate state intelligence actions regarding the Easter Sunday attacks is seen as redundant, because similar inquiries have already been conducted.
- The author considers the President's actions contradictory to his rhetoric on accountability to the people and questions if his 'ongoing reform agenda' may limit his ability to appoint committees, which are seen as diversions of accountability.
