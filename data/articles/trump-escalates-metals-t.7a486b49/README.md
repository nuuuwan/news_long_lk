Trump escalates metals tariffs, but leaves room for talks

What’s happened?The US government has announced a blanket 25% tariff on all imports of steel and aluminium. This policy eliminates all previous exemptions for the existing 25% steel tariffs and cancels those for aluminium, while raising the aluminium tariff from the 10% rate introduced during the first Trump administration. Departing from earlier measures, the administration claims that no exemptions will be available, and existing agreements with third countries that previously secured tariff relief will be terminated. The “product exclusion process”, which allowed firms to apply for exemptions by demonstrating that no alternative domestic supply was available, has been abolished. The tariffs will come into effect on March 12th. The apparent absence of any exemption process is an additional cause for concern, but our baseline remains that some exemptions—both for countries who strike deals with the US and firms will be granted. Conflict with the EU is more likely owing to the lack of a Trump 1.0 steel or aluminium agreement and the need for Mr Trump to follow through on at least some of his threatened tariffs to retain credibility.Why does it matter?Steel and aluminium have long been central to US trade policy, and featured prominently in the trade conflict initiated by the first Trump administration. In 2018 Mr Trump invoked Section 232—a legal tool that permits tariffs on imports posing a national security threat—to impose a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium. Several key exporting nations secured exemptions: Australia was granted full relief; South Korea, Brazil and Argentina obtained partial exemptions through quotas, with Brazil receiving a steel quota and Argentina quotas for both metals. Additionally, Mexico and Canada had their tariffs removed as part of a voluntary export restriction agreement reached during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiations. Although most tariffs remained in effect at the end of 2020, the Biden administration later removed those on the EU and the UK in return for a quota arrangement set to expire in March. These measures contributed to a recovery in steel and aluminium imports into the US following their initial decline between 2018 and 2020, while only China continues to face most of the original tariffs—albeit with the product exclusion process significantly reducing its effective rate.If implemented, the new tariffs will substantially increase the cost of steel and aluminium inputs. When the 2018 tariffs were introduced, US steel and iron prices surged by nearly 20% from the start of the investigation in April 2017 until tariffs peaked in December 2018, placing a significant burden on domestic industry. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) underwent a similar surge in 2017–18, and we anticipate a comparable rise this time. However, one factor that may temper the global shock is the US’s reduced reliance on Chinese steel imports compared with the last trade war, meaning that Chinese export prices, which remain an important global benchmark, may have less scope to drive a broad-based price spike. By contrast, a potential 25% tariff on Canadian-origin aluminium could significantly disrupt trade flows, as Canada supplies nearly two-thirds of all US primary aluminium imports—2.7m tonnes in 2023, with a similar volume expected in 2024. Meanwhile, Midwest aluminium premiums have jumped from 21.5 US cents/lb in November 2024 to 29 cents/lb in early February—a 40% rise—as consumers have rushed to secure supply ahead of any decision. Although LME prices have briefly receded by about US$100/tonne on news that the implementation of 25% tariffs on Canada may be delayed by a month, heightened volatility looks set to continue.Research from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors indicates that by mid-2019 these increased costs had reduced manufacturing employment by about 0.6%, equating to 75,000 fewer jobs—excluding further losses incurred by US exporters facing retaliatory tariffs. We do not expect domestic production to expand sufficiently to offset these higher import costs. In 2018 the increase in domestic output was only modest. Some firms encountered genuine resource constraints, while others opted to absorb the cost increases within their margins, thereby heightening the likelihood of sustained cost pressures.We expect countries and firms to lobby for a return to the previous system of agreements and exemptions, with some likely to succeed despite the administration’s initial refusal to negotiate any exemptions. Mr Trump has already demonstrated a willingness to accept relatively cosmetic concessions in exchange for deferred tariffs. Existing country-level agreements offer ready-made templates for reinstatement. Countries that secured agreements with the first Trump administration—including Mexico, Canada, Brazil, South Korea, Australia (whose prime minister has already had a call with Mr Trump about a potential exemption) and Argentina—will face fewer obstacles, whereas those established under the Biden administration, such as the EU, are likely to encounter more challenges. We do not expect China to agree to any exemption or reduction in tariffs.We expect swift retaliation from US trading partners that do not secure exemption. In particular, the EU is preparing to counter the new US metal tariffs, which are set to take effect on March 12th, with a series of targeted measures. Drawing lessons from its response in 2018, when counter-tariffs were eventually imposed on about €2.8bn (US$2.89bn) of US exports including familiar American brands, EU officials now signal that retaliatory duties could reach levels as high as 50% on a broad array of US products valued at €4.8bn (US$4.95bn), such as bourbon whisky, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and motorboats. Top EU leaders have stressed that any response will be calibrated to protect their economic interests while preserving the integrity of established transatlantic trade links, and high-level discussions with US counterparts are already under way. Given these actions and the bloc’s firm stance, a prompt and forceful EU reaction appears inevitable.What next?In addition to the steel and aluminium tariffs set to take effect on March 12th, Mr Trump has signalled plans to impose separate, blanket reciprocal tariffs on any nation that levies uneven duty rates on US exports. This “if they charge us, we charge them” approach aims to counterbalance protectionist measures abroad, but it carries significant risks. An overly aggressive tactic could provoke swift, extensive retaliatory actions from key trading partners (the EU and China have now both announced retaliation in response to their respective US tariffs), triggering an even more rapid escalation of the trade dispute.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU’s Country Analysis service.
