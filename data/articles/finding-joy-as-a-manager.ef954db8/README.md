When work and life are overwhelming, it can be difficult to reclaim a sense of joy at work. Research has shown the benefits of incorporating joy, hope, and optimism into the workplace to combat burnout and improve well-being. The author recommends four strategies to reconnect with joy at work on your toughest days: 1) Find your why: Reconnect with your passion and purpose by aligning your work with what brings you joy, what you are good at, and what the world needs. 2) Embrace a beginner’s mindset: Approach challenges with curiosity and openness, fostering a sense of wonder. 3) Sprinkle gratitude and joy like confetti: Actively recognize and celebrate contributions to build a supportive and cohesive team culture. 4) Fuel your joy: Maintain positive reminders and practice self-compassion to sustain energy and enthusiasm in your role.

Several months into the pandemic, I found myself feeling persistently down as the new leader of a global team. Each day, I faced a wave of challenges for colleagues I’d never met and planned strategies for offices I had never seen. The rising tide of crushing workloads and interpersonal tensions threatened to pull us under. At the same time, the lack of face-to-face interactions left me yearning for the teamwork that could sustain us through difficult times. With uncertainty and fear everywhere, finding inspiration felt nearly impossible.
