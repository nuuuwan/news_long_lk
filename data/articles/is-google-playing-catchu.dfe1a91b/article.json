    "This story originally appeared in\u00a0The Debrief with Mat Honan, a weekly newsletter about the biggest stories in tech from our editor in chief.\u00a0Sign up here\u00a0to get the next one in your inbox. I\u2019ve been mulling over something that Will Heaven, our senior editor for AI,\u00a0pointed out not too long ago: that all the big players in AI seem to be moving in the same directions and converging on the same things. Agents. Deep research. Lightweight versions of models. Etc.\u00a0  Some of this makes sense in that they\u2019re seeing similar things and trying to solve similar problems. But when I talked to Will about this, he said, \u201cit almost feels like a lack of imagination, right?\u201d Yeah. It does. What got me thinking about this, again, was a pair of announcements from Google over the past couple of weeks, both related to the ways search is converging with AI language models, something\u00a0I\u2019ve spent a lot of time reporting on over the past year. Google took direct aim at this intersection by adding new AI features from Gemini to search, and also by adding search features to Gemini. In using both, what struck me more than\u00a0how well\u00a0they work is that they are really just about catching up with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. \u00a0And their belated appearance in March of the year 2025 doesn\u2019t seem like a great sign for Google.",
    "Related StoryAI means the end of internet search as we\u2019ve known itDespite fewer clicks, copyright fights, and sometimes iffy answers, AI could unlock new ways to summon all the world\u2019s knowledge.",
    "Take AI Mode, which it\u00a0announced March 5. It\u2019s cool. It works well. But it\u2019s pretty much a follow-along of what OpenAI was already doing. (Also, don\u2019t be confused by the name. Google already had something called AI Overviews in search, but AI Mode is different and deeper.) As the company explained in a blog post, \u201cThis new Search mode expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities so you can get help with even your toughest questions.\u201d Rather than a brief overview with links out, the AI will dig in and offer more robust answers. You can ask followup questions too, something AI Overviews doesn\u2019t support. It feels like quite a natural evolution\u2014so much so that it\u2019s curious why this is not already widely available. For now, it\u2019s limited to people with paid accounts, and even then only via the experimental sandbox of Search Labs. But more to the point, why wasn\u2019t it available, say, last summer?",
    "The second change is that\u00a0it added search history to its Gemini chatbot, and promises even more personalization is on the way. On this one, Google says \u201cpersonalization allows Gemini to connect with your Google apps and services, starting with Search, to provide responses that are uniquely insightful and directly address your needs.\u201d Much of what these new features are doing, especially AI Mode\u2019s ability to ask followup questions and go deep, feels like hitting feature parity with what ChatGPT has been doing for months. It\u2019s also been compared to Perplexity, another generative AI search engine startup.\u00a0 What neither feature feels like is something fresh and new. Neither feels innovative. ChatGPT has long been building user histories and using the information it has to deliver results. While Gemini could also remember things about you, it\u2019s a little bit shocking to me that Google has taken this long to bring in signals from its other products. Obviously there are privacy concerns to field, but this is an opt-in product we\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 The other thing is that, at least as I\u2019ve found so far, ChatGPT is just better at this stuff. Here\u2019s a small example. I tried asking both: \u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d ChatGPT replied with a really insightful, even thoughtful, profile based on my interactions with it. These aren\u2019t \u00a0just the things I\u2019ve explicitly told it to remember about me, either. Much of it comes from the context of various prompts I\u2019ve fed it. It\u2019s figured out what kind of music I like. It knows little details about my taste in films. (\u201cYou don't particularly enjoy slasher films in general.\u201d) Some of it is just sort of oddly delightful. For example: \u201cYou built a\u00a0small shed for trash cans\u00a0with a hinged wooden roof and needed a solution to hold it open.\u201dGoogle, despite having literal decades of my email, search, and browsing history, a copy of every digital photo I\u2019ve ever taken, and more darkly terrifying insight into the depths of who I really am than I probably I do myself, mostly spat back the kind of profile an\u00a0advertiser\u00a0would want, versus a person hoping for useful tailored results. (\"You enjoy comedy, music, podcasts, and are interested in both current and classic media\")  I enjoy music, you say? Remarkable!\u00a0 I\u2019m also reminded of something an OpenAI executive said to me late last year, as the company was preparing to roll out search. It has more freedom to innovate precisely because it doesn\u2019t have the massive legacy business that Google does. Yes, it\u2019s\u00a0burning money\u00a0while Google mints it. But OpenAI has the luxury of being able to experiment (at least until the capital runs out) without worrying about killing a cash cow like Google has with traditional search.\u00a0 Related StoryRoundtables: Generative AI Search and the Changing InternetOf course, it\u2019s clear that Google and its parent company Alphabet\u00a0can innovate in many areas\u2014see Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini Robotics\u00a0announcement\u00a0this week, for example. Or ride in a Waymo! But can it do so around its core products and business? It\u2019s not the only big legacy tech company with this problem. Microsoft\u2019s AI strategy to date has largely been reliant on its partnership with OpenAI. And Apple, meanwhile, seems completely lost in the wilderness, as\u00a0this scathing takedown from longtime Apple pundit John Gruber lays bare.\u00a0 Google has billions of users and piles of cash. It can leverage its existing base in ways OpenAI or Anthropic (which Google also owns a good chunk of) or Perplexity just aren\u2019t capable of. But I\u2019m also pretty convinced that unless it can be the market leader here, rather than a follower, it points to some painful days ahead. But hey,\u00a0Astra is coming. Let\u2019s see what happens. hide"
