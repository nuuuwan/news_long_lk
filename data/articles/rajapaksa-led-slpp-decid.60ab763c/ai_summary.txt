1Ô∏è‚É£ The leading Sri Lankan party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), will not support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential polls in September.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The decision was made after a recent central committee meeting, ending the Rajapaksa clan's support for Wickremesinghe, whom they helped reach power in 2022.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Wickremesinghe replaced former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who resigned due to mass protests blaming him for Sri Lanka's severe economic crash.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Despite praise for stepping in during a crisis and stabilizing the economy, Wickremesinghe's reliance on and association with the Rajapaksa clan has faced criticism.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The Rajapaksa brothers were found by Sri Lanka's Supreme Court in 2023 to have contributed to the country's economic downfall and violated public trust, yet faced no consequences.
6Ô∏è‚É£ SLPP General Secretary Kariyawasam stated their withdrawal of support was due to disagreeable policies by Wickremesinghe, particularly concerning privatisation of national assets.
7Ô∏è‚É£ There is speculation that a candidate outside the Rajapaksa family may be fielded by the SLPP for the first time.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Some SLPP members, particularly those in Wickremesinghe's Cabinet, are likely to continue supporting him, indicating a potential party split.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Namal Rajapaksa, son of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, accuses Wickremesinghe of dividing the party that supported him for two years.
üîü Wickremesinghe now primarily has the backing of the United National Party and minority groups, and faces strong opposition from Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People‚Äôs Power alliance.
