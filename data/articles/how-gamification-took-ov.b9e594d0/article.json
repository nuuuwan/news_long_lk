    "It\u2019s a thought that occurs to every video-game player at some point: What if the weird, hyper-focused state I enter when playing in virtual worlds could somehow be applied to the real one?\u00a0 Often pondered during especially challenging or tedious tasks in meatspace (writing essays, say, or doing your taxes), it\u2019s an eminently reasonable question to ask. Life, after all, is hard. And while video games are too, there\u2019s something almost magical about the way they can promote sustained bouts of superhuman concentration and resolve.

    "For some, this phenomenon leads to an interest in flow states and immersion. For others, it\u2019s simply a reason to play more games. For a handful of consultants, startup gurus, and game designers in the late 2000s, it became the key to unlocking our true human potential. In her 2010 TED Talk, \u201cGaming Can Make a Better World,\u201d the game designer Jane McGonigal called this engaged state \u201cblissful productivity.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we know when we\u2019re playing a game that we\u2019re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time.\u201d",
    "McGonigal\u2019s basic pitch was this: By making the real world more like a video game, we could harness the blissful productivity of millions of people and direct it at some of humanity\u2019s thorniest problems\u2014things like poverty, obesity, and climate change. The exact details of how to accomplish this were a bit vague (play more games?), but her objective was clear: \u201cMy goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games.\u201d While the word \u201cgamification\u201d never came up during her talk, by that time anyone following the big-ideas circuit (TED, South by Southwest, DICE, etc.) or using the new Foursquare app would have been familiar with the basic idea. Broadly defined as the application of game design elements and principles to non-game activities\u2014think points, levels, missions, badges, leaderboards, reinforcement loops, and so on\u2014gamification was already being hawked as a revolutionary new tool for transforming education, work, health and fitness, and countless other parts of life.",
    "Instead of liberating us, gamification turned out to be just another tool for coercion, distraction, and control.  Adding \u201cworld-saving\u201d to the list of potential benefits was perhaps inevitable, given the prevalence of that theme in video-game storylines. But it also spoke to gamification\u2019s foundational premise: the idea that reality is somehow broken. According to McGonigal and other gamification boosters, the real world is insufficiently engaging and motivating, and too often it fails to make us happy. Gamification promises to remedy this design flawby engineering a new reality, one that transforms the dull, difficult, and depressing parts of life into something fun and inspiring. Studying for exams, doing household chores, flossing, exercising, learning a new language\u2014there was no limit to the tasks that could be turned into games, making everything IRL better. Today, we live in an undeniably gamified world. We stand up and move around to close colorful rings and earn achievement badges on our smartwatches; we meditate and sleep to recharge our body batteries; we plant virtual trees to be more productive; we chase \u201clikes\u201d and \u201ckarma\u201d on social media sites and try to swipe our way toward social connection. And yet for all the crude gamelike elements that have been grafted onto our lives, the more hopeful and collaborative world that gamification promised more than a decade ago seems as far away as ever. Instead of liberating us from drudgery and maximizing our potential, gamification turned out to be just another tool for coercion, distraction, and control.\u00a0 Con game This was not an unforeseeable outcome. From the start, a small but vocal group of journalists and game designers warned against the fairy-tale thinking and facile view of video games that they saw in the concept of gamification. Adrian Hon, author of You\u2019ve Been Played, a recent book that chronicles its dangers, was one of them.\u00a0 \u201cAs someone who was building so-called \u2018serious games\u2019 at the time the concept was taking off, I knew that a lot of the claims being made around the possibility of games to transform people\u2019s behaviors and change the world were completely overblown,\u201d he says.\u00a0  Hon isn\u2019t some knee-jerk polemicist. A trained neuroscientist who switched to a career in game design and development, he\u2019s the co-creator of Zombies, Run!\u2014one of the most popular gamified fitness apps in the world. While he still believes games can benefit and enrich aspects of our nongaming lives, Hon says a one-size-fits-all approach is bound to fail. For this reason, he\u2019s firmly against both the superficial layering of generic points, leaderboards, and missions atop everyday activities and the more coercive forms of gamification that have invaded the workplace.  SELMAN DESIGN   Ironically, it\u2019s these broad and varied uses that make criticizing the practice so difficult. As Hon notes in his book, gamification has always been a fast-moving target, varying dramatically in scale, scope, and technology over the years. As the concept has evolved, so too have its applications, whether you think of the gambling mechanics that now encourage users of dating apps to keep swiping, the \u201cquests\u201d that compel exhausted Uber drivers to complete just a few more trips, or the utopian ambition of using gamification to save the world. In the same way that AI\u2019s lack of a fixed definition today makes it easy to dismiss any one critique for not addressing some other potential definition of it, so too do gamification\u2019s varied interpretations. \u201cI remember giving talks critical of gamification at gamification conferences, and people would come up to me afterwards and be like, \u2018Yeah, bad gamification is bad, right? But we\u2019re doing good gamification,\u2019\u201d says Hon. (They weren\u2019t.)\u00a0 For some critics, the very idea of \u201cgood gamification\u201d was anathema. Their main gripe with the term and practice was, and remains, that it has little to nothing to do with actual games.",
    "\u201cA game is about play and disruption and creativity and ambiguity and surprise,\u201d wrote the late Jeff Watson, a game designer, writer, and educator who taught at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts. Gamification is about the opposite\u2014the known, the badgeable, the quantifiable. \u201cIt\u2019s about \u2018checking in,\u2019 being tracked \u2026 [and] becoming more regimented. It\u2019s a surveillance and discipline system\u2014a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Beware its lure.\u201d Another game designer, Margaret Robertson, has argued that gamification should really be called \u201cpointsification,\u201d writing: \u201cWhat we\u2019re currently terming gamification is in fact the process of taking the thing that is least essential to games and representing it as the core of the experience. Points and badges have no closer a relationship to games than they do to websites and fitness apps and loyalty cards.\u201d For the author and game designer Ian Bogost, the entire concept amounted to a marketing gimmick. In a now-famous essay published in the Atlantic in 2011, he likened gamification to the moral philosopher Harry Frankfurt\u2019s definition of bullshit\u2014that is, a strategy intended to persuade or coerce without regard for actual truth.\u00a0 \u201cThe idea of learning or borrowing lessons from game design and applying them to other areas was never the issue for me,\u201d Bogost told me. \u201cRather, it was not doing that\u2014acknowledging that there\u2019s something mysterious, powerful, and compelling about games, but rather than doing the hard work, doing no work at all and absconding with the spirit of the form.\u201d\u00a0  Gaming the system So how did a misleading term for a misunderstood process that\u2019s probably just bullshit come to infiltrate virtually every part of our lives? There\u2019s no one simple answer. But gamification\u2019s meteoric rise starts to make a lot more sense when you look at the period that gave birth to the idea.\u00a0 The late 2000s and early 2010s were, as many have noted, a kind of high-water mark for techno-\u00adoptimism. For people both inside the tech industry and out, there was a sense that humanity had finally wrapped its arms around a difficult set of problems, and that technology was going to help us squeeze out some solutions. The Arab Spring bloomed in 2011 with the help of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, money was more or less free, and \u201c____ can save the world\u201d articles were legion (with ____ being everything from \u201ceating bugs\u201d to \u201cdesign thinking\u201d). This was also the era that produced the 10,000-hours rule of success, the long tail, the four-hour workweek, the wisdom of crowds, nudge theory, and a number of other highly simplistic (or, often, flat-out wrong) theories about the way humans, the internet, and the world work.\u00a0  \u201cAll of a sudden you had VC money and all sorts of important, high-net-worth people showing up at game developer conferences.\u201d Ian Bogost, author and game designer Adding video games to this heady stew of optimism gave the game industry something it had long sought but never achieved: legitimacy. Even with games ascendant in popular culture\u2014and on track to eclipse both the film and music industries in terms of revenue\u2014they still were largely seen as a frivolous, productivity-\u00adsquandering, violence-encouraging form of entertainment. Seemingly overnight, gamification changed all that.",
    "\u201cThere was definitely this black-sheep mentality in the game development community\u2014the sense that what we had been doing for decades was just a joke to people,\u201d says Bogost. \u201cAll of a sudden you had VC money and all sorts of important, high-net-worth people showing up at game developer conferences, and it was like, \u2018Finally someone\u2019s noticing. They realize that we have something to offer.\u2019\u201d This wasn\u2019t just flattering; it was intoxicating. Gamification took a derided pursuit and recast it as a force for positive change, a way to make the real world better. While\u00a0 enthusiastic calls to \u201cbuild a game layer on top of reality\u201d may sound dystopian to many of us today, the sentiment didn\u2019t necessarily have the same ominous undertones at the end of the aughts.",
    "Combine the cultural recasting of games with an array of cheaper and faster technologies\u2014GPS, ubiquitous and reliable mobile internet, powerful smartphones, Web 2.0 tools and services\u2014and you arguably had all the ingredients needed for gamification\u2019s rise. In a very real sense, reality in 2010 was ready to be gamified. Or to put it a slightly different way: Gamification was an idea perfectly suited for its moment.\u00a0 Gaming behavior Fine, you might be asking at this point, but does it work? Surely, companies like Apple, Uber, Strava, Microsoft, Garmin, and others wouldn\u2019t bother gamifying their products and services if there were no evidence of the strategy\u2019s efficacy. The answer to the question, unfortunately, is super annoying: Define work.  Because gamification is so pervasive and varied, it\u2019s hard to address its effectiveness in any direct or comprehensive way. But one can confidently say this: Gamification did not save the world. Climate change still exists. As do obesity, poverty, and war. Much of generic gamification\u2019s power supposedly resides in its ability to nudge or steer us toward, or away from, certain behaviors using competition (challenges and leaderboards), rewards (points and achievement badges), and other sources of positive and negative feedback.\u00a0  Gamification is, and has always been, a way to induce specific behaviors in people using virtual carrots and sticks.  On that front, the results are mixed. Nudge theory lost much of its shine with academics in 2022 after a meta-analysis of previous studies concluded that, after correcting for publication bias, there wasn\u2019t much evidence it worked to change behavior at all. Still, there are a lot of ways to nudge and a lot of behaviors to modify. The fact remains that plenty of people claim to be highly motivated to close their rings, earn their sleep crowns, or hit or exceed some increasingly ridiculous number of steps on their Fitbits (see humorist David Sedaris).\u00a0 Sebastian Deterding, a leading researcher in the field, argues that gamification can work, but its successes tend to be really hard to replicate. Not only do academics not know what works, when, and how, according to Deterding, but \u201cwe mostly have just-so stories without data or empirical testing.\u201d\u00a0  SELMAN DESIGN   In truth, gamification acolytes were always pulling from an old playbook\u2014one that dates back to the early 20th century. Then, behaviorists like John Watson and B.F. Skinner saw human behaviors (a category that for Skinner included thoughts, actions, feelings, and emotions) not as the products of internal mental states or cognitive processes but, rather, as the result of external forces\u2014forces that could conveniently be manipulated.",
    "If Skinner\u2019s theory of operant conditioning, which doled out rewards to positively reinforce certain behaviors, sounds a lot like Amazon\u2019s \u201cFulfillment Center Games,\u201d which dole out rewards to compel workers to work harder, faster, and longer\u2014well, that\u2019s not a coincidence. Gamification is, and has always been, a way to induce specific behaviors in people using virtual carrots and sticks.\u00a0 Related StoryAlgorithms are everywhereThree new books warn against turning into the person the algorithm thinks you are.",
    "Sometimes this may work; other times not. But ultimately, as Hon points out, the question of efficacy may be beside the point. \u201cThere is no before or after to compare against if your life is always being gamified,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even a static form of gamification that can be measured, since the design of coercive gamification is always changing, a moving target that only goes toward greater and more granular intrusion.\u201d\u00a0 The game of life Like any other art form, video games offer a staggering array of possibilities. They can educate, entertain, foster social connection, inspire, and encourage us to see the world in different ways. Some of the best ones manage to do all of this at once. Yet for many of us, there\u2019s the sense today that we\u2019re stuck playing an exhausting game that we didn\u2019t opt into. This one assumes that our behaviors can be changed with shiny digital baubles, constant artificial competition, and meaningless prizes. Even more insulting, the game acts as if it exists for our benefit\u2014promising to make us fitter, happier, and more productive\u2014when in truth it\u2019s really serving the commercial and business interests of its makers.",
    "Metaphors can be an imperfect but necessary way to make sense of the world. Today, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear talk of leveling up, having a God Mode mindset, gaining XP, and turning life\u2019s difficulty settings up (or down). But the metaphor that resonates most for me\u2014the one that seems to neatly capture our current predicament\u2014is that of the NPC, or non-player character.\u00a0\u00a0 NPCs are the \u201cSisyphean machines\u201d of video games, programmed to follow a defined script forever and never question or deviate. They\u2019re background players in someone else\u2019s story, typically tasked with furthering a specific plotline or performing some manual labor. To call someone an NPC in real life is to accuse them of just going through the motions, not thinking for themselves, not being able to make their own decisions. This, for me, is gamification\u2019s real end result. It\u2019s acquiescence pretending to be empowerment. It strips away the very thing that makes games unique\u2014a sense of agency\u2014and then tries to mask that with crude stand-ins for accomplishment. So what can we do? Given the reach and pervasiveness of gamification, critiquing it at this point can feel a little pointless, like railing against capitalism. And yet its own failed promises may point the way to a possible respite. If gamifying the world has turned our lives into a bad version of a video game, perhaps this is the perfect moment to reacquaint ourselves with why actual video games are great in the first place. Maybe, to borrow an idea from McGonigal, we should all start playing better games.\u00a0 Bryan Gardiner is a writer based in Oakland, California.\u00a0 hide"
