While companies have long struggled to wring value out of their data initiatives, something big has changed in the last two years: Generative AI has spurred greater interest and investment in data quality and broader data capabilities. To succeed with AI, companies are doubling down on finally getting data right. According to an invite-only industry benchmark survey of Fortune 1000 and global business leaders: 1) Corporate investments in AI and data are growing. 2) Organizations are reporting business value from their AI investments. 3) Transformation due to AI will be gradual for most organizations. 4) Organizations are focusing on responsible AI, safeguards, and guardrails. 5) Organizations are hiring chief AI officers as AI and data leadership roles evolve. 6) AI and data leaders are joining the C-suite to drive business goals.

For decades, companies have struggled to capture and integrate data into their decision-making. In spite of protracted efforts, the results have been decidedly mixed. Last year, just 37% of companies reported that efforts to improve data quality had been successful. But recently, something significant has changed: Generative AI has spurred greater interest and investment in data quality and broader data capabilities. After all, great AI relies on great data. Gone are the days when executives dismissed investments in initiatives like these as “just another data project.” Now, to succeed with AI, companies are doubling down on finally getting data right.
