    "Privacy only matters to those with something to hide. So goes one of the more inane and disingenuous justifications for mass government and corporate surveillance. There are others, of course, but the \u201cnothing to hide\u201d argument remains a popular way to rationalize or excuse what\u2019s become standard practice in our digital age: the widespread and invasive collection of vast amounts of personal data. One common response to this line of reasoning is that everyone, in fact, has something to hide, whether they realize it or not. If you\u2019re unsure of whether this holds true for you, I encourage you to read Means of Control by Byron Tau.\u00a0  Means of Control: How the Hidden Alliance of Tech and Government Is Creating a New American Surveillance StateByron TauCROWN, 2024   Midway through his book, Tau, an investigative journalist, recalls meeting with a disgruntled former employee of a data broker\u2014a shady company that collects, bundles, and sells your personal data to other (often shadier) third parties, including the government. This ex-employee had managed to make off with several gigabytes of location data representing the precise movements of tens of thousands of people over the course of a few weeks. \u201cWhat could I learn with this [data]\u2014\u00adtheoretically?\u201d Tau asks the former employee. The answer includes a laundry list of possibilities that I suspect would make even the most enthusiastic oversharer uncomfortable.  \u201cIf information is power, and America is a society that\u2019s still interested in the guarantee of liberty, personal dignity, and the individual freedom of its citizens, a serious conversation is needed.\u201d Bryon Tau, author of Means of Control Did someone in this group recently visit an abortion clinic? That would be easy to figure out, says the ex-employee. Anyone attend an AA meeting or check into inpatient drug rehab? Again, pretty simple to discern. Is someone being treated for erectile dysfunction at a sexual health clinic? If so, that would probably be gleanable from the data too. Tau never opts to go down that road, but as Means of Control makes very clear, others certainly have done so and will.",
    "While most of us are at least vaguely aware that our phones and apps are a vector for data collection and tracking, both the way in which this is accomplished and the extent to which it happens often remain murky. Purposely so, argues Tau. In fact, one of the great myths Means of Control takes aim at is the very idea that what we do with our devices can ever truly be anonymized. Each of us has habits and routines that are completely unique, he says, and if an advertiser knows you only as an alphanumeric string provided by your phone as you move about the world, and not by your real name, that still offers you virtually no real privacy protection. (You\u2019ll perhaps not be surprised to learn that such \u201canonymized ad IDs\u201d are relatively easy to crack.) \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you if you\u2019ve ever been on a dating app that wanted your location, or if you ever granted a weather app permission to know where you are 24/7, there\u2019s a good chance a detailed log of your precise movement patterns has been vacuumed up and saved in some data bank somewhere that tens of thousands of total strangers have access to,\u201d writes Tau.",
    "Unraveling the story of how these strangers\u2014everyone from government intelligence agents and local law enforcement officers to private investigators and employees of ad tech companies\u2014gained access to our personal information is the ambitious task Tau sets for himself, and he begins where you might expect: the immediate aftermath of 9/11. At no other point in US history was the government\u2019s appetite for data more voracious than in the days after the attacks, says Tau. It was a hunger that just so happened to coincide with the advent of new technologies, devices, and platforms that excelled at harvesting and serving up personal information that had zero legal privacy protections.\u00a0 Related StoryOpenAI: The power and the prideTwo new books attempt to tell the story of Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI, its ambitions, and its growing empire.",
    "Over the course of 22 chapters, Tau gives readers a rare glimpse inside the shadowy industry, \u201cbuilt by corporate America and blessed by government lawyers,\u201d that emerged in the years and decades following the 9/11 attacks. In the hands of a less skilled reporter, this labyrinthine world of shell companies, data vendors, and intelligence agencies could easily become overwhelming or incomprehensible. But Tau goes to great lengths to connect dots and plots, explaining how a perfect storm of business motivations, technological breakthroughs, government paranoia, and lax or nonexistent privacy laws combined to produce the \u201cdigital panopticon\u201d we are all now living in. Means of Control doesn\u2019t offer much comfort or reassurance for privacy\u00ad-minded readers, but that\u2019s arguably the point. As Tau notes repeatedly throughout his book, this now massive system of persistent and ubiquitous surveillance works only because the public is largely unaware of it. \u201cIf information is power, and America is a society that\u2019s still interested in the guarantee of liberty, personal dignity, and the individual freedom of its citizens, a serious conversation is needed,\u201d he writes.\u00a0  As another new book makes clear, this conversation also needs to include student data. Lindsay Weinberg\u2019s Smart University: Student Surveillance in the Digital Age reveals how the motivations and interests of Big Tech are transforming higher education in ways that are increasingly detrimental to student privacy and, arguably, education as a whole.  Smart University: Student Surveillance in the Digital AgeLindsay WeinbergJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2024   By \u201csmart university,\u201d Weinberg means the growing number of public universities across the country that are being restructured around \u201cthe production and capture of digital data.\u201d Similar in vision and application to so-called \u201csmart cities,\u201d these big-data-pilled institutions are increasingly turning to technologies that can track students\u2019 movements around campus, monitor how much time they spend on learning management systems, flag those who seem to need special \u201cadvising,\u201d and \u201cnudge\u201d others toward specific courses and majors. \u201cWhat makes these digital technologies so seductive to higher education administrators, in addition to promises of cost cutting, individualized student services, and improved school rankings, is the notion that the integration of digital technology on their campuses will position universities to keep pace with technological innovation,\u201d Weinberg writes.\u00a0 Readers of Smart University will likely recognize a familiar logic at play here. Driving many of these academic tracking and data-gathering initiatives is a growing obsession with efficiency, productivity, and convenience. The result is a kind of Silicon Valley optimization mindset, but applied to higher education at scale. Get students in and out of university as fast as possible, minimize attrition, relentlessly track performance, and do it all under the guise of campus modernization and increased personalization.\u00a0 Under this emerging system, students are viewed less as self-empowered individuals and more as \u201cconsumers to be courted, future workers to be made employable for increasingly smart workplaces, sources of user-generated content for marketing and outreach, and resources to be mined for making campuses even smarter,\u201d writes Weinberg.",
    "At the heart of Smart University seems to be a relatively straightforward question: What is an education for? Although Weinberg doesn\u2019t provide a direct answer, she shows that how a university (or society) decides to answer that question can have profound impacts on how it treats its students and teachers. Indeed, as the goal of education becomes less to produce well-rounded humans capable of thinking critically and more to produce \u201cdata subjects capable of being managed and who can fill roles in the digital economy,\u201d it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re increasingly turning to the dumb idea of smart universities to get the job done.\u00a0\u00a0 If books like Means of Control and Smart University do an excellent job exposing the extent to which our privacy has been compromised, commodified, and weaponized (which they undoubtedly do), they can also start to feel a bit predictable in their final chapters. Familiar codas include calls for collective action, buttressed by a hopeful anecdote or two detailing previously successful pro-privacy wins; nods toward a bipartisan privacy bill in the works or other pieces of legislation that could potentially close some glaring surveillance loophole; and, most often, technical guides that explain how each of us, individually, might better secure or otherwise take control and \u201cownership\u201d of our personal data. The motivations behind these exhortations and privacy-centric how-to guides are understandable. After all, it\u2019s natural for readers to want answers, advice, or at least some suggestion that things could be different\u2014especially after reading about the growing list of degradations suffered under surveillance capitalism. But it doesn\u2019t take a skeptic to start to wonder if they\u2019re actually advancing the fight for privacy in the way that its advocates truly want.

    "For one thing, technology tends to move much faster than any one smartphone privacy guide or individual law could ever hope to keep up with. Similarly, framing rampant privacy abuses as a problem we each have to be responsible for addressing individually seems a lot like framing the plastic pollution crisis as something Americans could have somehow solved by recycling. It\u2019s both a misdirection and a misunderstanding of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s to his credit, then, that Lowry Pressly doesn\u2019t include a \u201cWhat is to be done\u201d section at the end of The Right to Oblivion: Privacy and the Good Life. In lieu of offering up any concrete technical or political solutions, he simply reiterates an argument he has carefully and convincingly built over the course of his book: that privacy is important \u201cnot because it empowers us to exercise control over our information, but because it protects against the creation of such information in the first place.\u201d\u00a0  The Right to Oblivion: Privacy and the Good LifeLowry PresslyHARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2024   For Pressly, a Stanford instructor, the way we currently understand and value privacy has been tainted by what he calls \u201cthe ideology of information.\u201d \u201cThis is the idea that information has a natural existence in human affairs,\u201d he writes, \u201cand that there are no aspects of human life which cannot be translated somehow into data.\u201d This way of thinking not only leads to an impoverished sense of our own humanity\u2014it also forces us into the conceptual trap of debating privacy\u2019s value using a framework (control, consent, access) established by the companies whose business model is to exploit it. The way out of this trap is to embrace what Pressly calls \u201coblivion,\u201d a kind of state of unknowing, ambiguity, and potential\u2014or, as he puts it, a realm \u201cwhere there is no information or knowledge one way or the other.\u201d While he understands that it\u2019s impossible to fully escape a modern world intent on turning us into data subjects, Pressly\u2019s book suggests we can and should support the idea that certain aspects of our (and others\u2019) subjective interior lives can never be captured by information. Privacy is important because it helps to both protect and produce these ineffable parts of our lives, which in turn gives them a sense of dignity, depth, and the possibility for change and surprise.\u00a0 Reserving or cultivating a space for oblivion in our own lives means resisting the logic that drives much of the modern world. Our inclination to \u201cjoin the conversation,\u201d share our thoughts, and do whatever it is we do when we create and curate a personal brand has become so normalized that it\u2019s practically invisible to us. According to Pressly, all that effort has only made our lives and relationships shallower, less meaningful, and less trusting.",
    "Calls for putting our screens down and stepping away from the internet are certainly nothing new. And while The Right to Oblivion isn\u2019t necessarily prescriptive about such things, Pressly does offer a beautiful and compelling vision of what can be gained when we retreat not just from the digital world but from the idea that we are somehow knowable to that world in any authentic or meaningful way.\u00a0 If all this sounds a bit philosophical, well, it is. But it would be a mistake to think of The Right to Oblivion as a mere thought exercise on privacy. Part of what makes the book so engaging and persuasive is the way in which Pressly combines a philosopher\u2019s knack for uncovering hidden assumptions with a historian\u2019s interest in and sensitivity to older (often abandoned) ways of thinking, and how they can often enlighten and inform modern problems. Pressly isn\u2019t against efforts to pass more robust privacy legislation, or even to learn how to better protect our devices against surveillance. His argument is that in order to guide such efforts, you have to both ask the right questions and frame the problem in a way that gives you and others the moral clarity and urgency to act. Your phone\u2019s privacy settings are important, but so is understanding what you\u2019re protecting when you change them.\u00a0 Bryan Gardiner is a writer based in Oakland, California.\u00a0 hide"
