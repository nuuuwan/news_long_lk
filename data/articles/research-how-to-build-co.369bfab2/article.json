    "Previous research has found that new ideas are seen as risky and are often rejected. New research suggests that this rejection can be due to people\u2019s lack of shared criteria or reference points when evaluating a potential innovation\u2019s value. In a new paper, the authors find that the more novel the idea, the more people differ on their perception of its value. They also found that disagreement itself can make people view ideas as risky and make them less likely to support them, regardless of how novel the idea is. To help teams get on the same page when it comes to new ideas, they suggest gathering information about evaluator\u2019s reference points and developing criteria that can lead to more focused discussions.",
    "Picture yourself in a meeting where a new idea has just been pitched, representing a major departure from your company\u2019s standard practices. The presenter is confident about moving forward, but their voice is quickly overtaken by a cacophony of opinions from firm opposition to enthusiastic support. How can you make sense of the noise? What weight do you give each of these opinions? And what does this disagreement say about the idea?",
