    "Your breath can give away a lot about you. Each exhalation contains all sorts of compounds, including possible biomarkers for disease or lung conditions, that could give doctors a valuable insight into your health. Now a new smart mask, developed by a team at the California Institute of Technology, could help doctors check your breath for these signals continuously and in a noninvasive way. A patient could wear the mask at home, measure their own levels, and then go to the doctor if a flare-up is likely.\u00a0  \u201cThey don't have to come to the clinic to assess their inflammation level,\u201d says Wei Gao, professor of Medical Engineering at Caltech and one of the smart mask\u2019s creators. \u201cThis can be lifesaving.\u201d The smart mask, details of which were published in Science today, uses a two-part cooling system to chill the breath of its wearer. The cooling turns the breath into exhaled breath condensate (EBC).",
    "EBC, essentially a liquid version of someone\u2019s breath, is easier to analyze, because biomarkers like nitrite and alcohol content are more concentrated in a liquid than in a gas. The mask design takes inspiration from plants\u2019 capillary abilities, using a series of microfluidic modules that create pressure to push the EBC fluid around to sensors in the mask. The sensors are connected via Bluetooth to a device like a phone, where the patient has access to real-time health readings.",

    "\u201cThe biggest challenge has always been collecting real-time samples. This problem has been solved. That's a paradigm shift,\u201d says Rajan Chakrabarty, professor of Environmental and Chemical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis and who was not involved in the research. The Caltech team tested the smart mask with patients, including several who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma or had just gotten over a covid-19 infection. They were testing the masks for comfort and breathability, but they also wanted to see if the masks actually worked at tracking useful biomarkers throughout a patient\u2019s daily activities, such as exercise and work.\u00a0 The mask picked up on higher levels of nitrite in patients who had asthma or other conditions that involved inflamed airways. It also picked up on higher alcohol content after a patient went out drinking, which demonstrates another potential application of the mask. Analyzing breath this way is more accurate than the typical breathalyzer test, which involves a patient blowing into a device. Blowing can produce imprecise results due to alcohol in saliva being spit out. The researchers hope this is just the beginning. They plan to test the masks on a larger population, and if all goes well, commercialize the masks to get them out to a wider audience. They hope the mask will be a platform for broader application, where sensors for a range of biomarkers could be slotted in and out.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I would like to be able to do is take off their sensors, put in my sensors, and this becomes the building block for doing all other types of development,\u201d says Albert Titus, professor and chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University at Buffalo and who wasn\u2019t part of the Caltech team. \u201cThat's where I\u2019d like to see it go.\u201d For example, there may be the possibility to measure ketones in the breath, a high level of which is a sign of diabetes, or glucose levels, to help people with diabetes monitor their condition. \u201cThe mask can be reconfigured for many different applications,\u201d says Gao. hide"
