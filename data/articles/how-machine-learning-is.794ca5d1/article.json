    "Do animals have names? According to the poet T.S. Eliot, cats have three: the name their owner calls them (like George); a second, more noble one (like Quaxo or Cricopat); and, finally, a \u201cdeep and inscrutable\u201d name known only to themselves \u201cthat no human research can discover.\u201d But now, researchers armed with audio recorders and pattern-recognition software are making unexpected discoveries about the secrets of animal names\u2014at least with small monkeys called marmosets.\u00a0\u00a0  That\u2019s according to a team at Hebrew University in Israel, who claim in the journal Science this week they\u2019ve discovered that marmosets \u201cvocally label\u201d their monkey friends with specific sounds. Until now, only humans, dolphins, elephants, and probably parrots had been known to use specific sounds to call out to other individuals.",
    "Marmosets are highly social creatures that maintain contact through high-pitched chirps and twitters called \u201cphee-calls.\u201d By recording different pairs of monkeys placed near each other, the team in Israel says they found the animals will adjust their sounds toward a vocal label that\u2019s specific to their conversation partner.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s similar to names in humans,\u201d says David Omer, the neuroscientist who led the project. \u201cThere\u2019s a typical time structure to their calls, and what we report is that the monkey fine-tunes it to encode an individual.\u201d",
    "These names aren\u2019t really recognizable to the human ear; instead, they were identified via a \u201crandom forest,\u201d the statistical machine learning technique Omer\u2019s team used to cluster, classify, and analyze the sounds. Related StoryThe way whales communicate is closer to human language than we realizedA wave of new projects are taking us closer to understanding what whales are communicating to each other",
    "To prove they\u2019d cracked the monkey code\u2014and learned the secret names\u2014the team played recordings at the marmosets through a speaker and found they responded more often when their label, or name, was in the recording. This sort of research could provide clues to the origins of human language, which is arguably the most powerful innovation in our species\u2019 evolution, right up there with opposable thumbs. In years past, it\u2019s been argued that human language is unique and that animals lack both the brains and vocal apparatus to converse. But there\u2019s growing evidence that isn\u2019t the case, especially now that the use of names has been found in at least four distantly related species. \u201cThis is very strong evidence that the evolution of language was not a singular event,\u201d says Omer. Some similar research tactics were reported earlier this year by Mickey Pardo, a postdoctoral researcher, now at Cornell University, who spent 14 months in Kenya recording elephant calls. Elephants sound alarms by trumpeting, but in reality most of their vocalizations are deep rumbles that are only partly audible to humans. Pardo also found evidence that elephants use vocal labels, and he says he can definitely get an elephant\u2019s attention by playing the sound of another elephant addressing it. But does this mean researchers are now \u201cspeaking animal\u201d?\u00a0 Not quite, says Pardo. Real language, he thinks, would mean the ability to discuss things that happened in the past or string together more complex ideas. Pardo says he\u2019s hoping to determine next if elephants have specific sounds for\u00a0deciding which watering hole to visit\u2014that is, whether they employ place names. Several efforts are underway to discover if there\u2019s still more meaning in animal sounds than we thought. This year, a group called Project CETI that\u2019s studying the songs of sperm whales found they are far more complex than previously recognized. It means the animals, in theory, could be using a kind of grammar\u2014although whether they actually are saying anything specific isn\u2019t known.",
    "Another effort, the Earth Species Project, aims to use \u201cartificial intelligence to decode nonhuman communication\u201d and has started helping researchers collect more data on animal sounds to feed into those models.\u00a0 The team in Israel say they will also be giving the latest types of artificial intelligence a try. Their marmosets live in a laboratory facility, and Omer says he\u2019s already put microphones in monkeys\u2019 living space in order to record everything they say, 24 hours a day. Their chatter, Omer says, will be used to train a large language model that could, in theory, be used to\u00a0finish a series of calls that a monkey started, or produce what it predicts is an appropriate reply. But will a primate language model actually make sense, or will it just gibber away without meaning?\u00a0 Only the monkeys will be able to say for sure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t have any delusional expectations that they will talk about Nietzsche,\u201d says Omer. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be extremely complex like a human, but I would expect it to help us understand something about how our language developed.\u201d\u00a0 hide"
