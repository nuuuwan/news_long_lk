Sri Lanka's proposed Economic Transformation Bill, aimed at meeting targets set by International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, poses a potential threat to the country's sovereignty, argues this opinion piece. The critique alleges that the Sri Lankan government wants to enshrine IMF-mandated austerity measures into national law, effectively ceding control of national economic policy to the Washington-based institutions. The bill, which promotes "export-oriented growth" and modernises agriculture, has sparked concerns over potential neglect of local farming communities and the goal of food self-sufficiency. The piece also suggests that manipulated financial targets, such as a primary budget surplus of 2.3% of GDP, are implemented mainly to appease creditors rather than promote economic growth.
