Sri Lanka has a low number of entrepreneurs compared to neighbouring countries India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Thailand. This is due to a lack of cultural recognition of the importance of entrepreneurship, with parents often steering their children towards traditional professions. To address this, the government has introduced 'industry entrepreneurship circles' to the national school system to encourage children to develop an entrepreneurial mindset. Already, over 400 schools and 13,000 students nationwide are participating in the initiative, with plans to expand further. The circles are part of a wider plan to update the country's education system and create an entrepreneurial culture, ultimately helping to drive economic growth in Sri Lanka.
