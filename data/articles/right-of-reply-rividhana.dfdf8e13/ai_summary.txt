In response to a Daily Mirror article that raised concerns about the awarding of a solar project to a consortium, Rividhanavi (Private) Limited has issued a rebuttal, denying all allegations. The solar project, valued at over $125 million, includes a 100MW Solar Power Plant and a Transmission Facility featuring a 27km 132kV Transmission line and a 132kV Grid Substation with a power capacity of 100MW. The selection process was a two-envelope system requiring separate technical and financial offers. "Technical Offer" is evaluated first and "Financial Offer" is only evaluated for those who passed the technical evaluation. Rividhanavi said they were the only qualified bidder, so only their financial offer was made public. The consortium claimed to meet and exceed all financial requirements stipulated in the tender document.
