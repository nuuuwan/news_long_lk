In Sri Lanka, there are 6.1 million households, with estimates suggesting that approximately 700,000 additional housing units are needed. This figure includes 45,000 slums, 280,000 temporary structures, 390,000 partially completed structures, and 840,000 non-plastered homes. There are about 213,000 homeless families, and another 165,000 homeless families who own land. The information was sourced from the Central Bank Report 2023 and the Construction Journal 2024. 

Providing housing for these people will cost around $5 billion, with 100,000 of these homes planned for completion in the next 5 years, at a total cost of $700 million. The author suggests the Sri Lanka government stop investing money in a new airport at Hingurakgoda and halt borrowing for the development of roads and irrigation so that funds can be redirected to housing. 

To raise the required funds, the author proposes the government secure grants from India, the Middle East, China, Japan, the UNDP, Save the Children, and other private and philanthropic entities. Additionally, concessionary loans from the ADB, World Bank, and JICA, which offer favorable terms like 40-year repayment periods, 10-year grace periods, and interest rates under 1% per annum, could be procured. 

The construction aspect of this project will be a significant challenge. However, with proper planning and implementation, the 700,000 unit housing program can improve the quality of life for many low-income families, leading to broader economic benefits for the country.
