    "Obtain grants from UNDP, Save the Children, and other donor organisations for the low income housing program which is to minimise poverty;",

    "If the Financing Plan above is used, then financing the program will not be a problem although SL has a current financial problem. The constraint here is the construction activity. Construction of 100,000 houses in five years is also not easy in terms of its physical workload and to manage a mega construction effort.",
    "The program could be for a 700,000 housing units in the long term and 100,000 houses in the next 5 years.",
    "Key economic benefit is that once a poor family gets a house, then they become a low, middle-income status household; e.g. see the families living in Govt. gifted housing units. They are not in poverty anymore;",
    "The cause of all revolutions is poverty. This program will minimise the poverty level;",
    "It is co`mmendable for all Govts since 1980s for having constructed nearly 1.5 million houses for low-income families. This effort should continue to minimise the poverty level in SL;",
    "$ 700 million for five years to construct 100,000 houses is not a significant amount. In 2024, the Govt. took over $ 500 million debt owed by SriLankan Airlines. Construction of 100,000 houses in five years is well spent on a worthy cause. A part of it could come as a grant from various sources.",
