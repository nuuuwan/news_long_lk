Sri Lanka's tourism sector has shown a marked recovery in Q1 2024 after the pandemic, with nearly double the tourist arrivals compared to the same period a year earlier. The total number of tourists within the first three months of 2024 was 0.65 million, accounting for 42% of the total visitors for the previous year. This resurgence was due to strategic tourism promotion, improved infrastructure, and welcoming visa policies. The Lankan economy, which suffered heavy losses and a sharp depreciation of its currency due to the pandemic, is also showing signs of stabilisation. The potential for increased tourism from South Asia is immense, as the first quarter of 2024 saw 115,280 tourists from the region. To fully capitalise on this potential, Sri Lanka needs to work on improving regional air connectivity, streamlining travel procedures, and promoting joint tourism initiatives.
