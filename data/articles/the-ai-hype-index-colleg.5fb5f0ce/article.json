    "Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn\u2019t always easy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created the AI Hype Index\u2014a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry. Large language models confidently present their responses as accurate and reliable, even when they\u2019re neither of those things. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve recently seen chatbots supercharge vulnerable people\u2019s delusions, make citation mistakes in an important legal battle between music publishers and Anthropic, and (in the case of xAI\u2019s Grok) rant irrationally about \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d  But it\u2019s not all bad news\u2014AI could also finally lead to a better battery life for your iPhone and solve tricky real-world problems that humans have been struggling to crack, if Google DeepMind\u2019s new model is any indication. And perhaps most exciting of all, it could combine with brain implants to help people communicate when they have lost the ability to speak. hide"
