Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn’t always easy. That’s why we’ve created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry. Large language models confidently present their responses as accurate and reliable, even when they’re neither of those things. That’s why we’ve recently seen chatbots supercharge vulnerable people’s delusions, make citation mistakes in an important legal battle between music publishers and Anthropic, and (in the case of xAI’s Grok) rant irrationally about “white genocide.”  But it’s not all bad news—AI could also finally lead to a better battery life for your iPhone and solve tricky real-world problems that humans have been struggling to crack, if Google DeepMind’s new model is any indication. And perhaps most exciting of all, it could combine with brain implants to help people communicate when they have lost the ability to speak. hide
