    "What\u2019s happened?On April 28th the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada won a fourth consecutive general election, ensuring that the prime minister and Liberal Party leader, Mark Carney, remains in office. This is a remarkable political comeback for the Liberals; after long trailing the opposition Conservative Party, they leapt into first place in the polls after the US president, Donald Trump, began escalating tensions with Canada over sovereignty and trade issues. Political challenges remain, with the failure of the\u00a0Liberals to secure a parliamentary majority meaning that Mr\u00a0Carney, similar to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, is set to lead a minority government that is reliant on the support of other\u00a0parties.Why does it matter?Much like the election campaign, which was dominated by Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s tariff and annexation threats, Mr\u00a0Carney\u2019s success over his four-year term will hinge on his ability to navigate the escalating trade war with the US.\u00a0We continue to expect that Mr\u00a0Carney will adopt an assertive stance on trade but will moderate his public rhetoric to avoid the risk of escalating the dispute. He is likely to focus on an incremental approach to securing tariff rollbacks from the US, starting with autos. Along with the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr\u00a0Carney will need to quickly establish an approach to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) renegotiation, scheduled to begin in July\u00a02026.Domestically, the first Carney budget is likely to introduce fiscal measures targeting middle- and low-income households, including GST relief for home-buyers and targeted tax cuts.\u00a0Increasing defence spending will also be a priority.\u00a0Canada faces mounting pressure from the US to meet NATO\u2019s defence spending target of 2% of GDP. Mr\u00a0Carney has pledged to allocate C$30.9bn over the next four years to bolster Canada\u2019s defence capabilities, with a particular focus on strengthening its northern borders in response to rising Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic. He has committed to meeting NATO spending goals by 2030, two years earlier than previously\u00a0pledged by Mr\u00a0Trudeau.Mr Carney\u2019s ability to pursue his agenda will be tested by some challenging parliamentary arithmetic.\u00a0In the 343-seat House of Commons, the Liberals will need to maintain internal discipline and secure support from other parties to pass budgets and legislation. With the New Democratic Party, which previously supported Mr\u00a0Trudeau\u2019s government, losing seats in the election, Mr\u00a0Carney will probably need to reach out to Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, suggesting some concessions on issues tied to Quebec autonomy. Although we expect Mr\u00a0Carney to enjoy some initial parliamentary goodwill in the light of US trade threats, political stability will be tested as the economic downturn that we expect becomes more pronounced. The Conservatives, despite falling short of victory, have formed a robust opposition, and we believe that they will continue to champion cost-of-living issues and push back against Liberal\u00a0policies.What next?Mr Carney will prioritise managing the economic fallout from Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s tariffs on key sectors including automobiles, steel and aluminium, with additional levies on auto parts threatened from May\u00a02nd.\u00a0We expect him to initiate immediate negotiations with the Trump administration on a new economic and security arrangement.\u00a0His government is likely to pursue stronger trade ties with other partners, particularly the EU, to diversify Canada\u2019s economic\u00a0relationships.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
