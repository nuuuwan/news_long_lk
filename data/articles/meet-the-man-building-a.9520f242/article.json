    "You live in a house you designed and built yourself. You rely on the sun for power, heat your home with a woodstove, and farm your own fish and vegetables. The year is 2025.\u00a0 This is the life of Marcin Jakubowski, the 53-year-old founder of Open Source Ecology, an open collaborative of engineers, producers, and builders developing what they call the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). It\u2019s a set of 50 machines\u2014everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker\u2014that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit.\u00a0  Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the \u201cprosperity of technology\u201d was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States.\u00a0 Related StoryThe quest to figure out farming on MarsIf we\u2019re going to live on Mars we\u2019ll need a way to grow food in its arid dirt. Researchers think they know a way.",
    "With a bachelor\u2019s degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school. While his peers kick-started their shiny new corporate careers, he followed a different path after he finished his degree in 2003: He bought a tractor to start a farm in Maysville, Missouri, eager to prove his ideas about abundance. \u201cIt was a clear decision to give up the office cubicle or high-level research job, which is so focused on tiny issues that one never gets to work on the big picture,\u201d he says. But in just a short few months, his tractor broke down\u2014and he soon went broke.",
    "Every time his tractor malfunctioned, he had no choice but to pay John Deere for repairs\u2014even if he knew how to fix the problem on his own. John Deere, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, continues to prohibit farmers from repairing their own tractors (except in Colorado, where farmers were granted a right to repair by state law in 2023). Fixing your own tractor voids any insurance or warranty, much like jailbreaking your iPhone.\u00a0 Today, large agricultural manufacturers have centralized control over the market, and most commercial tractors are built with proprietary parts. Every year, farmers pay $1.2 billion in repair costs and lose an estimated $3 billion whenever their tractors break down, entirely because large agricultural manufacturers have lobbied against the right to repair since the \u201990s. Currently there are class action lawsuits involving hundreds of farmers fighting for their right to do so.",
    "\u201cThe machines own farmers. The farmers don\u2019t own [the machines],\u201d Jakubowski says. He grew certain that self-sufficiency relied on agricultural autonomy, which could be achieved only through free access to technology. So he set out to apply the principles of open-source software to hardware. He figured that if farmers could have access to the instructions and materials required to build their own tractors, not only would they be able to repair them, but they\u2019d also be able to customize the vehicles for their needs. Life-changing technology should be available to all, he thought, not controlled by a select few. So, with an understanding of mechanical engineering, Jakubowski built his own tractor and put all his schematics online on his platform Open Source Ecology.\u00a0\u00a0 That tractor Jakubowski built is designed to be taken apart. It\u2019s a critical part of the GVCS, a collection of plug-and-play machines that can \u201cbuild a thriving economy anywhere in the world \u2026 from scratch.\u201d The GVCS includes a 3D printer, a self-contained hydraulic power unit called the Power Cube, and more, each designed to be reconfigured for multiple purposes. There\u2019s even a GVCS micro-home. You can use the Power Cube to power a brick press, a sawmill, a car, a CNC mill, or a bioplastic extruder, and you can build wind turbines with the frames that are used in the home.\u00a0 Jakubowski compares the GVCS to Lego blocks and cites the Linux ecosystem as his inspiration. In the same way that Linux\u2019s source code is free to inspect, modify, and redistribute, all the instructions you need to build and repurpose a GVCS machine are freely accessible online. Jakubowski envisions a future in which the GVCS parallels the Linux infrastructure, with custom tools built to optimize agriculture, construction, and material fabrication in localized contexts. \u201cThe [final form of the GVCS] must be proven to allow efficient production of food, shelter, consumer goods, cars, fuel, and other goods\u2014except for exotic imports (coffee, bananas, advanced semiconductors),\u201d he wrote on his Open Source Ecology wiki.\u00a0 The ethos of GVCS is reminiscent of the Whole Earth Catalog, a countercultural publication that offered a combination of reviews, DIY manuals, and survival guides between 1968 and 1972. Founded by Stewart Brand, the publication had the slogan \u201cAccess to tools\u201d and was famous for promoting self-sufficiency. It heavily featured the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term \u201cephemeralization,\u201d which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort.\u00a0  The schematics for Marcin Jakubowski's designs are all available online.COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY   Jakubowski owns the publication\u2019s entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. \u201cThe first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet\u2014Fuller patented his stuff,\u201d he says. Fuller and the Whole Earth Catalog may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. \u201cThe failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,\u201d he says.\u00a0  With a background in physics and an understanding of mechanical engineering, Marcin Jakubowski built his own tractor.COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY   Unlike software, hardware can\u2019t be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints\u2014different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology \u201cappropriate.\u201d\u00a0 Appropriate technology is technology that\u2019s designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of swadeshi (self-reliance) and sarvodaya (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich \u201cFritz\u201d Schumacher\u2019s book Small Is Beautiful, which discussed the concept of \u201cintermediate technology\u201d: \u201cAny intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius\u2014and a lot of courage\u2014to move in the opposite direction.\u201d Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-\u00adpowered water pumps\u2014anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community\u2014are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology.\u00a0 Related StoryAI is changing how we study bird migrationAfter decades of frustration, machine-learning tools are unlocking a treasure trove of acoustic data for ecologists.",
    "This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation.",
    "What makes Jakubowski\u2019s technology \u201cappropriate\u201d is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he\u2019s able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow. Everything you need to build Jakubowski\u2019s machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online\u2014from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a wrench, you\u2019ve got a tractor,\u201d his manual reads.\u00a0\u00a0 This spirit dates back to the \u201970s, when the idea of building things \u201cmoved out of the retired person\u2019s garage and into the young person\u2019s relationship with the Volkswagen,\u201d says Brand. He references John Muir\u2019s 1969 book How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot and fondly recalls how the Beetle\u2019s simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression.\u00a0 For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were \u201cappropriate\u201d in Jakubowski\u2019s terms, Brand says: \u201cA century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.\u201d The company \u201cattracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,\u201d Brand says, but \u201cthey\u2019ve really reversed the orientation.\u201d Echoing Jakubowski\u2019s initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable.\u00a0  Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe\u2019s, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places.\u00a0 Of the many machines developed, what\u2019s drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed \u201cThe Liberator,\u201d which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs\u2014a type of cost- and energy-\u00adefficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It\u2019s been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aur\u00e9lien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize.\u00a0  The CEB press, nicknamed \u201cThe Liberator,\u201d turns local soil into energy-efficient compressed earth blocks.COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY   Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: \u201cWhen [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.\u201d Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. \u201cI had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,\u201d he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. \u201cPretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.\u201d\u00a0 Related StoryMeet the economist who wants the field to account for natureGretchen Daily is working to make the environment more of an element in economic decision-making.",
    "Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees. Spina spent five years building versions of the GVCS tractor and Power Cube, eager to create means of self-\u00adsufficiency at an individual scale. \u201cI\u2019m building my own tractor because I want to understand it and be able to maintain it,\u201d he wrote in his blog, Machining Independence. Spina\u2019s curiosity gestures toward the broader issue of technological literacy: The more we outsource to proprietary tech, the less we understand how things work\u2014further entrenching our need for that proprietary tech. Transparency is critical to the open-source philosophy precisely because it helps us become self-sufficient.",
    "Since starting Open Source Ecology, Jakubowski has been the main architect behind the dozens of machines available on his platform, testing and refining his designs on a plot of land he calls the Factor\u00a0e Farm in Maysville. Most GVCS enthusiasts reproduce Jakubowski\u2019s machines for personal use; only a few have contributed to the set themselves. Of those select few, many made dedicated visits to the farm for weeks at a time to learn how to build Jakubowski\u2019s GVCS collection. James Wise, one of the earliest and longest-term GVCS contributors, recalls setting up tents and camping out in his car to attend sessions at Jakubowski\u2019s workshop, where visiting enthusiasts would gather to iterate on designs: \u201cWe\u2019d have a screen on the wall of our current best idea. Then we\u2019d talk about it.\u201d Wise doesn\u2019t consider himself particularly experienced on the engineering front, but after working with other visiting participants, he felt more emboldened to contribute. \u201cMost of [my] knowledge came from [my] peers,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Jakubowski\u2019s goal of bolstering collaboration hinges on a degree of collective proficiency. Without a community skilled with hardware, the organic innovation that the open-source approach promises will struggle to bear fruit, even if Jakubowski\u2019s designs are perfectly appropriate and thoroughly documented.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re starting a school!\u201d said Jakubowski, when asked about his plan to build hardware literacy. Earlier this year, he announced the Future Builders Academy, an apprenticeship program where participants will be taught all the necessary skills to develop and build the affordable, self-sustaining homes that are his newest venture. Seed Eco Homes, as Jakubowski calls them, are \u201chuman-sized, panelized\u201d modular houses complete with a biodigester, a thermal battery, a geothermal cooling system, and solar electricity. Each house is entirely energy independent and can be built in five days, at a cost of around $40,000. Over eight of these houses have been built across the country, and Jakubowski himself lives in the earliest version of the design. Seed Eco Homes are the culmination of his work on the GVCS: The structure of each house combines parts from the collection and embodies its modular philosophy. The venture represents Jakubowski\u2019s larger goal of making everyday technology accessible. \u201cHousing [is the] single largest cost in one\u2019s life\u2014and a key to so much more,\u201d he says. The final goal of Open Source Ecology is a \u201czero marginal cost\u201d society, where producing an additional unit of a good or service costs little to nothing. Jakubowski\u2019s interpretation of the concept (popularized by the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin) assumes that by eradicating licensing fees, decentralizing manufacturing, and fostering collaboration through education, we can develop truly equitable technology that allows us to be self-sufficient. Open-source hardware isn\u2019t just about helping farmers build their own tractors; in Jakubowski\u2019s view, it\u2019s a complete reorientation of our relationship to technology.\u00a0 In the first issue of the Whole Earth Catalog, a key piece of inspiration for Jakubowski\u2019s project, Brand wrote: \u201cWe are as gods and we might as well get good at it.\u201d In 2007, in a book Brand wrote about the publication, he corrected himself: \u201cWe are as gods and have to get good at it.\u201d Today, Jakubowski elaborates: \u201cWe\u2019re becoming gods with technology. Yet technology has badly failed us. We\u2019ve seen great progress with civilization. But how free are people today compared to other times?\u201d Cautioning against our reliance on the proprietary technology we use daily, he offers a new approach: Progress should mean not just achieving technological breakthroughs but also making everyday technology equitable.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t need more technology,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need to collaborate with what we have now.\u201d Tiffany Ng is a freelance writer exploring the relationship between art, tech, and culture.
