The writer discusses the ongoing debate about the pricing of electricity in Sri Lanka, particularly the prices approved by Cabinet for the Adani project. They stress that sometimes higher pricing is necessary to support investment and infrastructure, as shown by their own past experience as Director General of Telecommunications where they increased charges to support revenue and allow for investment. They insist that both decisions and criticisms need to be rigorously questioned and examined to ensure transparency and proper evidence-based decision-making. The writer also emphasises the need for local cost benchmarks as foreign ones may not accurately reflect Sri Lanka's unique context.
