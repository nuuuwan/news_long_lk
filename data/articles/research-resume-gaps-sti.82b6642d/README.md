# Research: Resume Gaps Still Matter

## Summary ü§ñ

1. üëÄ Attitudes towards resume gaps seem to be shifting. Open conversations and LinkedIn's new 'Career Breaks' feature are evidence of this.
2. üëæ The Covid-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment, which may have influenced these changing attitudes.
3. ‚ú® Gen Z, who will make up the majority of the workforce by 2035, have a less negative view of work gaps.
4. üí¨ Sharing career interruptions on social media has normalized these gaps. 
5. üó£Ô∏è Career coaches encourage honesty about resume gaps and emphasize non-workplace learning experiences.
6. üò≤ A 2019 Experiment by ResumeGo showed an 11% callback rate for resumes with no gaps, and a 10% rate for 1-2 year gaps. Callback rates dropped sharply for longer gaps.
7. üë• A 2023 LinkedIn poll shows 61% managers still view resume gaps negatively.
8. üí∞ Research showed a 14% pay rise for job moves for those with a gap, compared to a 22% pay rise for those without.
9. üë®‚Äçüíºüë©‚Äçüíº Resume gaps have different impacts on men and women. Women are consistently penalized for job gaps, while men face penalties only during job switches.
10. üßê The research suggests that while resume gaps are not entirely career-ending, they do have an impact on hiring and compensation, especially for those who are early in their careers.

Without knowing the details of a person‚Äôs history, employers rely on signals of quality to make bets on who will make quality employees with a strong organizational fit. Resume gaps used to be clear negative signals, but attitudes seem to be changing...more

Attitudes toward resume gaps seem to be changing. While they once were considered a serious red flag for job candidates, today we‚Äôre seeing more people talking openly and without reservation about taking a break from employment. A 2022 LinkedIn survey of 23,000 global workers indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents indicated that they had taken some sort of career break. LinkedIn released this survey data while introducing a new ‚ÄúCareer Breaks‚Äù feature, allowing its users to showcase non-employment experiences and skills acquired during a professional pause.

There are a number of reasons behind this cultural shift. First, during the pandemic, we witnessed an unprecedented spike in unemployment. Many firms shed their workforce to cope with sudden drops in demand, and some workers had to quickly shift to caregiving roles in light of school shutdowns and disruptions to health care delivery. Today, it seems that nearly everyone knows someone who has experienced a pandemic-related business or employment disruption.

Second, studies of Gen Z attitudes indicate a less negative, perhaps even a positive perspective, on work gaps. Making up nearly one-third of the current global workforce, Gen Z will comprise the largest representation of the workforce by 2035. It stands to reason if generational differences explain greater openness to less traditional career tracks, this effect will only become more amplified.

Third, the openness of sharing career interruptions on social media platforms has become a mainstream phenomenon. Ranging from calculated, professional announcements aiming to solicit new job offers to raw, emotional hot takes, today‚Äôs professionals appear ready to share their experiences in ways that seem unimaginable in the not-to-distant past.

With more open communication about career gaps, coaches and consultants have quickly moved in to provide renewed advice on handling job disruptions. Such guidance stresses the importance of being truthful about gaps and the reasons behind it ‚Äî honesty remains the best policy. Additionally, some recommend highlighting learning experiences that have taken place outside the workplace.

With all this evidence, it‚Äôs tempting to conclude that resume gaps are worries of the past ‚Äî but to do so ignores some important data about hiring behaviors.

The Impact of a Resume Gap on Hiring

To understand the stigma around resume gaps, ResumeGo conducted a field experiment in 2019. Researchers created several fictitious applicants with varying resume gaps for more than 36,000 openings posted on popular job boards. They found resumes with no gaps received a call-back rate of more than 11%, while resumes with one or two-year gaps received about a 10% call-back rate. After that, the callback rates dropped significantly: Three, four, and five-year gaps had respective callback rates of 4.6%, 3.7%, and 3.1%.

Context matters, and while giving reasons for work pauses did not fully recover the gap penalty, it did provide some attenuation, depending on the reason. While the average resume gap applicant with no given reason received only a 4.3% callback rate, this jumped to an 8.5% callback rate when the reason provided was training and education. Health issues had about a 7% callback rate, and family concerns had almost a 6% callback rate.

To understand how much attitudes have changed in recent years, we polled more than 400 managers on LinkedIn in the fall of 2023. Their responses provide some additional reasons to be skeptical of a major sea change: 61% of respondents still considered resume gaps to be a negative sign. Break down the rationale for this, reliability was the top concern (29%), followed by motivation (27%), retention risk (25%), and skill atrophy (19%).

Our data also revealed some gender differences in how people viewed resume gaps. About 60% both men and women responded that resume gaps were negative signals. Of the 40% who did not see it as a negative sign, 10% of men thought that resume gaps were a positive signal and 30% thought there was no impact. For women, only 4% thought that resume gaps were a positive signal.

The Impact of a Resume Gap on Pay

Not being hired is only one way resume gaps can hurt employment prospects. We also wanted to understand: Do those with resume gaps receive less pay than those without them?

To answer this, we needed to find good compensation data during a period with similar economic pressures. Using data gathered on job transitioning executives between 2004 and 2011 ‚Äî a period that included the Great Recession ‚Äî we identified which executives had resume gaps and which did not. In addition to accounting for a global employment shock, our data allows us to zero in on the effect of gaps at the time job seekers are most vulnerable: when changing companies.

Similar to the results on callbacks, we found a general negative effect for resume gaps and some important governing contextual factors:

1. Resume gaps have a measurable negative impact on compensation.

Our data showed that when moving jobs, those with a resume gap experience a 14% pay raise, but those without gaps have a 22% pay raise. Our approach allowed us to control for a host of job seeker factors (education, years of experience), employer factors (region, size, industry), and job role factors (functional area). Additionally, we were able to account for any time-invariant, unobserved individual-level attributes that could impact pay levels.

2. Resume gaps‚Äô negative impact accrues for younger executives.

Those in senior roles, such as presidents and CXOs, do not experience this negative effect in a reliably measurable way. This makes sense, since more senior executives have a longer and richer work history from which firms can base hiring decisions. Those who are earlier in their careers are less proven; as such, the negative signal from professional gaps is more influential.

3. The impact also depends on the hiring firm.

We found that the negative compensation effect for resume gaps is confined to large firms, those with greater than 1,000 employees. Smaller firms do not show measurable negative effects. Smaller firms also may not have the same access to labor markets as large firms, requiring them to be less discriminating.

4. The resume gap impact affects men and women differently.

For each executive, our data captures pay at two different employers ‚Äî the company that the executive is moving from and the company that the executive is moving to. Among women, our research found a 9% pay penalty for those with resume gaps. This penalty exists both at the company the executive is moving from and the company the executive is moving to. It seems that for women, the negative effects of resume gaps persist.

For men, it is a different story ‚Äî the resume gap penalty appears only when measuring pay in the context of a move. This suggests that negative effects occur only during a job switch.

This subtle difference is intriguing. It suggests that while women may be consistently penalized for job attachment problems, men may be able to diminish this negative impact through demonstrated performance at an employer. The negative impact comes only during a move, when the job history is reconsidered afresh by a new employer.

By carefully studying the data, something more nuanced and grounded comes into focus. It is not that resume gaps are a career death sentence, nor is it the case that they are irrelevant to career outcomes. Circumstances matter, and the extent to which such gaps can be explained may in some cases mitigate negative effects, but not completely.

On the outcome of pay, there is a similar complicated story. Overall, resume gaps hurt compensation; however, not all job movers are affected in the same way. Those with longer, richer demonstrations of their capabilities have less to be concerned with, whereas those who are building their careers are more vulnerable. Bigger companies that are more likely governed by hiring guidelines may be less likely to depart from traditional interpretations of career gaps. Finally, the impact of career gaps may impact men and women differently.

Hiring has always been a situation of uncertainty. Employers are looking for good candidates, but without knowing the details of a person‚Äôs history, they rely on signals of quality to make bets on who will make quality employees with a strong organizational fit. Even the most detailed resume will not reveal the entire story. As such, hiring managers make their best efforts to make decisions based on available information.

Resume gaps used to be clear negative signals. Today, they fall short of telling the whole story of a potential hire‚Äôs work ethic, reliability, and employment readiness. But this was an unclear picture in the past, too. Our current work environment doesn‚Äôt change the fact that hiring managers are still trying to sort out good hiring decisions with incomplete information and are using imperfect signals as inputs.

The perceived greater prevalence of those with resume gaps may provide some social proof that this is more typical than it was before. But the research presented here suggests resume gaps are still seen as a signal of candidate quality. As more people are affected by involuntary work pauses, those without them may be seen as an even more selective group. In this way, a greater prevalence of those with resume gaps could increase the pay gap rather than ameliorate it.
