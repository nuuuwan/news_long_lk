    "Only 15% of managers consistently use gen AI, but 40% of business graduate students do. These managers and leaders of the near future will soon enter a workforce that is underprepared for them and poorly designed for them to put their abilities to use. This article explores how organizations should respond. Companies should learn to become a magnet for gen AI-savvy talent, and discover how to best onboard, engage, integrate, and retain the next generation of AI-capable managers.",
