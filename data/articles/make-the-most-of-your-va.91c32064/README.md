Although working during vacation isn’t ideal, there may be times when projects, deadlines, or client obligations prevent you from being fully offline. While it’s not easy to balance these competing priorities, it is possible to get critical work done while enjoying some refreshing time off. The key is to do a little pre-planning, making sure to avoid a few common mistakes people make when mixing business and personal travel. The author presents five pitfalls to avoid on your working vacation — and what to do instead.
