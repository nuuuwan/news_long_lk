Four Sri Lankans, accused of smuggling gold and drugs, were arrested at Ahmadabad Airport in India. Sri Lanka's state intelligence are investigating whether the individuals are linked to ISIS. However, no evidence of such connections have been found to date. A self-proclaimed terrorist expert, Rohan Gunaratne, controversially announced that the four individuals were ISIS agents before India's official investigation had begun. The author of the article criticises Gunaratne for his premature assumptions and accusation, and questions his possible bias against the perpetrators due to their Muslim background. The article urges that recognition and action be taken against the violence committed by other entities such as Israel, US, and Europe, rather than solely focusing on Islamic terror organisations. It also stresses the need for unity during the economic crisis Sri Lanka is currently facing, and highlights Muslims' peaceful cohabitation in their communities.
