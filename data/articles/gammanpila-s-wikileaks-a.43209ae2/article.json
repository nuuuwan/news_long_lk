    "Contrary to public expectations, what was\u00a0 revealed on Monday failed to expose the so-called \u2018Master Brain\u2019 or\u00a0 behind-the-scenes machinations and cover-ups",
    "His reputation for theatrics and political manoeuvring suggests\u00a0 that this could also be a calculated attempt to gain public interest or\u00a0 is this yet another strategy to keep himself in the spotlight during a\u00a0 crucial election season",
    "As Gammanpila contests the upcoming parliamentary elections,\u00a0 there are suggestions that he may use this as a card to draw attention\u00a0 to his campaign or apply political pressure",
    "\u201cSecrecy, being an instrument of conspiracy, ought never to be the system of regular government.\u201d Jeremy Bentham-English Philosopher, Jurist:1839",
    "Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks exposed confidential documents\u00a0 in 2010, sparking unprecedented controversy and leading to intense\u00a0 scrutiny of American involvement in foreign conflicts. In Sri Lanka,\u00a0 certain opposition politicians, particularly those associated with\u00a0 previous administrations responsible for the country\u2019s earlier political\u00a0 and economic mismanagement, have begun a relentless mud-slinging\u00a0 campaign against the newly elected President and his small cabinet. As\u00a0 the deadline for the exposure approached its final 24 hours, the\u00a0 President, addressing a well-attended election rally, spoke about\u00a0 looming threats and attempts to discredit his government.",
    "Gammanpila, after much speculation and curiosity, with\u00a0 whispers about the possible exposure of sensitive information related to\u00a0 the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, has implicated not only the new\u00a0 administration but also the previous government. The government does not\u00a0 \u201chide facts\u201d; they are simply not obliged to divulge all information\u00a0 immediately. The most guileless reason is that revelation could\u00a0 compromise national security or risk lives. The million-dollar question\u00a0 arising from his revelation is why both Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s and Anura\u00a0 Kumara\u2019s governments hesitated to publish the reports. The second case\u00a0 is clear: the commission\u2019s findings have caused serious embarrassment.\u00a0 Appointments to two vital positions in Law and Order, including the\u00a0 highest in the hierarchy, reportedly went to questionable individuals if\u00a0 the findings are accurate.",
    "The law requires the government to disclose information to\u00a0 the public upon request unless such information falls within one of nine\u00a0 narrow exemptions.",
    "He has opened only one-half of the \u201cPandora\u2019s Box,\u201d which,\u00a0 according to Udaya, requires more time for debate on the issues it\u00a0 contains. He announced a break before airing the final episode of the\u00a0 \u201cEaster Papers\u201d next Monday. Contrary to public expectations, what was\u00a0 revealed on Monday failed to expose the so-called \u2018Master Brain\u2019 or\u00a0 behind-the-scenes machinations and cover-ups. Instead, it focused on\u00a0 drastic lapses by the intelligence and CID, directly accusing the\u00a0 current Ministry Secretary, Ravi Seneviratne, and Shani Abeysekara\u2014both\u00a0 of whom, as retired men, appeared on the JVP/NPP stage during the\u00a0 campaign. As Gammanpila contests the upcoming parliamentary elections,\u00a0 there are suggestions that he may use this as a card to draw attention\u00a0 to his campaign or apply political pressure.",
    "Whether he has truly exposed the \u201cEaster Papers\u201d remains\u00a0 unclear, as such a move would have far-reaching consequences, not just\u00a0 for those implicated, but for the broader political establishment.\u00a0 However, his reputation for theatrics and political manoeuvring suggests\u00a0 that this could also be a calculated attempt to gain public interest or\u00a0 is this yet another strategy to keep himself in the spotlight during a\u00a0 crucial election season?",
    "Udaya and Champika, both of whom rose to prominence by\u00a0 championing a chauvinist agenda, along with Wimal Weerawansa, are now\u00a0 fading into political obscurity. Their past reliance on language-based,\u00a0 ultra-nationalist, and racist slogans to stir emotional fervour has\u00a0 proven ineffective in the face of changing public sentiment. The\u00a0 electorate\u2019s rejection of these divisive tactics reflects a broader\u00a0 shift toward more inclusive and pragmatic politics, where issues like\u00a0 economic development, social justice, and good governance take\u00a0 precedence over racial or ethnic divisions.",
    "The SJB and the rest having been relegated to the\u00a0 opposition\u2014the only arena where they seem to have secured a permanent\u00a0 place due to their failures\u2014are now attacking the new leadership over\u00a0 trivial or exaggerated issues. Their attempts to criticize often appear\u00a0 more like a desperate bid to stay relevant in the political sphere,\u00a0 rather than offering genuine solutions or meaningful critiques. This\u00a0 ongoing behaviour underscores their inability to move beyond past\u00a0 mistakes, choosing instead to undermine the efforts of the new\u00a0 administration without constructive engagement.",
    "Their criticism often lacks substance and not offering\u00a0 constructive alternatives or solutions. This behaviour highlights the\u00a0 ongoing polarization in Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape, where genuine\u00a0 debate often takes a backseat to personal attacks and partisan\u00a0 rivalries.",
    "Meanwhile, Udaya\u2019s former colleague, Champika Ranawaka, has\u00a0 opted for a well-deserved break from politics\u2014a hiatus that could\u00a0 signal a permanent farewell after numerous setbacks. At 60, Ranawaka\u2019s\u00a0 attempts to rejuvenate his political career through movements like the\u00a0 \u201c43rd Brigade\u201d and \u201cRepublican...\u201d failed to gain traction. After a\u00a0 series of unsuccessful bids for the common candidate slot, he cut a\u00a0 sorry figure, unable to secure even a consolation parliamentary seat\u00a0 from either the JVP or the UNP. Consequently, Ranawaka found himself\u00a0 back in the Premadasa camp, underscoring his diminishing influence in\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s political arena. His retreat may mark the end of an era\u00a0 characterized by missteps and missed opportunities. Their once-dominant\u00a0 influence is waning. Their inability to evolve and meet the expectations\u00a0 of a more enlightened, forward-thinking voter base has left them behind\u00a0 in Sri Lanka\u2019s shifting political landscape. While they had once\u00a0 thrived on nationalist and chauvinist rhetoric, today\u2019s electorate\u00a0 demands more pragmatic leadership focused on real issues.",
    "They frequently quote the rhetoric and slogans used by the\u00a0 NPP/JVP alliance during the election campaign, employing a common\u00a0 propaganda tactic seen throughout Sri Lanka\u2019s electoral history. These\u00a0 empty promises, reminiscent of slogans like SLFP\u2019s \u201chanden haal\u201d (rice from the moon-1970) -- UNP\u2019s \u201ceta ata\u201d (eight pounds of grain free-1977), and JVP\u2019s \u201cRajapaksahoraa kaapu salli\u201d [$18 Billion back from Uganda-2024], are typical of the exaggerated claims made by political parties to win over voters.",
    "Magician, \u2026 & the \u2018Rabbit\u2019",
    "Has Udaya pulled a dead rabbit out of his hat? The public\u00a0 is eagerly wondering whether he can leverage the potential exposure of\u00a0 sensitive documents, particularly those that former President Ranil\u00a0 Wickremesinghe has allegedly kept under wraps for a couple of months.\u00a0 The secrets contained in the other report may reveal critical\u00a0 information regarding the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, including possible\u00a0 lapses in security and decision-making that could have led to the\u00a0 tragedy.",
    "The government has already entrusted the investigations of\u00a0 the Easter attacks to the two high-ranking controversial former cops.\u00a0 Can they win the confidence of the people?",
    "Moreover, the manner in which Gammanpila acquired these\u00a0 documents, which were reportedly kept in safe custody at the\u00a0 Presidential Secretariat, poses even more intriguing questions. How did\u00a0 he manage to gain access to such sensitive material, and what\u00a0 implications might this have for both his political ambitions and the\u00a0 broader political landscape? These billion-dollar questions reflect the\u00a0 public\u2019s desire for clarity and accountability, as citizens seek answers\u00a0 to the mysteries surrounding the Easter Papers and their implications\u00a0 for justice and governance in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u2018Even if it can be established that disclosing the\u00a0 information would cause substantial harm to a genuine interest, the\u00a0 information should still be divulged if the benefits of disclosure\u00a0 outweigh the potential harm\u2019--Principles on Right to Information"
