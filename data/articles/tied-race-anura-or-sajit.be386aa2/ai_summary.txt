Mexico has elected its first-ever female president, Dr Claudia Sheinbaum, in a landslide victory. A lifelong leftist, Sheinbaum is a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City who won the presidency with between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote. Her parents were student activists during Mexico's 1968 youth uprising and came from a Jewish background. She earned a PhD in energy engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Sheinbaum's economic doctrine points to a shift away from neoliberalism, in favour of a government that prioritises education, health, pensions, and a strategic role in industries such as energy.
