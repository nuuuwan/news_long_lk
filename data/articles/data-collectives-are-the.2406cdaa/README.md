The AI boom — and the growth of gen AI in particular — has introduced new points of conflict between employees and companies. Some of these have already started to play out, such as in the Writers Guild of America strike over how AI can and can’t be used in the entertainment industry. But others are still on the horizon. As AI becomes more integrated into business, high quality data for training AI becomes more valuable and a more important part of employees’ contribution. Companies need to navigate if and how employees will be compensated for their data, as well as questions such as who owns and controls that data. One potential solution is data cooperatives, an organizational model that enable individuals to pool their data with the purpose of gaining bargaining power with the companies analyzing their data. These have the potential to mutually benefit companies and employees, and build a positive, collaborative relationship around a potential future flashpoint in labor relations.

The impact of AI, and generative AI in particular, is being felt across industries. But while executives are excited about this technology’s potential, white collar workers are often wary about what it may mean for them, their jobs, and their futures. These differing perceptions are creating new tensions and presenting new challenges for both groups.
