Some of these have already started to play out, such as in the Writers Guild of America strike over how AI can and can\u2019t be used in the entertainment industry. But others are still on the horizon. As AI becomes more integrated into business, high quality data for training AI becomes more valuable and a more important part of employees\u2019 contribution. Companies need to navigate if and how employees will be compensated for their data, as well as questions such as who owns and controls that data. One potential solution is data cooperatives, an organizational model that enable individuals to pool their data with the purpose of gaining bargaining power with the companies analyzing their data. These have the potential to mutually benefit companies and employees, and build a positive, collaborative relationship around a potential future flashpoint in labor relations.",
