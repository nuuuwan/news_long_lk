The future of political campaigns in India may lie in social media platforms like YouTube. Amid the upheaval of the 2024 parliamentary elections, YouTube has emerged as a crucial communication platform, overshadowing traditional media. More Indians trust YouTube for news, turning to these channels for coverage. While some YouTube channels offer more sophisticated production, most are run by freelance content creators with a camera and a tripod. These channels provide coverage and debates that are more grounded and less biased than traditional media outlets. Despite the limitations and risks, YouTube platforms in India have a reach of up to 450 million active users. Opposition parties have gained tremendous followers on these platforms, with opposition YouTubers drawing an all-India audience by filling in gaps in pro-government reporting. However, the freedom currently enjoyed by the social media channels may not last long due to the Bharatiya Janata Party's attempt to delegitimise opposition social media and the proposed Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill, 2023.
