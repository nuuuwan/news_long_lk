    "Given its collective wealth, technologic sophistication, and spending, the United States should lead, not lag, the world in its healthcare performance. But based on 70 performance measures across five domains \u2014 access to care, health outcomes, administrative efficiency, care process, and equity \u2014 the United States came in last overall and last or next to last in four of these five broad areas of performance when compared to nine other high-income countries. Significant, but doable, changes \u2014 including closing remaining gaps in insurance coverage, limiting crippling out-of-pocket-expenditures, and reviving its failing primary care capabilities \u2014 would help close the gap.",
    "The United States has the worst-performing health system among all high-income countries. Even the best-performing U.S. states lag international comparators like France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia. To move the United States from laggard to leader will require significant \u2014 but doable \u2014 changes in its healthcare system, including closing remaining gaps in insurance coverage, limiting debilitating out-of-pocket-expenditures, and reviving its failing primary care capabilities.",
