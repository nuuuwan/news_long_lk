    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY One of the dominant storylines I\u2019ve been following through 2025 is electricity\u2014where and how demand is going up, how much it costs, and how this all intersects with that topic everyone is talking about: AI. Last week, the International Energy Agency released the latest version of the World Energy Outlook, the annual report that takes stock of the current state of global energy and looks toward the future. It contains some interesting insights and a few surprising figures about electricity, grids, and the state of climate change. So let\u2019s dig into some numbers, shall we?  We\u2019re in the age of electricity Energy demand in general is going up around the world as populations increase and economies grow. But electricity is the star of the show, with demand projected to grow by 40% in the next 10 years. China has accounted for the bulk of electricity growth for the past 10 years, and that\u2019s going to continue. But emerging economies outside China will be a much bigger piece of the pie going forward. And while advanced economies, including the US and Europe, have seen flat demand in the past decade, the rise of AI and data centers will cause demand to climb there as well.",
    "Air-conditioning is a major source of rising demand. Growing economies will give more people access to air-conditioning; income-driven AC growth will add about 330 gigawatts to global peak demand by 2035. Rising temperatures will tack on another 170 GW in that time. Together, that\u2019s an increase of over 10% from 2024 levels.\u00a0\u00a0 AI is a local story This year, AI has been the story that none of us can get away from. One number that jumped out at me from this report: In 2025, investment in data centers is expected to top $580 billion. That\u2019s more than the $540 billion spent on the global oil supply.",
    "It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the energy demands of AI are in the spotlight. One key takeaway is that these demands are vastly different in different parts of the world. Related StoryWhat will power AI's growth?Read next Data centers still make up less than 10% of the projected increase in total electricity demand between now and 2035. It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s far outweighed by sectors like industry and appliances, including air conditioners. Even electric vehicles will add more demand to the grid than data centers. But AI will be the factor for the grid in some parts of the world. In the US, data centers will account for half the growth in total electricity demand between now and 2030. And as we\u2019ve covered in this newsletter before, data centers present a unique challenge, because they tend to be clustered together, so the demand tends to be concentrated around specific communities and on specific grids. Half the data center capacity that\u2019s in the pipeline is close to large cities. Look out for a coal crossover As we ask more from our grid, the key factor that\u2019s going to determine what all this means for climate change is what\u2019s supplying the electricity we\u2019re using. As it stands, the world\u2019s grids still primarily run on fossil fuels, so every bit of electricity growth comes with planet-warming greenhouse-gas emissions attached. That\u2019s slowly changing, though. Together, solar and wind were the leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, overtaking coal for the first time. Coal use could peak and begin to fall by the end of this decade. Nuclear could play a role in replacing fossil fuels: After two decades of stagnation, the global nuclear fleet could increase by a third in the next 10 years. Solar is set to continue its meteoric rise, too. Of all the electricity demand growth we\u2019re expecting in the next decade, 80% is in places with high-quality solar irradiation\u2014meaning they\u2019re good spots for solar power. Ultimately, there are a lot of ways in which the world is moving in the right direction on energy. But we\u2019re far from moving fast enough. Global emissions are, once again, going to hit a record high this year. To limit warming and prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to remake our energy system, including electricity, and we need to do it faster.\u00a0 This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter.
