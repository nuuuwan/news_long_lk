*03:33 AM, Monday, February 24, 2025*

(Ms.Jayalalithaa Jayaram was born on February 24th 1948. This article  written in 2023 for the “Spotlight” film affairs column in the “Daily Financial Times” is  re-posted here to denote “Amma”s 77th Birth anniversary on 24 Feb 2025)

Tamil Nadu in South India is geographically  the closest Indian state to Sri Lanka. Tamil Nadu meaning Tamil country has a population of 72,147,030 according to the 2011 Census.  The state has spawned many colourful political personalities. Standing out among these figures is  actress -politico Jayalalithaa Jayaram who was elected as Tamil Nadu chief minister four times and served in that position for almost 16 years. The alluring actress turned powerful politician reigned over  India’s sixth largest state like a ‘boss lady”. She also ruled her party the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(AIADMK) in an autocratic manner.

Jayalalithaa  Jayaram passed away in December 2016. If the “Iron Butterfly” was among the living  now, she would have celebrated her 77th  birth anniversary on February 24th 2025. It is against this backdrop that  this week’s  “Political Pulse” Column   focuses   on Jayalalithaa  while drawing from my earlier writings about her.

Jayalalithaa led the AIADMK from 1989 until her death in 2016. She was elected four times in general elections  as Tamil Nadu Chief minister. She served three full terms  in 1991-96, 2001-06 and  2011- 16. However she had to step down as chief minister twice due to legal impediments  caused by charges of alleged corruption and acquisition of disproportionate assets against her. She   regained  her post as chief minister on both occasions.Jayalalithaa  was elected chief minister a fourth time in 2016 but fell ill and died a few months later in the same year. Had she not passed away, Jayalalithaa would have  definitely been convicted and imprisoned for corruption and forfeited her chief minister post. Death through illness spared her that ignominy.

“Amma” or “Boss Lady”

Notwithstanding the corruption charges, Jayalalithaa  was the sole repository of power in the  AIADMK administrations she presided over. AS chief minister, she was in practice the ruling deity of Tamil Nadu. Her followers, supporters and sycophants referred to her respectfully as “Amma” which means both mother and also   a superior woman. Amma is both an endearing as well as respectful form of address. In Tamil Nadu under Jayalalithaa rule , there was only one “Amma” and that was her. From state administered cheap food restaurants to privately run cinema halls  “Amma”was the brand name. Cardboard cut-outs and colouful posters hailing “Amma Jayalalithaa” dotted  the landscape of Tamil Nadu then . “Amma” or boss lady  was omnipresent and omnipotent.

Jayalalithaa usually kept  her party members and supporters at a distance. But when she triumphed  at an election Jayalalithaa allowed party members to  come up to her and offer their wishes and praises. This they did with gusto in a disgusting exhibition of servile sycophancy. Thousands of supporters  crawled  before their divine “Amma” and prostrated themselves at her feet. Jayalalithaa had Tamil Nadu at her feet metaphorically and also literally.

“Self-respect Movement”

Tamil Nadu was once the cradle of the “Suya mariyaathai Iyakkam” or the “Self – respect Movement. It was in essence a Dravidian revolt against perceived Aryan dominance in the form of Brahminism. Ironically  Dravidian Tamil Nadu fawned  at the feet of “Paappaathi” (Brahmin woman) Jayalalithaa without any semblance of self – respect.

Jayalalithaa was born on February 24, 1948 in Mysore in the Karnataka state of today.She is of Tamil Vaishnavite Brahmin Aiyengaar stock hailing from Srirangam in the Trichy district of Tamil Nadu state. Both her paternal and maternal grandparents relocated to the state of Karnataka which was formerly known as Mysore.  Her paternal grandfather was Dr. Narasimhan Rangachary who  served as the court physician to Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, who reigned as the Maharajah of Mysore from 1894 to 1940. Her maternal grandfather Rengasamy Aiyengar worked at Hindustan Aeronautics in Bangalore now Bengaluru..

Jayalalithaa’s father Jayaram was a wastrel who squandered the family fortune away through gambling and betting.  He died when Jayalalithaa was two. Jayalalithaa’s widowed  mother Vedavalli,  turned to acting in films  for a living. She adopted the screen name Sandhya.

Jayalalithaa herself was born in Melukote in the Pandavapura division of Mandya district in Karnataka.  She was given her grandmother’s name Koamalavalli at the time of birth. The name Jayalalithaa was adopted later when she became an actress.. It was derived from the names of two houses where she had  resided in Mysore. One was “Jaya Vilas” and the other “Lalitha Vilas”. Her name was originally spelled with one ‘a’ at the end. Later another ‘a’ was added for numerological reasons. Jayalalitha became Jayalalithaa. However, she was widely known by her pet name “Ammu”. In later years  “Ammu”  gave  way to “Amma,”

Proud of her Tamil Ethnicity

Since she was born in Karnataka there are many who think Jayalalithaa is a Kannadiga. She is however a “Thamizhachi” (Tamil woman), fiercely proud of her Tamil ethnicity and Tamil Nadu roots.An incident that occurred decades ago when Jayalalithaa was a film star without any involvement in politics illustrates both her courage and pride in being Tamil.

It was the year 1970. Jayalalithaa had agreed to perform with her dance troupe at an exhibition held at Bengaluru (then Bangalore) in Karnataka. Due to her shooting schedule going awry,  Jayalalithaa had to cancel the performance at the last minute. This led to Vatal Nagaraj, the leader of a Karnataka-based political outfit known as the “Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha,” issuing a statement condemning her for cancelling the event despite being a Kannadiga woman.

Vatal Nagaraj, a Kannadiga chauvinist, was a dreaded figure in Karnataka like Bal Thackeray of the Shiv Sena was in Maharashtra state. In spite of Vatal Nagaraj’s fearsome reputation, Jayalalithaa responded bravely by issuing a statement contradicting him.

Jayalalithaa said though born in Karnataka she was a Tamil and not a Kannadiga. An infuriated Nagaraj then warned her not to set foot again on Karnataka soil. Jayalalithaa replied that if and when necessary she would set foot on Karnataka soil.

A few weeks later Jayalalithaa was at the Premier Studio in Bangalore where the shooting of the film ‘Ganga Gowri’ was taking place. The director was the famous Kannadiga filmmaker B.R. Panthulu.. A gang of thuggish activists from Vatal Nagaraj’s outfit got to know of this and invaded the studio premises.

“I am not a Kannada woman. I am a Tamil Woman”

The mob surrounded Jayalalithaa and demanded that she withdraw her statement of being a Tamil woman and apologise to the people of Karnataka.Jayalalithaa was defiant. She refused to do so and kept repeating, “I am not a Kannada woman. I am a Tamil Woman” to the mob that had encircled her. It was with great difficulty that members of the film crew, studio workers and media personnel prevented the goondas from assaulting the unflinching actress.

Finally the Police arrived and dispersed the mob. Jayalalithaa however remained unbowed and unafraid to the very end.

This incident happened when Jayalalithaa was not engaged in politics or entertained any political ambition. Jayalalithaa reiterating her Tamilness even in the face of danger was therefore not a political stunt but a genuine reaction that reflected her inherent courage and Tamil consciousness.

In later life several of her political opponents tried to portray her as a Kannada woman in a cheap ruse to alienate her from voters in Tamil Nadu. This did not work.

Jayalalithaa studied at Church Park Convent in Chennai. She  passed her SSLC/Matriculation exams with flying colours. Her marks were the second highest in the state. Entitled to a merit scholarship, Jayalalithaa obtained admission to Stella Maris College in Madras to follow PUC classes when the academic term began. But life changed when she got offers to act in films. Although Jayalalithaa wanted to pursue her studies and become a lawyer, her mother wanted  her to take up a film career as the family was in dire financial straits. The daughter was asked to make the correct choice. After a long night of deep thought Jayalalithaa conveyed her decision in the morning. It was adieu to studies.

Uncrowned Queen of Tamil Cinema

Very few people  looking at  her rotund appearance of later years would be able to  imagine the time when Jayalalithaa was slim and lissom. That she was and a ravishing beauty too. All one has to do is to view a DVD of  one of her movies.  As an actress, Jayalalithaa was the uncrowned queen of Tamil cinema during the mid-’60s to the mid-’70s of the last century, the dream girl of many a teenager and the favourite pin-up star of many fans. As an actress Jayalalithaa sparkled on the silver screen. She acted in 142 films from 1964 to 1980 in the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi and English languages. Of these 77 films ran for over 100 days and 18 for more than 25 weeks. Her last  feature film in Tamil was ‘Nadhiyai Thedi Vandha Kadal’.

Jayalalithaa’s first Tamil film ‘Vennira Aadai’ made history even before it was released by getting an ‘A’ certificate as an adults only film. Apparently the Film Certification Board was upset by some shots of Jayalalithaa bathing and dancing in the film. The movie when released ran successfully for over a hundred days in several theatres. Jayalalithaa got rave reviews. Thousands became her fans overnight. A star was born! A fragrant sign of this stardom was in posing for advertisements extolling the virtues of Lux soap.

Jayalalithaa’s second Tamil film was ‘Aayirathil Oruvanor’  where she first played the leading lady to MG Ramachandran known as MGR. It  was a block buster. MGR was 48 years old and Jayalalithaa only 17. Despite the 31-year age difference the pair hit it off grandly on screen. More films followed and the duo made 28  films together in nine years. Almost every film was a commercial success. The jewel in the crown was ‘Adimai Penn’ or slave girl with Jayalalithaa in a dual role. The film released in 1969 was produced by MGR himself.

It was in this film that Jayalalithaa sang in her own voice for the first time on screen. It so happened that MGR once heard Jayalalithaa singing softly by herself and felt she sang well. So a solo was given to her in ‘Adimai Penn’. The song ‘Amma Endraal Anbu’ was written by lyricist Vaali and music composed by K.V. Mahadevan. She had a creamy, croony voice and the song got popular. She sang in her own voice in some other films too. Jayalalithaa’s first screen song began with the word “Amma”Years later millions of supporters started  calling her “Amma”!

The immensely-popular MGR had a network of fan clubs known as Rasikar Mandram. Though several actresses  have  paired with MGR, it was Jayalalithaa who captured the hearts of his fans. MGR’s wife Janaki was called “Anni,” meaning wife of the elder brother by fans, who also referred to Jayalalithaa as “Sinna (small) Anni”. MGR himself was infatuated with her. Though they never formally married, Jayalalithaa was regarded as the love of MGR’s life.

In spite of her unofficial liaison with MGR, the actor to whom Jayalalithaa was linked romantically was Telugu actor Sobhan Babu. He was however married and refused to divorce his wife formally and marry Jayalalithaa. Once when a Tamil magazine had a gossip article about this relationship, Jayalalithaa wrote an open letter to the publication in which she stated that both of them were in love and would marry if and when Sobhan Babu divorced his wife. That never happened and  Jayalalithaa remained  single and was  referred to as  “Selvi”  or unmarried woman.

Though she played glamorous roles, she was a good actress and made an impression if given challenging roles with scope to display histrionic ability. She exuded chic and élan in her film career and was a favourite among teens of that era. She designed many of her costumes and was a trendsetter in fashion for young women.

“Bombshell in Bikini”

Jayalalithaa was one of the first heroines to don bathing costumes on screen and was described as a bombshell in bikini.Among her successful films in Tamil were ‘Adimai Penn,’ ‘Naan,’ ‘Maatukkaara Velan,’ ‘Aathiparasakthi,’ ‘Pattikaadaa Pattanamaa,’ ‘Kavalkaran,’ ‘Engiruntho Vanthaal,’ ‘Kumari Penn,’ ‘Kandhan Karunai,’ ‘Nam Naadu,’ ‘Chandrothayam,’ ‘Kudiyiruntha Koavil,’ ‘Engal Thangam,’ ‘Enga Maamaa,’ ‘Suryakanthi,’ ‘Avan Thaan Manithan,’ etc.

Apart from MGR, Jayalalithaa acted opposite stars such as Sivaji Ganesan, Gemini Ganesan, Jaishankar, Ravichandran, Muthuraman, A.V.M. Rajan, N.T. Rama Rao, A. Nageswara Rao, Krishna, Sobhan Babu, Rajkumar and Kalyankumar.

An accomplished dancer, she lit up the screen and stage by her performances. Her dance drama, ‘Kaviri Thantha Kalaichelvi,’ was a smashing success. Jayalalithaa was versatile. She has been a magazine columnist, short story writer, novelist and film producer.

Karunanidhi  Praised her Acting

Let the last word about her splendid acting career be in the words of her arch enemy in politics Muttuvel Karunanidhi, the late  DMK leader and former Tamil Nadu chief minister.

The movie ‘Thirumangalyam’ released in January 1974 was Jayalalithaa’s 100th film. There was a felicitation ceremony where the Chief Minister at the time, Karunanidhi, was the Guest of Honour.

Recalling that his late leader C.N. Annadurai had once described actress Bhanumathy as “Nadippukku Ilakkanam Vahuthavar” (devised the grammar of acting), Karunanidhi praised Jayalalithaa in similar vein as “Nadippukku ilakkiam vahuthavar,” which meant “devised literature in acting”.

MGR Launched her  Political Career

There came  a time when MGR and Jayalalithaa got  estranged chiefly due to the Sobhan Babu affair. . While Jayalalithaa faded away from the screen, MGR formed his own political party the AIADMK  and became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. After a few years of separation there was rapprochement between both. MGR enticed her into his party and launched her on a successful political career.

MGR   brought her into politics in 1982. After entering politics Jayalalithaa became the ADMK’s propaganda and later administrative secretary. She was a Rajya Sabha MP in 1984. In 1989 she entered Tamil Nadu legislature as an elected MLA.

After MGR’s death in 1987, the ADMK founded by Ramachandran split, with his wife Janaki and paramour Jayalalithaa leading the two factions. Jayalalithaa triumphed and the party united under her leadership to sweep the polls in 1991. Thereafter she became  the imperious yet undisputed leader of the AIADMK until her illness and demise.

Few in her party dared  to call her by name and so she was “Amma,” “Madam” or “Thalaivi.” Since MGR was called “Puratchi Thalaiver,” or revolutionary leader, Jayalalithaa was addressed by its feminine equivalent, “Puratchi Thalaivi.” Like MGR, she too was called “Ithaya Deivam” (God  of the Heart).

Many in the AIADMK began  treating  her as a living deity .At least one of her former ministers  used to pat  his cheeks reverentially when referring to her. Some ministers have gone on record saying their ambition in life was to be her servant or be a watchdog in her kennel.

Years ago in a movie called Thanipiravi MGR played Lord Muruga and Jayalalithaa his consort Valli, in a dream sequence. A picture of both together as Murugan and Valli was framed and worshipped by many. Likewise, Jayalalithaa has played divine roles in many other films too. Pictures of Jayalalithaa in such roles were hung in many dwellings. Some people  even  lit camphor and laid flowers before them. Once Sycophants went to the extent of depicting her as the Madonna in posters. Enraged Catholics protested and the posters were removed.

Falling at her feet or touching them as a mark of respect was almost a ritual for many of her followers. Touching or falling at the feet of elders to seek their blessings is customary in India. But in the case of Jayalalithaa, party sycophants took  this practice to ridiculous levels.

Even party veterans older than Jayalalithaa prostrated themselves publicly. An amusing  sycophantic phenomenon were  the nauseating  references to her feet by party members when they   commenced  their speeches.

In a disgusting spectacle they began by paying homage to her “potpaadangal” (golden feet) or “thamaraithiruvadigal” (lotus feet). Like Imelda Marcos of the Philipines, Jayalalithaa herself had a fascination for footwear. There have been media reports and pictures of her 800 plus shoes, sandals and slippers.

“Vaedangalukku Nigaraana Jayalalithaavin Paadangal”

DMK Leader and former Chief Minister “Kalaigner” Karunanidhi when in the opposition took a potshot at this practice of AIADMK  Party members falling at  Jayalalithaa’s feet. The AIADMK an off-shoot of the DMK was a Dravidian party supposedly opposed to “Brahminism”. Yer these so called Dravidian party stalwarts were grovelling at this Brahmin woman’s feet. So Karunanidhi  in his inimitable alliterative style  referred to  Jayalalithaa’s feet as “Vaedangalukku Nigaraana Jayalalithaavin Paadangal” (Jayalalithaa’s feet are equal to the scriptures)

Once Jayalalithaa  was questioned by a North Indian journalist about this “falling at her feet” practice and asked  her why she did not put a stop to it. She replied that her supporters were doing so voluntarily due to their affectionate regard for her and that she was unable to prevent it.This was not correct because it is well-known that she liked it and encouraged it. Jayalalithaa also utilised this act to humiliate people.

In one instance a man who had left her party and criticised her returned to its folds again. The media was called in to witness the return of the prodigal. This man, K.K.S.R. Ramachandran, was a big-made man with a very big moustache. He was required to prostrate himself four times before a smilingly-seated Jayalalithaa under the pretext that the photographers had not got a good shot. The picture was released to all papers.

Interestingly enough this penchant for Jayalalithaa’s feet was shared even by her mentor and paramour. According to some observers, MGR had some kind of a foot fetish for Jayalalithaa. In many of the films in which they acted together, there were scenes of MGR touching Jayalalithaa’s feet such as removing a thorn from her sole or massaging a sprained ankle. Apparently the man who founded the ADMK had a fixation on her feet. Later members of MGR’s party  seem to hare  followed their leader by being at Jayalalithaa’s feet.

Dominatrix with Party People

Jayalalithaa has  often been  criticised for her arrogance. She was virtually a dominatrix with party people and treated  them like her minions and serfs. At t times, Jayalalithaa would be the only person sitting on a stage while others would remain standing or seated on the floor.

Later she dispensed with this practice but allowed  only selected persons  to sit next to her. When a senior Minister, Munu Aathi, dared to sit next to her at a function, she flared up and publicly ordered him to move back.

On another occasion a Congress cabinet minister from Tamil Nadu tried to sit next to her on a flight to New Delhi. She shouted at him to get lost and referred derisively to his caste. The man was a Dalit. There was a big outcry and a public apology was demanded. She did not budge.

During  inner meetings of the party she remained seated while the rest sat on the floor or remained standing. There have been press conferences where her ministers stood behind her with folded hands while she sat on a sofa.Later she stopped doing this.

However there was  no inner party democracy in the AIADMK. Jayalalithaa appointed, removed, transferred, promoted, demoted, expelled and recruited  at her own discretion. Ministers were appointed, fired or shuffled according to her whims. Her wish was the party’s command. None dared to disobey let alone defy. She was an autocrat who did not tolerate criticism. She looked  down upon the media and brooked  no dissent.

While her haughty demeanour and arrogant attitude deserved to be condemned, there was perhaps a rationale for such behaviour. The ascendancy of Jayalalithaa in a Tamil Nadu milieu could  be viewed as an ironic contradiction to the norms prevailing in the state.

Despite the breeze of cosmopolitanism blowing in through globalisation, the state of Tamil Nadu is basically conservative. It is a patriarchal, male-dominated society with strict notions of a woman’s role and place – Jayalalithaa was a woman.

Tamil Nadu society at large has contempt for women actors in the cine field who do not behave as ‘good’ women should. Woman film stars, in spite of their glamour, are not respected and regarded with disdain in private – Jayalalithaa was an actress.

The dominant political ideology in the state is that of Dravidianism. This is based on archaic concepts of the Aryan-Dravidian divide where the Brahmin community is seen as Aryans and other Tamils as Dravidians. Anti-Brahminism is a core element of Dravidian discourse – Jayalalithaa was a Brahmin.

Woman, Film star and Brahmin.

Thus, one can see that the Jayalalithaa phenomenon went  against the grain of three dominant concepts in Tamil Nadu. She was a woman, a film star and a Brahmin. The success of this embodiment in the socio-political realm of Tamil Nadu was a contradiction. Jayalalithaa, in a way, was an exception or aberration.

In that context, the situation could have  been quite dicey for her. If she were to be democratic and easygoing, the people surrounding her may have  exploited  it to their advantage. Instead of appreciating her conduct, they would very likely have regarded  it as a weakness and taken  advantage.

Treated with Reverence.

When she entered politics, many party members were dazzled by her beauty and easy accessibility. They were extra-attentive to her and ever ready to make physical contact. A regional leader from Madurai called “Pazhakkadai” Pandi went ballistic once on stage. He was reprimanded by MGR. Thereafter the order went out from MGR that Jayalalithaa should be treated with reverence. This changed the situation. Soon party people  began showing great subservience to her. Slowly she was promoted as a superior, cult figure.

After MGR’s death Jayalalithaa was quite vulnerable.An Indian editor once told me of an incident that happened in 1988. The ADMK had split after MGR’s death and both factions were trying to take control of the party headquarters building. When Jayalalithaa joined demonstrators party supporters mobbed her.

Sadly , she had to be rescued by the Police from her own supporters. Jayalalithaa used to wear pure white sarees with a thin border then. The Indian editor told me that her Saree and blouse were full of grubby finger marks. Apparently her supporters had used the opportunity to try and fondle her or squeeze her. In later life she had her own set of bodyguards known as the “poonaipadai”(Cat force)to prevent supporters from getting close to her.

Unquestionable Superiority

Jayalalithaa perhaps realised that  she had to assert unquestionable superiority over her party people to remain in control. Superiority and not equality was necessary. The followers had to be put in place as inferiors. This she began to do vigorously.

Soon she became an authoritative figure. She grew into her role and her inherent traits of arrogance  and domination came to the fore. She humiliated her followers to show who was boss and trampled them underfoot. Incredible as it may seem, they seem to like it, with even highly educated professionals paying pooja horizontally to the brahmin boss lady.

Vicious, Vndictive Streak

This state of affairs may help to understand the reasons for her arrogant conduct but it certainly cannot condone it. Moreover, there was a vicious, vindictive streak to her that often manifests itself in controversial ways.

There was a woman administrative officer (IAS), Chandralekha, with whom she had a disagreement. Soon acid was thrown by goondas on Chandralekha’s face. As Chief Minister she abused her authority and incarcerated her rival, Karunanidhi. The Police carried the howling man away.

Due to a dispute with the Kachipuram “Sangara madam” Holy seer Sri Jayendra Swamigal, Jayalalithaa went to the extent of getting him arrested on what seemed to be false charges.

When maverick politico Dr. Subramaniam Swamy fell foul of her, Jayalalithaa organised a hostile reception for him in Chennai. Members of the ADMK Women’s League raised their sarees in a protest demonstration. “Subramanian Swamy has met his waterloo,” gloated Jayalalithaa publicly. “I will send Jayalalithaa to the loo without water,” retorted Swamy.

Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was taken ill on 22 September 2016 and admitted to Apollo Hospital in Chennai. On 4 December 2016 she suffered a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Apollo. Her condition was critical and she was put on life support. She passed away on 5 December 2016.
