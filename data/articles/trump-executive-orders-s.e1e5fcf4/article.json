    "What\u2019s happened?The US president, Donald Trump, has issued executive orders (EOs) at a pace significantly in excess of recent presidencies. EIU\u2019s analysis shows that around three-quarters of the EOs issued have some link to Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for government published in 2023 by a US-based think-tank, The Heritage Foundation, which Mr\u00a0Trump had distanced himself from during the 2024 presidential election\u00a0campaign.Why does it matter?The rapid pace of EO issuance highlights the administration\u2019s desire to expand executive powers.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump had signed 99\u00a0EOs as at March\u00a024th, compared with 35 at the same stage of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and 17 during Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s first term. The volume of issuance is only comparable to that of early 20th century presidencies and those during wartime. As\u00a0we have noted previously, Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s administration is likely to be characterised by efforts to expand presidential powers in ways that push back against established checks and balances, with EOs forming a central part of these\u00a0efforts.The EOs highlight the priorities for Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0\u201cSecurity\u201d is the top policy concern, according to our analysis, with 16\u00a0EOs centred on the topic, revealing a focus on national defence and border security issues. It is followed by \u201ctrade and tariffs\u201d, \u201cdomestic economic policy\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d issues in terms of concern. Culture war issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and free speech/censorship run through the EOs and feature prominently in key word analysis. Domestic economy-related EOs reveal an overturning in Biden-era initiatives in relation to state subsidisation of green infrastructure and technology manufacturing, and a focus instead on deregulation initiatives, especially in the areas of AI and\u00a0energy.Project 2025 has clearly been an influential guide for Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s early days in office. We have identified textual connections between about 70% of Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s EOs and Project\u00a02025. These include, for example, EO\u00a014151 on abolishing DEI programmes in government, which is consistent with recommendations for reforming the civil service in Project 2025; EO\u00a014153 on reversing restrictions on resources development in Alaska, which was a Project\u00a02025 recommendation for energy policy; and EO\u00a014242 on closing the Department of Education, which was also cited in Project\u00a02025. A number of the contributors to Project\u00a02025 hold positions within Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s executive team, including Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and\u00a0Budget.Strong linkages with Project 2025 offer clues as to the future direction of policy.\u00a0An essay in the document on \u201cfair trade\u201d by Peter Navarro (who is now a key trade adviser) that was centred on the idea of\u00a0reciprocal tariff actions\u00a0has proved to be influential. It suggests that US policy goals could extend to reforming or even abolishing most-favoured nation (MFN) trade principles that underpin the global trade system. Project\u00a02025 also indicates that efforts to tackle the so-called administrative state have further to run. In addition to the dismantling of the department of education and several other agencies, Project\u00a02025 suggests that deep cuts could also be coming to the department of homeland security, among other organisations. The Trump administration has so far been reluctant to interfere with the Federal Reserve (Fed, the central bank), but Project 2025\u2019s call for it to adopt a single mandate of price stability rather than a dual mandate that also includes maximum employment suggests that pressure on the Fed could ramp\u00a0up.The EOs also indicate limits to Project 2025\u2019s influence as Mr\u00a0Trump pursues his own priorities.\u00a0The cost-cutting Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), created through EO\u00a014158, did not feature in the blueprint. Neither did establishing a sovereign wealth fund (EO\u00a014196) or terminating the foreign corrupt practices act (EO\u00a014209). In addition, although it is supportive of the full use of presidential authority, Project\u00a02025 is also clear in its support for the principle of separation of powers and, separately, advocates for tighter regulation of big tech firms. These more conventional conservative positions might clash with those of other groups within the political coalition assembled by Mr\u00a0Trump, such as those represented by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs like Elon Musk (the de facto head of DOGE). The relative influence of these groups over Mr\u00a0Trump will be an important factor in predicting the direction of policy, alongside the individual views of the president himself and the course of future\u00a0events.What next?We will keep tracking EOs as guides to US policy direction as well as what they suggest about the political influence of the different groups and individuals around Mr\u00a0Trump. Mr\u00a0Trump issued 220\u00a0EOs over his first four-year term; the current pace suggests that he could exceed that by several\u00a0times.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
