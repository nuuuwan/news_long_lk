    "Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale. This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI\u2019s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google\u2019s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.\u00a0   @absolutemem  If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I\u2019d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.\u00a0 My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That\u2019s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now\u2014the internet \u201censhittified,\u201d with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn\u2019t fully understand what I was rejecting\u2014what I found so objectionable.",
    "To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there\u2019s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity\u2014one we\u2019re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.\u00a0 \u00a0The slop boom \u201cAI slop\u201d can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what\u2019s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It\u2019s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.",
    "Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway\u2019s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue. Related StoryHow do AI models generate videos?Read next These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema\u2014tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a \u201cworld simulator\u201d while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.\u00a0 All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they\u2019re being used is more modest, weirder\u2014and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.\u00a0 Anyone can and does use these tools; a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users\u2014people who aren\u2019t \u201ccreators\u201d so much as just people with phones.\u00a0  That\u2019s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera\u2014videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn\u2019t start with AI\u2014TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats\u2014it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don\u2019t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.\u00a0 Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta\u2019s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips. Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there\u2019s \u201cnazislop,\u201d the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens\u2019 For You pages. But the prevalence of bad actors hasn\u2019t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that \u201cpasses as real\u201d toward embracing AI\u2019s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what \u201cAI slop\u201d is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.",
    "Meet the creators Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, \u201cThere is definitely a competition of \u2018How weird we can push this?\u2019 among AI video creators.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art\u2014especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.\u00a0 Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. \u201cI fell right into it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.\u201d Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned \u201cCooking up some fresh AI slop,\u201d shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.   @digitalpersons  AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. \u201cI would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,\u201d he says. Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There\u2019s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo\u2019s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.\u00a0 His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.\u00a0  One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the \u201cauntie culture\u201d in Singapore, where she\u2019s from.",
    "\u201cThe word \u2018aunties\u2019 often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to create a world where it\u2019s different for them.\u201d\u00a0 Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.",
    "There\u2019s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny\u2019s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.  @grannyspills  These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.\u00a0  In the same vein, it\u2019s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider\u00a0 \u201cItalian brainrot,\u201d which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human\u2013animal\u2013object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like \u201cBombardiro Crocodilo\u201d and \u201cTralalero Tralala.\u201d According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.\u00a0  @patapimai  \u201cItalian brainrot was great when it first hit,\u201d says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. \u201cIt was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator\u2014they were made by the chronically online users.\u201d\u00a0 This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools\u2014like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative. Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as \u201ccat dancing in a park.\u201d The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.",
    "OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.\u00a0 In defense of slop The current use of the word \u201cslop\u201d online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it\u2019s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports. But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: \u201cslop\u201d has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary\u2019s new sense of \u201cslop\u201d will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as \u201ccontent on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.",
    "Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. \u201cI see this series as an experimental sketchbook,\u201d he says. \u201cI am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.\u201d Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is \u201cart.\u201d Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. \u201cThe AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there\u2019s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.\u201d\u00a0 Related StoryThe 8 worst technology failures of 2024Read next That\u2019s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.\u00a0 Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond \u2018Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,\u2019\u201d he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: \u201cThere's a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There's a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there's a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.\u201d And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We\u2019ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it\u2019s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn\u2019t exactly choose. But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as \u201cgrifting\u201d and \u201cgarbage.\u201d The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.\u00a0 \u201cThe phrase \u2018AI slop\u2019 implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people\u2014understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn't incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,\u201d says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.\u00a0 At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there\u2019s a kind of shame involved\u2014one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.\u00a0  Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as \u201cserious\u201d or \u201crelevant\u201d art.\u00a0 Related StoryThe AI Hype Index: The people can\u2019t get enough of AI slopRead next For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: \u201cEvery big advance in technology yields the question \u2018What is the role of the artist?\u2019\u201d she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.\u00a0 Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. \u201cIt is a skill to be learned and mastered,\u201d she says. There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before. It\u2019s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to copy the style,\u201d Lim says. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m doing it \u2026 Even when people try to imitate that, they don\u2019t have that consistency.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,\u201d says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they\u2019ve traditionally enjoyed. A new online culture For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It\u2019s only possible because it\u2019s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average\u2014arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the \u201cformulaic derivativeness\u201d that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.\u00a0 But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it\u2019s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn\u2019t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can\u2019t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn\u2019t mean giving up. It\u2019s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn\u2019t about control anyway. It\u2019s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone. Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What\u2019s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It\u2019s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal\u2014so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre\u2014that it loops back around and becomes compelling.\u00a0 To \u201clove AI slop\u201d is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.\u00a0 Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, \u201cDo you know you are AI generated?\u201d\u2014parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors\u2019 responses seem so AI, but of course they\u2019re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.\u00a0 Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it\u2019s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.\u00a0 hide"
