United National Party (UNP) general-secretary Palitha Range Bandara has suggested that the presidential and parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka should be postponed, and each term should be extended by two more years. Bandara states that this would give the incumbent president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, more time to stabilise the economy, as election campaigns could potentially disrupt progress. This proposal would require passage by Parliament and ratification by the public in a referendum. However, critics argue that the proposition is a ruse to keep Wickremesinghe in power. Despite its mixed reception, the proposal only represents Bandaraâ€™s personal viewpoint, though many have treated it as an official government announcement.
