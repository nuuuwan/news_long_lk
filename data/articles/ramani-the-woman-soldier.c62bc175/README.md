Ramani Lalithangani Bandara

Ramani Lalithangani Bandara, one of the pioneering young women to join the Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps in November 1979 passed away last week. She was 66.

An old girl of Kegalle Balika Vidyalaya, her prowess as an athlete, especially netball, led to her selection to the second intake of the first batch of six young women officers to be trained in the United Kingdom.

Upon her return, Ramani held several senior roles in the fledgling organisation including that of the Adjutant, Training Officer of new women recruits and logistics officer. Promoted Major, she served as a Staff Officer of Legal Affairs and held the post of the 2nd in Command of the 1st Women’s Corps Regiment prior to leaving the army.

Her brother Senani Bandara who also joined the army was captured and killed during the Eelam conflict.

Upon leaving the service, she opted to pick up the pen and joined the Lake House Group of Newspapers as a journalist. She worked in the Observer, Sunday Observer and Daily News editorials contributing to general news and business news. Long after leaving Lake House she maintained close contact with former colleagues.

A kind and caring young woman, she did not forget her military connections and the young women of the regiment she helped to deliver and nurture. She organised ways to remember and continually assist the families of 27 women soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country.

Ramani also initiated in 2014, the ‘Viruliyasevana Foundation,’ an organisation to recognise the services and render assistance to the women of the tri-services and scholarships for their children.

She also started the exService Women’s Association 30 years ago and was its first President.

To commemorate its 10th anniversary she organised the making of a short film ‘Apasu Haren’ (About-turn) which highlighted pitfalls on youth progress and advocating preventive measures

She leaves behind her son Hiran and daughter Rajitha.

She will be fondly remembered.

Remains will be laid for honour and respect of family, friends and associates from 3:30 p.m. on Saturday 2 August till Sunday 3 August 2 p.m. at “The Respect Home” 483, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 8. Pansakula will be at 1 p.m.

Remains will be handed over to the Sri Lanka Army for a military funeral by 2:30 p.m. and cremation is at 3:30 p.m.

May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.
