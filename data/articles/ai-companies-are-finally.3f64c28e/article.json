The more training data, the more powerful the model.\u00a0  But there\u2019s a problem. AI companies have pillaged the internet for training data, and many websites and data set owners have started restricting the ability to scrape their websites. We\u2019ve also seen a backlash against the AI sector\u2019s practice of indiscriminately scraping online data, in the form of\u00a0users opting out of making their data available for training\u00a0and lawsuits from artists, writers, and the\u00a0New York Times, claiming that AI companies have taken their intellectual property without consent or compensation.\u00a0 Last week three major record labels\u2014Sony Music, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group\u2014announced they were suing the AI music companies Suno and Udio over alleged copyright infringement. The music labels claim the companies made use of copyrighted music in their training data \u201cat an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d allowing the AI models to generate songs that \u201cimitate the qualities of genuine human sound recordings.\u201d\u00a0My colleague James O\u2019Donnell dissects the lawsuits in his story and points out that these lawsuits could determine the future of AI music.\u00a0Read it here.",
    "But this moment also sets an interesting precedent for all of generative AI development. Thanks to the scarcity of high-quality data and the immense pressure and demand to build even bigger and better models, we\u2019re in a rare moment where data owners actually have some leverage. The music industry\u2019s lawsuit sends the loudest message yet: High-quality training data is not free.\u00a0 It will likely take a few years at least before we have legal clarity around copyright law, fair use, and AI training data. But the cases are already ushering in changes. OpenAI has been striking deals with news publishers such as\u00a0Politico, the\u00a0Atlantic,\u00a0Time, the\u00a0Financial Times, and others, and exchanging publishers\u2019 news archives for money and citations. And YouTube announced in late June that it will offer licensing deals to top record labels in exchange for music for training.",
    "These changes are a mixed bag. On one hand, I\u2019m concerned that news publishers are making a Faustian bargain with AI. For example, most of the media houses that have made deals with OpenAI say the deal stipulates that OpenAI cite its sources. But language models are fundamentally incapable of being factual and are best at making things up. Reports have shown that ChatGPT and the AI-powered search engine Perplexity frequently hallucinate citations, which makes it hard for OpenAI to honor its promises.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s tricky for AI companies too. This shift could lead to them build smaller, more efficient models, which are\u00a0far less polluting. Or they may fork out a fortune to access data at the scale they need to build the next big one. Only the companies most flush with cash, and/or with large existing data sets of their own (such as Meta, with its two decades of social media data), can afford to do that. So the latest developments risk concentrating power even further into the hands of the biggest players.\u00a0 On the other hand, the idea of introducing consent into this process is a good one\u2014not just for rights holders, who can benefit from the AI boom, but for all of us. We should all have the agency to decide how our data is used, and a fairer data economy would mean we could all benefit.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Algorithm Deeper Learning How AI video games can help reveal the mysteries of the human mind Neuroscientists and psychologists have long been using games as research tools to learn about the human mind. Video games have been either co-opted or specially designed to study how people learn, navigate, and cooperate with others, for example. AI video games\u2014where characters don\u2019t need scripts and appear to play when you're not watching\u2014could allow us to probe more deeply and unravel enduring mysteries about our brains and behavior, suggests my colleague Jessica Hamzelou in our weekly biotech newsletter, The Checkup. Ready, set, go:\u00a0Scientists who have done this type of study were able to observe and study how players behaved in these games: how they explored their virtual environment, how they sought rewards, how they made decisions. And research volunteers didn\u2019t need to travel to a lab\u2014their gaming behavior could be observed from wherever they happened to be playing, whether that was at home, at a library, or even inside an MRI scanner.\u00a0Read more from Jessica.

A startling statistic: Data centers use more electricity than most countries. (Bloomberg)\u00a0 The AI boom has an unlikely early winner: wonky consultantsIt seems every company out there is thinking about how to use AI. But the problem is that nobody is sure exactly how to do that. And so in come consultants, who are profiting from AI FOMO. Work related to generative AI will make up about 40% of McKinsey\u2019s business this year.
