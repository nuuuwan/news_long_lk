The article describes Palestinian protests in Ramallah marking the 76th anniversary of the Nakba, the 1948 event that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The piece criticizes the United States, United Kingdom, and their allies, including Israel, holding them accountable for the Nakba and the ongoing suffering of Palestinians, including massacres and displacements. It argues that the United Nations, influenced by the U.S., has failed to deliver justice. The article also accuses Zionists and their Western supporters of erasing Palestinian history and identity, perpetuating Nakba through dehumanization and conflict. It mentions the film "Farha" as a vivid depiction of these atrocities and highlights how Western manipulation aids in perpetuating these narratives. Prominent figures and historical references, including Edward Said and Yasser Arafat, are cited to support the claims of injustice and failure in delivering peace and justice to Palestinians.
