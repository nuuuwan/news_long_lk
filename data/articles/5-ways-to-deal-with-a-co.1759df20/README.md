It’s easy to get angry when you’re constantly picking up the slack or fixing mistakes caused by a rule-breaker. You might feel like you’re always cleaning up their messes, correcting their work, or filling in gaps they’ve left. The unfairness of it all can also get under your skin and cause resentment. But you can’t just march up to them and demand they stop ignoring standards. Ordering them to fall in line rarely works. Here are five strategies for how to address the issue without creating hostility or damaging your working relationship.

But the way he just ignores our processes…it’s frustrating.” While Rich’s talent was clear, his dismissive attitude toward company protocols was causing a lot of headaches. Jackson was having trouble keeping his cool every time Rich bypassed the design review process or seemed to totally disregard their brand guidelines.
