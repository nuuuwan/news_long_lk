    "When implementing responsible computing initiatives, companies run into a common problem: They rush to deploy their respective programs before they\u2019ve finished designing them. The results are predictable: inefficient and difficult-to-scale efforts at managing AI\u2019s ethical, reputational, and legal risks; wasted resources; and slowed innovation. To assess how ready their company is to implement an RAI program, leaders should ask eight questions: 1) Have you determined what its objectives are? 2) Are your RAI\u2019s values clearly connected to procedures? 3) Have you designed RAI metrics, such as KPIs and OKRs? 4) Have you trained the people responsible for overseeing its implementation? 5) Do you have personnel to ensure the program is rolled out, scaled, and maintained properly? 6) How will the program harmonize with other enterprise priorities? 7) Do you have a strategic roadmap for the RAI? 8) Have you designed an implementation playbook?",
    "As companies devote resources to implementing AI, many realize that they need a strategy to manage the technology\u2019s well-documented ethical, regulatory, and legal risks. A responsible AI program (or \u201cRAI\u201d program for short) not only builds guardrails for particular AI solutions and the teams that manage them, but it also defines the enterprise-wide policy, governance structures, roles and responsibilities, processes, and more that enable wide-scale deployment of AI.",
