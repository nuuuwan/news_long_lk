    "In a pine forest on Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging. But earlier this year, the mine\u2019s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine\u2019s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.\u00a0  Kent Sorenson, Allonnia\u2019s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. \u201cThe low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia\u2019s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.",
    "The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal. Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn\u2019t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. \u201cThe technology we\u2019re using now didn\u2019t exist a few years ago,\u201d she says.",
    "Related StoryHow plants could mine metals from the soilRead next Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.\u00a0  Endolith scientists use columns filled with copper ore to test the firm\u2019s method of actively managing microbes in the ore to increase metal extraction.ENDOLITH   In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith\u2019s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines. Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. \u201cWhat guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?\u201d Brierley asks. Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won\u2019t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.\u00a0 \u201cThey are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be your biggest supporters, but they\u2019re going to be your biggest critics.\u201d In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. \u201cThis is not software,\u201d Rasner says.\u00a0\u00a0 Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.\u00a0  Nuton is testing an improved bioleaching process at Gunnison Copper\u2019s Johnson Camp mine in Arizona.NUTON   While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.",
    "\u201cYou can do what mining companies have traditionally done,\u201d says CEO Jai Padmakumar. \u201cOr you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.\u201d Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining. Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. \u201cThe microbes are the manufacturing,\u201d says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow\u2019s lab. To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. \u201cBiomining is one of these areas where the need \u2026 is big enough,\u201d he says.\u00a0 The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand. hide"
