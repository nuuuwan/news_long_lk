# How ‚ÄúCarewashing‚Äù Alienates Employees

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- Many organizations falsely believe they have a positive work culture by offering wellness initiatives while promoting unsustainable work practices, a concept referred to as "carewashing."
- Carewashing is a term derived from greenwashing and whitewashing, meaning to cover up or mislead regarding a failure to meet certain commitments or standards.
- Employee well-being has been associated with improved organizational performance.
- In the post-pandemic era, many employees are experiencing high levels of stress and burnout and are seeking workplaces that truly value well-being.
- According to a 2024 Gallup survey, only 21% of employees believe their organization cares about their well-being, down from 49% in 2020.
- Improving work culture and well-being is more important than increased compensation for many employees considering leaving their jobs, known as "quiet quitters".

Opinions:
- The author suggests that organizations who merely provide mindfulness or yoga classes but maintain a "work hard, play hard" culture are not genuinely focused on promoting a positive and safe work environment.
- Despite the historical unhappiness of workers, the author believes that leaders should do everything in their power to provide healthy, motivating workplaces.
- The decline in employees believing their organization cares about their well-being represents a negative trend leaders need to address. 
- The author advocates for businesses to take genuine steps in improving company culture and employee well-being, rather than merely "carewashing".

Too many organizations with unsustainable ‚Äúwork hard, play hard‚Äù cultures believe that checking the well-being box by offering mindfulness training or yoga classes qualifies them as having a positive and safe culture when, in fact, they‚Äôre merely ‚Äúcarewashing.‚Äù Like the more familiar term greenwashing, carewashing is derived from whitewashing: covering up or putting a misleading spin on a failure to meet some commitment, stated claim, or standard. At a time when employee well-being has been unequivocally tied to organizational performance and yet workers are historically unhappy, leaders should do everything in their power to provide healthy, motivating workplaces. The authors present four strategies to safeguard against carewashing.

Post-pandemic, employees have experienced record-high stress and burnout and are increasingly attracted to organizations with cultures that support well-being at work. A 2024 Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of employees who strongly agree that their organization cares about their overall well-being has plunged from 49% in 2020 to 21% in 2024, while a previous survey found that improving well-being and culture rated much higher than increasing compensation among the things ¬†‚Äúquiet quitters‚Äù would like to change about their work.
