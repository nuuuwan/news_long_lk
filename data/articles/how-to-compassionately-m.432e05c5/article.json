    "Managing an employee with a terminal illness requires a balance of compassion and strategic action. When an employee receives a terminal diagnosis continuing to work might offer them a sense of normalcy and purpose. As the illness becomes a part of their daily life, work can be a respite by helping them maintain social connections and feel productive. Managers in this situation should follow three interlinked strategies: First, support your terminally ill employee by adapting the work environment to their needs, such as flexible hours or remote work, and involve them in decisions about their role adjustments. This shows respect and ensures they feel valued. Second, maintain team morale by balancing honesty with sensitivity and facilitating opportunities for the team to express their feelings. Finally, ensure business continuity by helping the employee document key responsibilities, create a transition plan, and involve the team in the transition process.",
