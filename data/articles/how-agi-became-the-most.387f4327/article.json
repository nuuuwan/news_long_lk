    "Are you feeling it?  I hear it\u2019s close: two years, five years\u2014maybe next year! And I hear it\u2019s going to change everything: it will cure disease, save the planet, and usher in an age of abundance. It will solve our biggest problems in ways we cannot yet imagine. It will redefine what it means to be human.\u00a0 Wait\u2014what if that\u2019s all too good to be true? Because I also hear it will bring on the apocalypse and kill us all \u2026\u00a0 Either way, and whatever your timeline, something big is about to happen.\u00a0  We could be talking about the Second Coming. Or the day when Heaven\u2019s Gaters imagined they\u2019d be picked up by a UFO and transformed into enlightened aliens. Or the moment when Donald Trump finally decides to deliver the storm that Q promised. But no. We\u2019re of course talking about artificial general intelligence, or AGI\u2014that hypothetical near-future technology that (I hear) will be able to do pretty much whatever a human brain can do.    This story is part of MIT Technology Review\u2019s series \u201cThe New Conspiracy Age,\u201d on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.   For many, AGI is more than just a technology. In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, it\u2019s talked about in mystical terms. Ilya Sutskever, cofounder and former chief scientist at OpenAI, is said to have led chants of \u201cFeel the AGI!\u201d at team meetings. And he feels it more than most: In 2024, he left OpenAI, whose stated mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, to cofound Safe Superintelligence, a startup dedicated to figuring out how to avoid a so-called rogue AGI (or control it when it comes). Superintelligence is the hot new flavor\u2014AGI but better!\u2014introduced as talk of AGI becomes commonplace. Sutskever also exemplifies the mixed-up motivations at play among many self-anointed AGI evangelists. He has spent his career building the foundations for a future technology that he now finds terrifying. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be monumental, earth-shattering\u2014there will be a before and an after,\u201d he told me a few months before he quit OpenAI. When I asked him why he had redirected his efforts into reining that technology in, he said: \u201cI\u2019m doing it for my own self-interest. It\u2019s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.\u201d",
    "He\u2019s far from alone in his grandiose, even apocalyptic, thinking.\u00a0 Every age has its believers, people with an unshakeable faith that something huge is about to happen\u2014a before and an after that they are privileged (or doomed) to live through.\u00a0\u00a0  For us, that\u2019s the promised advent of AGI. People are used to hearing that this or that is the next big thing, says Shannon Vallor, who studies the ethics of technology at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cIt used to be the computer age and then it was the internet age and now it\u2019s the AI age,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to have something presented to you and be told that this thing is the future. What\u2019s different, of course, is that in contrast to computers and the internet, AGI doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d And that\u2019s why feeling the AGI is not the same as boosting the next big thing. There\u2019s something weirder going on. Here\u2019s what I think: AGI is a lot like a conspiracy theory, and it may be the most consequential one of our time.",
    "I have been reporting on artificial intelligence for more than a decade, and I\u2019ve watched the idea of AGI bubble up from the backwaters to become the dominant narrative shaping an entire industry. A onetime pipe dream now props up the profit lines of some of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and thus, you could argue, the US stock market. It justifies dizzying down payments on the new power plants and data centers that we\u2019re told are needed to make the dream come true. Fixated on this hypothetical technology, AI firms are selling us hard.\u00a0 Just listen to what the heads of some of those companies are telling us. AGI will be as smart as an entire \u201ccountry of geniuses\u201d (Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic); it will kick-start \u201can era of maximum human flourishing, where we travel to the stars and colonize the galaxy\u201d (Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind); it will \u201cmassively increase abundance and prosperity,\u201d even encourage people to enjoy life more and have more children (Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI). That\u2019s some product. Or not. Don\u2019t forget the flip side, of course. When those people are not shilling for utopia, they\u2019re saving us from hell. In 2023, Amodei, Hassabis, and Altman all put their names to a 22-word statement that read: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d Elon Musk says AI has a 20% chance of annihilating humans.\u00a0 Related StoryWhat is AI?Read next \u201cI\u2019ve noticed recently that superintelligence, which I thought was a concept you definitely shouldn\u2019t mention if you want to be taken seriously in public, is being thrown around by tech CEOs who are apparently planning to build it,\u201d says Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts, an organization that surveys AI researchers about their field. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to feel like this is fine. They also say it\u2019s going to kill us, but they\u2019re laughing while they say it.\u201d  You have to admit it all sounds a bit tinfoil hat. If you're building a conspiracy theory, you need a few things in the mix: a scheme that\u2019s flexible enough to sustain belief even when things don\u2019t work out as planned; the promise of a better future that can be realized only if believers uncover hidden truths; and a hope for salvation from the horrors of this world.\u00a0 AGI just about checks all those boxes. The more you poke at the idea, the more it starts to look like a conspiracy. It\u2019s not, of course\u2014not exactly. And I\u2019m not drawing this parallel to dismiss the very real, often jaw-dropping results achieved by many people in this field, including (or especially) the AGI believers.\u00a0 But by zooming in on things that AGI has in common with genuine conspiracies, I think we can bring the whole concept into better focus and reveal it for what it is: a techno-utopian (or techno-dystopian\u2014pick your pill) fever dream that got its hooks into some pretty deep-seated beliefs that have made it hard to shake. This isn't just a provocative thought experiment. It\u2019s important to question what we\u2019re told about AGI because buying into the idea isn\u2019t harmless. Right now, AGI is the most important narrative in tech\u2014and, to some extent, in the global economy. We can\u2019t make sense of what\u2019s going on in AI without understanding where the idea of AGI came from, why it is so compelling, and how it shapes the way we think about technology overall.",
    "I get it, I get it\u2014calling AGI a conspiracy isn\u2019t a perfect analogy. It will also piss a lot of people off. But come with me down this rabbit hole and let me show you the light.\u00a0 How Silicon Valley got AGI-pilled It had a ring to it A typical conspiracy theory usually starts out on the fringes. Maybe it\u2019s just a couple of people posting on a message board, gathering \u201cevidence.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a few people out in the desert with binoculars waiting to spot some bright lights in the sky. But some conspiracy theories get lucky, if you will: They start to percolate more widely; they start to become a bit more acceptable; they start to influence people in power. Maybe it\u2019s the UFOs (ahem, sorry, \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d) that are now formally and openly discussed in government hearings. Maybe it\u2019s vaccine skepticism (yes, a much more dangerous example) that becomes official policy. And it\u2019s impossible to ignore that artificial general intelligence has followed a pretty similar trajectory to its more overtly conspiratorial brethren.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go back to 2007, when AI wasn\u2019t sexy and it wasn\u2019t cool. Companies like Amazon and Netflix (which was still sending out DVDs in the mail) were using machine-learning models, proto-organisms to today\u2019s LLM behemoths, to recommend movies and books to customers. But that was more or less it. Ben Goertzel had far bigger plans. About a decade earlier, the AI researcher had set up a dot-com startup called Webmind to train what he thought of as a kind of digital baby brain on the early internet. Childless, Webmind soon went bust.  But Goertzel was an influential figure in a fringe community of researchers who had dreamed for years of building humanlike artificial intelligence, an all-purpose computer program that could do many of the things people can do (and do them better). It was a vision that went far beyond the kind of tech that Netflix was experimenting with. Goertzel wanted to put out a book promoting that vision, and he needed a name that would set it apart from the humdrum AI of the time. A former Webmind employee named Shane Legg suggested Artificial General Intelligence. It had a ring to it. A few years later, Legg cofounded DeepMind with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. But to most serious researchers at the time, the claim that AI would one day mimic human abilities was a bit of a joke. AGI used to be a dirty word, Sutskever told me. Andrew Ng, founder of Google Brain and former chief scientist at the Chinese tech giant Baidu, told me he thought it was loony. So what happened? I caught up with Goertzel last month to ask how a fringe idea went from crackpot to commonplace. \u201cI\u2019m sort of a complex chaotic systems guy, so I have a low estimate that I actually know what the nonlinear dynamic in the memosphere really was,\u201d he said. (Translation: It\u2019s complicated.)",
    "Goertzel reckons a few things took the idea mainstream. The first is the Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, an annual meeting of researchers that he helped set up in 2008, the year after his book was published. The conference was often coordinated with top mainstream academic meetups, such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference and the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. \u201cIf I just published a book with that name AGI, it possibly would have just come and gone,\u201d says Goertzel. \u201cBut the conference was circling through every year, with more and more students coming.\u201d Next is Legg, who took the term with him to DeepMind. \u201cI think they were the first mainstream corporate entity to talk about AGI,\u201d says Goertzel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the main thing they were harping on, but Shane and Demis would talk about it now and then. That was certainly a source of legitimation.\u201d",
    "When I first talked to Legg about AGI five years ago, he said: \u201cTalking about AGI in the early 2000s put you on the lunatic fringe \u2026 Even when we started DeepMind in 2010, we got an astonishing amount of eye-rolling at conferences.\u201d But by 2020 the wind had changed. \u201cSome people are uncomfortable with it, but it\u2019s coming in from the cold,\u201d he told me. The third thing Goertzel points to is the overlap between early AGI evangelists and Big Tech power brokers. In the years between shutting down Webmind and publishing that AGI book, Goertzel did some work with Peter Thiel at Thiel\u2019s hedge fund Clarium Capital. \u201cWe talked a bunch,\u201d says Goertzel. He recalls spending a day with Thiel at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. \u201cI was trying to drum AGI into his head,\u201d says Goertzel. \u201cBut then he was also hearing from Eliezer how AGI is going to kill everybody.\u201d  Enter the doomers That\u2019s Eliezer Yudkowsky, another influential figure who has done at least as much as Goertzel, if not more, to push the idea of AGI. But unlike Goertzel, Yudkowsky thinks there\u2019s a very high chance\u201499.5% is one number he throws out\u2014that the development of AGI will be a catastrophe.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2000, Yudkowsky cofounded a nonprofit research outfit called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (later renamed the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), which pretty quickly dedicated itself to preventing doomer scenarios. Thiel was an early benefactor.\u00a0 At first, Yudkowsky\u2019s ideas didn\u2019t get much pickup. Recall that back then the idea of an all-powerful AI\u2014let alone a dangerous one\u2014was pure sci-fi. But in 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, published a book called Superintelligence. \u201cIt put the AGI thing out there,\u201d says Goertzel. \u201cI mean, Bill Gates, Elon Musk\u2014lots of tech-industry AI people\u2014read that book, and whether or not they agreed with his doomer perspective, Nick took Eliezer\u2019s concepts and wrapped them up in a very acceptable way.\u201d",
    "\u201cAll of these things gave AGI a stamp of acceptability,\u201d Goertzel adds. \u201cRather than it being pure crackpot stuff from mavericks howling out in the wilderness.\u201d  STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN   Yudkowsky has been banging the same drum for 25 years; many engineers at today\u2019s top AI companies grew up reading and discussing his views online, especially on LessWrong, a popular hub for the tech industry\u2019s fervent community of rationalists and effective altruists. Today, those views are more popular than ever, capturing the imagination of a younger generation of doomers like David Krueger, a researcher at the University of Montreal who previously served as research director at the UK\u2019s AI Security Institute. \u201cI think we are definitely on track to build superhuman AI systems that will kill everybody,\u201d Krueger tells me. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s horrible and we should stop immediately.\u201d Yudkowsky gets profiled by the likes of the New York Times, which bills him as \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s version of a doomsday preacher.\u201d His new book, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, written with Nate Soares, president of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, lays out wild claims, with little evidence, that unless we pull the plug on development, near-future AGI will lead to global Armageddon. The pair\u2019s position is extreme: They argue that an international ban should be enforced at all costs, up to and including the point of nuclear retaliation. After all, \u201cdatacenters can kill more people than nuclear weapons,\u201d Yudkowsky and Soares write.",
    "This stuff is no longer niche. The book is an NYT bestseller and comes with endorsements from national security experts such as Suzanne Spaulding, a former US Department of Homeland Security official, and Fiona Hill, former senior director of the White House National Security Council, who now advises the UK government; celebrity scientists such as Max Tegmark and George Church; and other household names, including Stephen Fry, Mark Ruffalo, and Grimes. Yudkowsky now has a megaphone.\u00a0 Still, it is those early quiet words in certain ears that may prove most consequential. Yudkowsky is credited with introducing Thiel to DeepMind\u2019s founders, after which Thiel became one of the first big investors in the company. Having merged with Google, it is now the in-house AI lab for the tech colossus Alphabet.\u00a0 Alongside Musk, Thiel was also instrumental in setting up OpenAI in 2015, sinking millions into a startup founded on the singular ambition to build AGI\u2014and make it safe. In 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: \u201celiezer has IMO done more to accelerate AGI than anyone else. certainly he got many of us interested in AGI.\u201d Yudkowsky might one day deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for that, Altman added. But by this point, Thiel had apparently grown wary of the \u201cAI safety people\u201d and the power they were gaining. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe in that stuff,\u201d he is reported to have told Altman at a dinner party in late 2023. \u201cYou need to take this more seriously.\u201d Altman \u201ctried not to roll his eyes,\u201d according to Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey.  OpenAI is now the most valuable private company in the world, worth half a trillion dollars.\u00a0 And the transformation is complete: Like all the most powerful conspiracies, AGI has slipped into the mainstream and taken hold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The great AGI conspiracy\u00a0 The term \u201cAGI\u201d may have been popularized less than 20 years ago, but the mythmaking behind it has been there since the start of the computer age\u2014a cosmic microwave background of chutzpah and marketing.\u00a0 Alan Turing asked if machines could think only five years after the first electronic computer, ENIAC, was built in 1945. And here\u2019s Turing a little later, in a 1951 radio broadcast: \u201cIt seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.\u201d Then, in 1955, the computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues applied for US government funding to create what they fatefully chose to call \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d\u2014a canny spin, given that computers at the time were the size of a room and as dumb as a thermostat. Even so, as McCarthy wrote in that funding application: \u201cAn attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.\u201d It\u2019s this myth that\u2019s the root of the AGI conspiracy. A smarter-than-human machine that can do it all is not a technology. It\u2019s a dream, unmoored from reality. Once you see that, other parallels with conspiracy thinking start to leap out. It\u2019s impossible to debunk a shape-shifting idea like AGI.\u00a0 Talking about AGI can sometimes feel like arguing with an enthusiastic Redditor about what drugs (or particles in the sky) are controlling your mind. Each point has a counterpoint that tries to chip away at your own sense of what\u2019s true. Ultimately, it\u2019s a clash of worldviews, not an exchange of evidence-based reason. AGI is like that, too\u2014it\u2019s slippery.\u00a0  Part of the issue is that despite all the money, all the talk, nobody knows how to build it. More than that: Most people don\u2019t even agree on what AGI really is\u2014which helps explain how people can get away with telling us it can both save the world and end it. At the core of most definitions you\u2019ll find the idea of a machine that can match humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. (And remember, superintelligence is AGI\u2019s shiny new upgrade: a machine that can outmatch us.) But even that\u2019s easy to pull apart: What humans are we talking about? What kind of cognitive task? And how wide a range?  \u201cThere\u2019s no real definition of it,\u201d says Christopher Symons, chief artificial intelligence scientist at the AI health-care startup Lirio and former head of the computer science and math division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. \u201cIf you say \u2018human-level intelligence,\u2019 that could be an infinite number of things\u2014everybody\u2019s level of intelligence is slightly different.\u201d\u00a0 And so, says Symons, we\u2019re in this weird race to build \u2026 what, exactly? \u201cWhat are you trying to get it to do?\u201d  Related StoryArtificial general intelligence: Are we close, and does it even make sense to try?Read next In 2023, a team of researchers at Google DeepMind, including Legg, had a go at categorizing various definitions that people had proposed for AGI. Some said that a machine had to be able to learn; some said that it had to be able to make money; some said that it had to have a body and move about in the world (and maybe make coffee).\u00a0\u00a0  Legg told me that when he\u2019d suggested the term to Goertzel for the title of his book, the hand-waviness had been kind of the point. \u201cI didn\u2019t have an especially clear definition. I didn\u2019t really feel it was necessary,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI was actually thinking of it more as a field of study, rather than an artifact.\u201d So, I guess we\u2019ll know it when we see it? The problem is that some people think they\u2019ve seen it already.  In 2023, a team of Microsoft researchers put out a paper in which they described their experiences playing around with a prerelease version of OpenAI\u2019s large language model GPT-4. They called it \u201cSparks of Artificial General Intelligence\u201d\u2014and it polarized the industry.\u00a0 It was a moment when a lot of researchers were blown away and trying to come to terms with what they were seeing. \u201cShit was working better than they had expected it to,\u201d says Goertzel. \u201cThe concept of AGI genuinely started to seem more plausible.\u201d And yet for all of LLMs\u2019 remarkable wordplay, Goertzel doesn\u2019t think that they do in fact contain sparks of AGI. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising to me that some people with a deep technical understanding of how these tools work under the hood still think that they could become human-level AGI,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the other hand, you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s not true.\u201d And there it is: You can\u2019t prove it\u2019s not true. \u201cThe idea that AGI is coming and that it\u2019s right around the corner and that it\u2019s inevitable has licensed a great many departures from reality,\u201d says the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Vallor. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t have any evidence for it.\u201d Conspiracy thinking looms again. Predictions about when AGI will arrive are made with the precision of numerologists counting down to the end of days. With no real stakes in the game, deadlines come and go with a shrug. Excuses are made and timelines are adjusted yet again. We saw this when OpenAI released the much-hyped GPT-5 this summer. AI stans were disappointed that the new version of the company\u2019s flagship technology wasn\u2019t the step change they expected. But instead of seeing that as evidence that AGI wasn\u2019t attainable\u2014or attainable with an LLM, at least\u2014believers pushed out their predictions for how soon AGI would come. It was coming\u2014just, you know, next time.  Maybe they\u2019re right. Or maybe people will pick whatever evidence they can to defend an idea and overlook evidence that counts against it. Jeremy Cohen, who studies conspiracy thinking in technology circles at McMaster University in Canada, calls this imperfect evidence gathering\u2014a hallmark of conspiracy thinking. Cohen started his research career in the Arizona desert, studying a community called People Unlimited that believed its members were immortal. The conviction was impervious to contrary evidence. When its members died of natural causes (including two of its founders), the thinking was that they must have deserved it. \u201cThe general consensus was that every death was a suicide,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cIf you are immortal and you get cancer and you die\u2014well, you must have done something wrong.\u201d Cohen has since been focused on transhumanism (the idea that technology can help humans push past their natural limitations) and AGI. \u201cI am seeing a lot of parallels. There are forms of magical thinking that I think is a part of the popular imagination around AGI,\u201d he says. \u201cIt connects really well to the kinds of religious imaginaries that you see in conspiracy thinking today.\u201d The believers are in on the AGI secret.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe some of you think I\u2019m an idiot: You don\u2019t get it at all lol. But that\u2019s kind of my point. There are insiders and outsiders. When I talk to researchers or engineers who are happy to drop AGI into the conversation as a given, it\u2019s like they know something I don\u2019t. But nobody\u2019s ever been able to tell me what that something is.\u00a0 The truth is out there, if you know where to look. Conspiracy theories are primarily concerned about revealing a hidden truth, Cohen tells me: \u201cIt\u2019s a really fundamental part of conspiracy thinking, and that\u2019s absolutely something that you see in the way people talk about AGI,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Last year, a 23-year-old former OpenAI staffer turned investor, Leopold Aschenbrenner, published a much-dissected 165-page manifesto titled \u201cSituational Awareness.\u201d You don\u2019t need to read it to get the idea: You either see the truth of what\u2019s coming or you don\u2019t. And you don\u2019t need cold, hard facts, either\u2014it\u2019s enough to feel it. Those who don\u2019t just haven\u2019t seen the light.\u00a0\u00a0 This idea stalked the periphery of my conversation with Goertzel, too. When I pushed him on why people are skeptical of AGI, for instance, he said: \u201cBefore every major technical achievement, from human flight to electrical power, loads of wise pundits would tell you why it was never going to happen. The fact is, most people only believe what they see in front of their faces.\u201d\u00a0 That makes AGI sound like an article of faith. I put that to Krueger, who believes AGI\u2019s arrival is maybe five years out. He scoffed: \u201cI think that\u2019s completely backwards.\u201d For him, the article of faith is the idea that it won\u2019t happen\u2014it\u2019s the skeptics who continue to deny the obvious. (Even so, he hedges: No one knows for sure, he says, but there\u2019s no obvious reason that AGI won\u2019t come.)\u00a0  Hidden truths bring truth seekers, bent on revealing what they\u2019ve been able to see all along. With AGI, though, it\u2019s not enough to uncover something hidden. Here, revelation requires an unprecedented act of creation. If you believe AGI is achievable, then you believe that those making it are midwives to machines that will match or surpass human intelligence. \u201cThe idea of giving birth to machine gods is obviously very flattering to the ego,\u201d says Vallor. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly seductive thing to think that you yourself are laying the early foundations for that transcendence.\u201d\u00a0 It's yet another overlap with conspiracy thinking. Part of the draw is the desire for a sense of purpose in an otherwise messy world that can feel meaningless\u2014the longing to be a person of consequence.\u00a0 Krueger, who is based in Berkeley, says he knows people working on AI who see the technology as our natural successor. \u201cThey view it as akin to having children or something,\u201d he says. \u201cSide note: they usually don\u2019t have children.\u201d AGI will be our one true savior (or it\u2019ll bring the apocalypse).\u00a0 Cohen sees parallels between many modern conspiracy theories and the New Age movement, which reached its peak of influence in the 1970s and \u201980s. Adherents believed humanity was on the cusp of unlocking an era of spiritual well-being and expanded consciousness that would usher in a more peaceful and prosperous world. In a nutshell, the idea was that by engaging in a set of pseudo-religious practices, including astrology and the careful curation of crystals, humans would transcend their limitations and enter a kind of hippie utopia. Today\u2019s tech industry is built on compute, not crystals, but its sense of what\u2019s at stake is no less transcendent: \u201cYou know, this idea that there is going to be this fundamental shift, there\u2019s going to be this millenarian turn where we end up in a techno-utopian future,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cAnd the idea that AGI is going to ultimately allow humanity to overcome the problems that face us.\u201d In many people\u2019s telling, AGI will arrive all at once. Incremental advances in AI will stack up until, one day, AI will be good enough to start making better AI by itself. At which point\u2014FOOM\u2014it will advance so rapidly that AGI will arrive in what\u2019s often called an intelligence explosion, leading to a point of no return known as the Singularity, a goofy term that\u2019s been popular in AGI circles for years. Co-opting a concept from physics, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge first introduced the idea of a technological singularity in the 1980s. Vinge imagined an event horizon on the path of technological progress beyond which humans would be fast outstripped by the exponential self-improvement of the machines they had created.\u00a0  Call it the AI Big Bang\u2014which, again, gives us a before and an after, a transcendent moment when humanity as we know it changes forever (for good or bad). \u201cPeople imagine it as an event,\u201d says Grace from AI Impacts. For Vallor, this belief system is notable for the way that a faith in technology has replaced a faith in humans. Despite the woo-woo, New Age thinking was at least motivated by the idea that people had what it took to change the world by themselves, if they could only tap into it. With the pursuit of AGI, we\u2019ve left that self-belief behind and bought into the idea that only technology can save us, she says.\u00a0\u00a0   That\u2019s a compelling\u2014even comforting\u2014thought for many people. \u201cWe\u2019re in an era where other paths to material improvement of human lives and our societies seem to have been exhausted,\u201d Vallor says.\u00a0 Technology once promised a route to a better future: Progress was a ladder that we would climb toward human and social flourishing. \u201cWe\u2019ve passed the peak of that,\u201d says Vallor. \u201cI think the one thing that gives many people hope and a return to that kind of optimism about the future is AGI.\u201d Push this idea to its conclusion and, again, AGI becomes a kind of god\u2014one that can offer relief from earthly suffering, says Vallor.  Kelly Joyce, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how cultural, political, and economic beliefs shape the way we think about and use technology, sees all these wild predictions about AGI as something more banal: part of a long-term pattern of overpromising from the tech industry. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that we get sucked in every time,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a deep belief that technology is better than human beings.\u201d Joyce thinks that\u2019s why, when the hype kicks in, people are predisposed to believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s a religion,\u201d she says. \u201cWe believe in technology. Technology is God. It\u2019s really hard to push back against it. People don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d How AGI hijacked an industry The fantasy of computers that can do almost anything a person can is seductive. But like many pervasive conspiracy theories, it has very real consequences. It has distorted the way we think about the stakes behind the current technology boom (and potential bust). It may have even derailed the industry, sucking resources away from more immediate, more practical application of the technology. More than anything else, it gives us a free pass to be lazy. It fools us into thinking we might be able to avoid the actual hard work needed to solve intractable, world-spanning problems\u2014problems that will require international cooperation and compromise and expensive aid. Why bother with that when we\u2019ll soon have machines to figure it all out for us? Consider the resources being sunk into this grand project. Just last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced an up-to-$100 billion partnership that would see the chip giant supply at least 10 gigawatts of ChatGPT\u2019s insatiable demand. That\u2019s higher than nuclear power plant numbers. A bolt of lightning might release that much energy. The flux capacitor inside Dr. Emmett Brown\u2019s DeLorean time machine only required 1.2 gigawatts to send Marty back to the future. And then, only two weeks later, OpenAI announced a second partnership with chipmaker AMD for another six gigawatts of power. Promoting the Nvidia deal on CNBC, Altman, straight-faced, claimed that without this kind of data center buildout, people would have to choose between a cure for cancer and free education. \u201cNo one wants to make that choice,\u201d he said. (Just a few weeks later, he announced that erotic chats would be coming to ChatGPT.) Add to those costs the loss of investment in more immediate technology that could change lives today and tomorrow and the next day. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a huge missed opportunity,\u201d says Lirio\u2019s Symons, \u201cto put all these resources into solving something nebulous when we already know there\u2019s real problems that we could solve.\u201d\u00a0 But that\u2019s not how the likes of OpenAI needs to operate. \u201cWith people throwing so much money at these companies, they don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Symons says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got hundreds of billions of dollars, you don\u2019t have to focus on a practical, solvable project.\u201d Despite his steadfast belief that AGI is coming, Krueger also thinks the industry's single-minded pursuit of it means that potential solutions to real problems, such as better health care, are being ignored. \u201cThis AGI stuff\u2014it\u2019s nonsense, it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s hype,\u201d he tells me.\u00a0  And there are consequences for the way governments support and regulate technology (or don\u2019t). Tina Law, who studies technology policy at the University of California\u2013Davis, worries that policymakers are getting lobbied about the ways AI will one day kill us all, instead of addressing real concerns about the ways AI could impact people\u2019s lives in immediate and material ways today. Inequality has been sidetracked by existential risk. \u201cHype is a lucrative strategy for tech firms,\u201d says Law. A big part of that hype is the idea that what\u2019s happening is inevitable: If we don\u2019t build it, someone else will. \u201cWhen something is framed as inevitable,\u201d Law says, \u201cpeople doubt not only whether they should resist but also whether they have the capacity to do so.\u201d Everyone gets locked in.\u00a0 The AGI distortion field isn\u2019t limited to tech policy, says Milton Mueller at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who works on technology policy and regulation. The race to AGI gets compared to the race to the atomic bomb, he says. \u201cSo whoever gets it first is going to have ultimate power over everybody else. That\u2019s a crazy and dangerous idea that really will distort our approach to foreign policy.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s a business incentive for companies (and governments) to push the myth of AGI, says Mueller, because they can then claim that they will be the first to get there. But because they\u2019re running a race in which nobody has agreed on the finish line, the myth can be spun as long as it\u2019s useful. Or as long as investors are willing to buy into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not hard to see how this plays out. It\u2019s not utopia or hell\u2014it\u2019s OpenAI and its peers making a whole lot more money. The great AGI conspiracy, concluded\u00a0 And maybe that brings us back to the whole conspiracy thing\u2014and a late-game twist in this tale. So far we\u2019ve ignored one popular feature of conspiracy thinking: that there\u2019s a group of powerful figures pulling the levers behind the scenes and that, by seeking the truth, believers can expose this elite cabal.\u00a0  Sure, the people feeling the AGI aren\u2019t publicly accusing any Illuminati or WEF-like force of preventing the AGI future or withholding its secrets.\u00a0 But what if there are, in fact, shadowy puppet masters here\u2014and they\u2019re the very people who have pushed the AGI conspiracy hardest all along? The kings of Silicon Valley are throwing everything they can get at building AGI for profit. The myth of AGI serves their interests more than anybody else\u2019s.\u00a0 As one senior executive at an AI company said to us recently, AGI always needs to be six months to a year away, because if it\u2019s any further than that, you won\u2019t be able to recruit people from Jane Street, and if it\u2019s closer to already here, then what\u2019s the point?\u00a0  As Vallor puts it: \u201cIf OpenAI says they\u2019re building a machine that\u2019s going to make corporations even more powerful than they are today, that isn\u2019t going to get the kind of public buy-in that they need.\u201d\u00a0 Remember: You create a god and you become like one yourself. Krueger says there\u2019s a line of thinking running through Silicon Valley in which building AI is a way to seize huge amounts of power. (It\u2019s one of the premises of Aschenbrenner\u2019s \u201cSituational Awareness,\u201d for example.) \u201cYou know, we\u2019re going to have this godlike power and we\u2019re going to have to figure out what to do with it,\u201d says Krueger. \u201cA lot of people think if they get there first, they can basically take over the world.\u201d \u201cThey're putting so much effort into selling their vision of a future with AGI in it, and they\u2019re having a pretty good amount of success because they have so much power,\u201d he adds. Goertzel, for one, is almost lamenting how successful the maybe-cabal has been. He\u2019s actually starting to miss life on the fringes. \u201cIn my generation, you had to have a lot of vision to want to work on AGI, and you had to be very stubborn,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s almost, like, what your grandma tells you to do to get a job instead of being a business major.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s disorienting that this stuff is so broadly accepted,\u201d he says. \u201cIt almost gives me the desire to go work on something else that not so many people are doing.\u201d He\u2019s half joking (I think): \u201cObviously, putting the finishing touches to AGI is more important than gratifying my preference to be out on the frontier.\u201d But I'm no clearer on what exactly they\u2019re putting the finishing touches on. What does it mean for technology in general if we fall so hard for the fairy tales? In a lot of ways, I think the whole idea of AGI is built on a warped view of what we should expect technology to do, and even what intelligence is in the first place. Stripped back to its essentials, the argument for AGI rests on the premise that one technology, AI, has gotten very good, very fast, and will continue to get better. But set aside the technical objections\u2014what if it doesn't continue to get better?\u2014and you\u2019re left with the claim that intelligence is a commodity you can get more of if you have the right data or compute or neural network. And it\u2019s not.\u00a0 Intelligence doesn\u2019t come as a quantity you can just ratchet up and up. Smart people may be brilliant in one area and not in others. Some Nobel Prize winners are really bad at playing the piano or caring for their kids. Some very smart people insist that AGI is coming next year.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard not to wonder what will get its hooks into us next.\u00a0 Before we ended our call, Goertzel told me about an event he\u2019d just been to in San Francisco on AI consciousness and parapsychology: \u201cESP, precognition, and whatnot.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where AGI was 20 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s batshit crazy.\u201d hide"
