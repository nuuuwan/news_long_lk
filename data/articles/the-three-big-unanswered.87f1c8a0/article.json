    "Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long. The app allows you to create a \u201ccameo\u201d of yourself\u2014a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice\u2014and insert other peoples\u2019 cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set).\u00a0 To some people who believed earnestly in OpenAI\u2019s promise to build AI that benefits all of humanity, the app is a punchline. A former OpenAI researcher who left to build an AI-for-science startup referred to Sora as an \u201cinfinite AI tiktok slop machine.\u201d\u00a0  That hasn\u2019t stopped it from soaring to the top spot on Apple\u2019s US App Store. After I downloaded the app, I quickly learned what types of videos are, at least currently, performing well: bodycam-style footage of police pulling over pets or various trademarked characters, including SpongeBob and Scooby Doo; deepfake memes of Martin Luther King Jr. talking about Xbox; and endless variations of Jesus Christ navigating our modern world.\u00a0 Just as quickly, I had a bunch of questions about what\u2019s coming next for Sora. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned so far.",
    "Can it last? OpenAI is betting that a sizable number of people will want to spend time on an app in which you can suspend your concerns about whether what you\u2019re looking at is fake and indulge in a stream of raw AI. One reviewer put it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s comforting because you know that everything you\u2019re scrolling through isn\u2019t real, where other platforms you sometimes have to guess if it\u2019s real or fake. Here, there is no guessing, it\u2019s all AI, all the time.\" This may sound like hell to some. But judging by Sora\u2019s popularity, lots of people want it.",
    "So what\u2019s drawing these people in? There are two explanations. One is that Sora is a flash-in-the-pan gimmick, with people lining up to gawk at what cutting-edge AI can create now (in my experience, this is interesting for about five minutes). The second, which OpenAI is betting on, is that we\u2019re witnessing a genuine shift in what type of content can draw eyeballs, and that users will stay with Sora because it allows a level of fantastical creativity not possible in any other app.\u00a0 There are a few decisions down the pike that may shape how many people stick around: how OpenAI decides to implement ads, what limits it sets for copyrighted content (see below), and what algorithms it cooks up to decide who sees what.\u00a0 Can OpenAI afford it? OpenAI is not profitable, but that\u2019s not particularly strange given how Silicon Valley operates. What is peculiar, though, is that the company is investing in a platform for generating video, which is the most energy-intensive (and therefore expensive) form of AI we have. The energy it takes dwarfs the amount required to create images or answer text questions via ChatGPT. This isn\u2019t news to OpenAI, which has joined a half-trillion-dollar project to build data centers and new power plants. But Sora\u2014which currently allows you to generate AI videos, for free, without limits\u2014raises the stakes: How much will it cost the company?\u00a0 Related StoryHow do AI models generate videos?With powerful video generation tools now in the hands of more people than ever, let's take a look at how they work.",
    "OpenAI is making moves toward monetizing things (you can now buy products directly through ChatGPT, for example). On October 3, its CEO, Sam Altman, wrote in a blog post that \u201cwe are going to have to somehow make money for video generation,\u201d but he didn\u2019t get into specifics. One can imagine personalized ads and more in-app purchases.\u00a0 Still, it\u2019s concerning to imagine the mountain of emissions might result if Sora becomes popular. Altman has accurately described the emissions burden of one query to ChatGPT as impossibly small. What he has not quantified is what that figure is for a 10-second video generated by Sora. It\u2019s only a matter of time until AI and climate researchers start demanding it.\u00a0 How many lawsuits are coming?\u00a0 Sora is awash in copyrighted and trademarked characters. It allows you to easily deepfake deceased celebrities. Its videos use copyrighted music.\u00a0 Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI has sent letters to copyright holders notifying them that they\u2019ll have to opt out of the Sora platform if they don\u2019t want their material included, which is not how these things usually work. The law on how AI companies should handle copyrighted material is far from settled, and it\u2019d be reasonable to expect lawsuits challenging this.",
    "In last week\u2019s blog post, Altman wrote that OpenAI is \u201chearing from a lot of rightsholders\u201d who want more control over how their characters are used in Sora. He says that the company plans to give those parties more \u201cgranular control\u201d over their characters. Still, \u201cthere may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he wrote. But another issue is the ease with which you can use the cameos of real people. People can restrict who can use their cameo, but what limits will there be for what these cameos can be made to do in Sora videos?\u00a0 This is apparently already an issue OpenAI is being forced to respond to. The head of Sora, Bill Peebles, posted on October 5 that users can now restrict how their cameo can be used\u2014preventing it from appearing in political videos or saying certain words, for example. How well will this work? Is it only a matter of time until someone\u2019s cameo is used for something nefarious, explicit, illegal, or at least creepy, sparking a lawsuit alleging that OpenAI is responsible?\u00a0 Overall, we haven\u2019t seen what full-scale Sora looks like yet (OpenAI is still doling out access to the app via invite codes). When we do, I think it will serve as a grim test: Can AI create videos so fine-tuned for endless engagement that they\u2019ll outcompete \u201creal\u201d videos for our attention? In the end, Sora isn\u2019t just testing OpenAI\u2019s technology\u2014it\u2019s testing us, and how much of our reality we\u2019re willing to trade for an infinite scroll of simulation. hide"
