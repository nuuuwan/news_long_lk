    "At the inauguration of the conference",
    "Sri Lankan Oppostion party delegates with Chinese Minister of International Development",
    "As our plane touched down at Beijing Capital International Airport, the magnitude of the invitation extended by the Communist Party of China (CPC) was beginning to sink in!",
    "Together with fellow political delegates from Sri Lanka and other Asian nations, we had been given a front-row seat to witness the socio-political and economic transformation of a global giant from the inside. It was more than a diplomatic visit\u2014it was an ideological awakening.",
    "The week-long journey from 24 May to 1 June, spanning the power corridors of Beijing to the cultural serenity of Yunnan Province, gave us unparalleled access to the workings of the CPC and Chinese governance. It was an experience marked by deep reflection, candid exchanges, and compelling observations that challenged long-held perceptions. For me representing Sri Lanka\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the takeaways were transformative.",
    "A ceremony of shared vision in Beijing",
    "On the morning of 25 May, we were ushered into a grand ceremonial hall of the Communist Party of China, at the heart of Beijing. The meeting, hosted by Liu Jianchao, Minister of the International Department of the Central Committee of the CPC, set the tone for a pan-Asian political dialogue of historical significance.",
    "Flanked by leaders such as Ahmad Muzani of Indonesia, Bidhya Devi Bandari of Nepal, Kim Rithy of Cambodia, and Aktam Khaitov of Uzbekistan, the focus was unmistakable\u2014 \u201cAsia in a Changing World.\u201d",
    "Minister Jianchao\u2019s keynote struck a resonant chord. His emphasis on proactive cooperation, regional mutual trust, and the vision of a shared Asian future underscored China\u2019s commitment to multilateral engagement based on mutual benefit and cultural respect. The thought-provoking dialogue that followed\u2014featuring political stalwarts like Damdin Tsogtbaatar of Mongolia and Mushahid Hussain Sayed of Pakistan\u2014reminded us that Asia must rise together, not be divided by Western narratives or domestic indecision.",
    "Lessons in political discipline and organisational integrity",
    "Among the most profound insights from our engagement with the CPC was their unwavering focus on internal party discipline, ideological clarity, and integrity.",
    "As Deng Xiaoping once said, \u201cCorrecting mistaken ideas in the Party\u201d is vital. Chinese officials shared that this self-correction that ethos enabled the CPC to regain public trust and credibility. From grassroots organisation, to the Central Committee, the message was clear: a political party must first command internal respect before earning public confidence.",
    "There was a particular resonance when they described ideological education not just as rhetoric, but as a binding force that prevents internal contradictions. In Sri Lanka, where ideological ambiguity is common, this was an important reminder\u2014a rudderless party cannot promise direction to the people.",
    "Moreover, CPC officials stressed that closeness to the people, resistance to corruption, and an emphasis on hard work are not just ideals but enforced mandates. At the community level, \u201cwork styles\u201d are not abstract concepts but measurable practices. This grassroots engagement reminded us that credibility must be earned from the bottom up.",
    "China\u2019s multi-front transformation: A first-hand view",
    "Social Frontier: Dignity in everyday life",
    "What stood out starkly was the culture of mutual respect that permeated Chinese society. In Yunnan Province, we witnessed how Community Centres functioned as dynamic social hubs\u2014offering redress, education, and emotional support. These are not ceremonial establishments but institutions of real community empowerment. The sense of human dignity, infused with traditional Confucian values, made a deep impression on us.",
    "The feasts laid out for us at every meal in luxurious hotels were astounding with an amazing variety of dishes of the highest quality. The care and hospitality demonstrated to us by our Chinese hosts was unforgettable. They paid attention to the most minute details to ensure our comfort.",
    "Economic Frontier: Growth with conscience",
    "In Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, economic growth was evident\u2014but not chaotic or unsustainable. China\u2019s \u201cSocialist Market Economy\u201d operates on dual axes: development and inclusion. Urban landscapes were clean, orderly, and green. Policies prioritise healthcare, education, and poverty alleviation\u2014not as vote-catching slogans, but as state strategy. It was an economy growing not just for GDP numbers, but for people.",
    "A city tour in a driver-less car driven by a robot and a pharmacy prescription being administered by a robot, devoid of human intervention left me spell- bound.",
    "Political Frontier: Action with credibility",
    "The CPC, as we observed, treats credibility as the cornerstone of governance. Bureaucrats and political leaders are judged on integrity and delivery\u2014not lineage or allegiance. The Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative are not merely diplomacy tools but extensions of China\u2019s strategic vision for regional peace and cooperation.",
    "We were particularly moved by their seriousness in combatting nepotism and cronyism. In China, political maturity means the meritocracy is protected\u2014not just in words but by mechanisms.",
    "Cultural Frontier: Modernisation with roots",
    "One might expect a fast-modernising society to lean heavily into Western models. China does the opposite. The Confucian ethic\u2014emphasising harmony, hierarchy, and education\u2014remains central. The result is a modernisation journey that is at once contemporary and rooted. It respects collective progress, family values, and social order, making it relevant to other Asian nations, including ours.",
    "A Sri Lankan delegation united by curiosity and respect",
    "One of the heartwarming aspects of the trip was the camaraderie among the three Sri Lankan political party representatives \u2014 Government and Opposition alike. From the moment our small delegation of six members left Colombo, on 23 May, there was a shared sense of purpose and feeling of solidarity as Sri Lankans.",
    "Discussions with Gamagedera Dissanaike, Deputy Minister of Cultural and Religious Affairs, Dr. Malshani Hettiarcahchi and Chandrika Adhikari of the JVP central committee reaffirmed our mutual concern over Sri Lanka\u2019s moral and cultural stagnation. Drawing from Singapore\u2019s National Courtesy Campaign, we discussed how shared values could drive national unity.",
    "Meanwhile, long conversations and excursions with UNP\u2019s Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene and Milinda Rajapakshe, of the Pohottuwa Central Committee, highlighted a growing consensus across party lines on the importance of ideological clarity and respectful discourse in Sri Lanka\u2019s future political culture.",
    "A highlight of our visit was meeting the distinguished Sri Lankan Ambassador to China, Majintha Jayesinghe and Counsellor Niranga Palipana who graciously hosted us to a delicious Chinese dinner and Chinese cultural evening. We were impressed by his high level of professionalism as a senior career diplomat.",
    "Conclusion: A shared future awaits",
    "As Minister Liu Jianchao reminded us in Beijing, the future of Asia lies not in division but in dialogue. China has extended a hand in partnership, not paternalism. It is now upon us\u2014especially those of us in leadership\u2014to shape a new path that is rooted in pragmatism, respect, and ideological clarity.",
    "If there is one thing this visit taught us, it is this: The time to look East with open minds and full hearts is now.",
    "(The writer is a Central Committee Member of SJB, in Political Party Delegation to the People\u2019s Republic of China, from 25 May to 1 June 2025.)"
