    "Happy birthday, baby. You have been born into an era of intelligent machines. They have watched over you almost since your conception. They let your parents listen in on your tiny heartbeat, track your gestation on an app, and post your sonogram on social media. Well before you were born, you were known to the algorithm.\u00a0  Your arrival coincided with the 125th anniversary of this magazine. With a bit of luck and the right genes, you might see the next 125 years. How will you and the next generation of machines grow up together? We asked more than a dozen experts to imagine your joint future. We explained that this would be a thought experiment. What I mean is: We asked them to get weird.\u00a0 Just about all of them agreed on how to frame the past: Computing shrank from giant shared industrial mainframes to personal desktop devices to electronic shrapnel so small it\u2019s ambient in the environment. Previously controlled at arm\u2019s length through punch card, keyboard, or mouse, computing became wearable, moving onto\u2014and very recently into\u2014the body. In our time, eye or brain implants are only for medical aid; in your time, who knows?",
    "In the future, everyone thinks, computers will get smaller and more plentiful still. But the biggest change in your lifetime will be the rise of intelligent agents. Computing will be more responsive, more intimate, less confined to any one platform. It will be less like a tool, and more like a companion. It will learn from you and also be your guide. What they mean, baby, is that it\u2019s going to be your friend.",
    "Present day to 2034\u00a0Age 0 to 10 When you were born, your family surrounded you with \u201csmart\u201d things: rockers, monitors, lamps that play lullabies. \u00a0  DAVID BISKUP   But not a single expert name-checked those as your first exposure to technology. Instead, they mentioned your parents\u2019 phone or smart watch. And why not? As your loved ones cradle you, that deliciously blinky thing is right there. Babies learn by trial and error, by touching objects to see what happens. You tap it; it lights up or makes noise. Fascinating!  Cognitively, you won\u2019t get much out of that interaction between birth and age two, says Jason Yip, an associate professor of digital youth at the University of Washington. But it helps introduce you to a world of animate objects, says Sean Follmer, director of the SHAPE Lab in Stanford\u2019s mechanical engineering department, which explores haptics in robotics and computing. If you touch something, how does it respond? You are the child of millennials and Gen Z\u2014digital natives, the first influencers. So as you grow, cameras are ubiquitous. You see yourself onscreen and learn to smile or wave to the people on the other side. Your grandparents read to you on FaceTime; you photobomb Zoom meetings. As you get older, you\u2019ll realize that images of yourself are a kind of social currency.\u00a0 Related StoryThe pain is real. The painkillers are virtual reality.Immersing patients in virtual worlds can reduce the pain of a needle stick as well as more pernicious chronic pain.",
    "Your primary school will certainly have computers, though we\u2019re not sure how educators will balance real-world and onscreen instruction, a pedagogical debate today. But baby, school is where our experts think you will meet your first intelligent agent, in the form of a tutor or coach. Your AI tutor might guide you through activities that combine physical tasks with augmented-\u00adreality instruction\u2014a sort of middle ground.\u00a0 Some school libraries are becoming more like makerspaces, teaching critical thinking along with building skills, says Nesra Yannier, a faculty member in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. She is developing NoRILLA, an educational system that uses mixed reality\u2014a combination of physical and virtual reality\u2014to teach science and engineering concepts. For example, kids build wood-block structures and predict, with feedback from a cartoon AI gorilla, how they will fall.\u00a0 Learning will be increasingly self-\u00addirected, says Liz Gerber, co-director of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction and Design at Northwestern University. The future classroom is \u201cgoing to be hyper-\u00adpersonalized.\u201d AI tutors could help with one-on-one instruction or repetitive sports drills.\u00a0 All of this is pretty novel, so our experts had to guess at future form factors. Maybe while you\u2019re learning, an unobtrusive bracelet or smart watch tracks your performance and then syncs data with a tablet, so your tutor can help you practice.",
    "What will that agent be like? Follmer, who has worked with blind and low-vision students, thinks it might just be a voice. Yannier is partial to an animated character. Gerber thinks a digital avatar could be paired with a physical version, like a stuffed animal\u2014in whatever guise you like. \u201cIt\u2019s an imaginary friend,\u201d says Gerber. \u201cYou get to decide who it is.\u201d\u00a0 Not everybody is sold on the AI tutor. In Yip\u2019s research, kids often tell him AI-enabled technologies are \u2026 creepy. They feel unpredictable or scary or like they seem to be watching.\u00a0 Kids learn through social interactions, so he\u2019s also worried about technologies that isolate. And while he thinks AI can handle the cognitive aspects of tutoring, he\u2019s not sure about its social side. Good teachers know how to motivate, how to deal with human moods and biology. Can a machine tell when a child is being sarcastic, or redirect a kid who is goofing off in the bathroom? When confronted with a meltdown, he asks, \u201cis the AI going to know this kid is hungry and needs a snack?\u201d 2040Age 16 By the time you turn 16, you\u2019ll likely still live in a world shaped by cars: highways, suburbs, climate change. But some parts of car culture may be changing. Electric chargers might be supplanting gas stations. And just as an intelligent agent assisted in your schooling, now one will drive with you\u2014and probably for you. \u00a0  Paola Meraz, a creative director of interaction design at BMW\u2019s Designworks, describes that agent as \u201cyour friend on the road.\u201d William Chergosky, chief designer at Calty Design Research, Toyota\u2019s North American design studio, calls it \u201cexactly like a friend in the car.\u201d While you are young, Chergosky says, it\u2019s your chaperone, restricting your speed or routing you home at curfew. It tells you when you\u2019re near In-N-Out, knowing your penchant for their animal fries. And because you want to keep up with your friends online and in the real world, the agent can comb your social media feeds to see where they are and suggest a meetup.\u00a0  Just as an intelligent agent assisted in your schooling, now one will drive with you\u2014and probably for you.  Cars have long been spots for teen hangouts, but as driving becomes more autonomous, their interiors can become more like living rooms. (You\u2019ll no longer need to face the road and an instrument panel full of knobs.) Meraz anticipates seats that reposition so passengers can talk face to face, or game. \u201cImagine playing a game that interacts with the world that you are driving through,\u201d she says, or \u201ca movie that was designed where speed, time of day, and geographical elements could influence the storyline.\u201d\u00a0  DAVID BISKUP   Without an instrument panel, how do you control the car? Today\u2019s minimalist interiors feature a dash-mounted tablet, but digging through endless onscreen menus is not terribly intuitive. The next step is probably gestural or voice control\u2014ideally, through natural language. The tipping point, says Chergosky, will come when instead of giving detailed commands, you can just say: \u201cMan, it is hot in here. Can you make it cooler?\u201d",
    "An agent that listens in and tracks your every move raises some strange questions. Will it change personalities for each driver? (Sure.) Can it keep a secret? (\u201cDad said he went to Taco Bell, but did he?\u201d jokes Chergosky.) Does it even have to stay in the car?\u00a0 Our experts say nope. Meraz imagines it being integrated with other kinds of agents\u2014the future versions of Alexa or Google Home. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected,\u201d she says. And when your car dies, Chergosky says, the agent does not. \u201cYou can actually take the soul of it from vehicle to vehicle. So as you upgrade, it\u2019s not like you cut off that relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cIt moves with you. Because it\u2019s grown with you.\u201d",
    "2049Age 25 By your mid-20s, the agents in your life know an awful lot about you. Maybe they are, indeed, a single entity that follows you across devices and offers help where you need it. At this point, the place where you need the most help is your social life.\u00a0 Kathryn Coduto, an assistant professor of media science at Boston University who studies online dating, says everyone\u2019s big worry is the opening line. To her, AI could be a disembodied Cyrano that whips up 10 options or workshops your own attempts. Or maybe it\u2019s a dating coach. You agree to meet up with a (real) person online, and \u201cyou have the AI in a corner saying \u2018Hey, maybe you should say this,\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t forget this.\u2019 Almost like a little nudge.\u201d   \u201cThere is some concern that we are going to see some people who are just like, \u2018Nope, this is all I want. Why go out and do that when I can stay home with my partner, my virtual buddy?\u2019\u201d T. Makana Chock, director, the Extended Reality Lab, Syracuse University Virtual first dates might solve one of our present-day conundrums: Apps make searching for matches easier, but you get sparse\u2014and perhaps inaccurate\u2014info about those people. How do you know who\u2019s worth meeting in real life? Building virtual dating into the app, Coduto says, could be \u201can appealing feature for a lot of daters who want to meet people but aren\u2019t sure about a large initial time investment.\u201d T. Makana Chock, who directs the Extended Reality Lab at Syracuse University, thinks things could go a step further: first dates where both parties send an AI version of themselves in their place. \u201cThat would tell both of you that this is working\u2014or this is definitely not going to work,\u201d Chock says. If the date is a dud\u2014well, at least you weren\u2019t on it. Or maybe you will just date an entirely virtual being, says Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn, who directs the Center for Advanced Computer-Human Ecosystems at the University of Georgia. Or you\u2019ll go to a virtual party, have an amazing time, \u201cand then later on you realize that you were the only real human in that entire room. Everybody else was AI.\u201d Related Story\u201cForest bathing\u201d might work in virtual reality tooCould electronic forests elicit the same physiological responses as real ones?",
    "This might sound odd, says Ahn, but \u201chumans are really good at building relationships with nonhuman entities.\u201d It\u2019s why you pour your heart out to your dog\u2014or treat ChatGPT like a therapist.",
    "There is a problem, though, when virtual relationships become too accommodating, says Chock: If you get used to agents that are tailored to please you, you get less skilled at dealing with real people and risking awkwardness or rejection. \u201cYou still need to have human interaction,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is some concern that we are going to see some people who are just like, \u2018Nope, this is all I want. Why go out and do that when I can stay home with my partner, my virtual buddy?\u2019\u201d By now, social media, online dating, and livestreaming have likely intertwined and become more immersive. Engineers have shrunk the obstacles to true telepresence: internet lag time, the uncanny valley, and clunky headsets, which may now be replaced by something more like glasses or smart contact lenses.\u00a0 Online experiences may be less like observing someone else\u2019s life and more like living it. Imagine, says Follmer: A basketball star wears clothing and skin sensors that track body position, motion, and forces, plus super-thin gloves that sense the texture of the ball. You, watching from your couch, wear a jersey and gloves made of smart textiles, woven with actuators that transmit whatever the player feels. When the athlete gets shoved, Follmer says, your fan gear \u201ccan really shove you right back.\u201d Gaming is another obvious application. But it\u2019s not the likely first mover in this space. Nobody else wants to say this on the record, so I will: It\u2019s porn. (Baby, ask your parents and/or AI tutor when you\u2019re older.)",
    "DAVID BISKUP   By your 20s, you are probably wrestling with the dilemmas of a life spent online and on camera. Coduto thinks you might rebel, opting out of social media because your parents documented your first 18 years without permission. As an adult, you\u2019ll want tighter rules for privacy and consent, better ways to verify authenticity, and more control over sensitive materials, like a button that could nuke your old sexts. But maybe it\u2019s the opposite: Now you are an influencer yourself. If so, your body can be your display space. Today, wearables are basically boxes of electronics strapped onto limbs. Tomorrow, hopes Cindy Hsin-Liu Kao, who runs the Hybrid Body Lab at Cornell University, they will be more like your own skin. Kao develops wearables like color-changing eyeshadow stickers and mini nail trackpads that can control a phone or open a car door. In the not-too-distant future, she imagines, \u201cyou might be able to rent out each of your fingernails as an ad for social media.\u201d Or maybe your hair: Weaving in super-thin programmable LED strands could make it a kind of screen.\u00a0 What if those smart lenses could be display spaces too? \u201cThat would be really creepy,\u201d she muses. \u201cJust looking into someone\u2019s eyes and it\u2019s, like, CNN.\u201d 2059Age 35 By now, you\u2019ve probably settled into domestic life\u2014but it might not look much like the home you grew up in. Keith Evan Green, a professor of human-centered design at Cornell, doesn\u2019t think we should imagine a home of the future. \u201cI would call it a room of the future,\u201d he says, because it will be the place for everything\u2014work, school, play. This trend was hastened by the covid pandemic. Your place will probably be small if you live in a big city. The uncertainties of climate change and transportation costs mean we can\u2019t build cities infinitely outward. So he imagines a reconfigurable architectural robotic space: Walls move, objects inflate or unfold, furniture appears or dissolves into surfaces or recombines. Any necessary computing power is embedded. The home will finally be what Le Corbusier imagined: a machine for living in. Green pictures this space as spartan but beautiful, like a temple\u2014a place, he says, to think and be. \u201cI would characterize it as this capacious monastic cell that is empty of most things but us,\u201d he says. Our experts think your home, like your car, will respond to voice or gestural control. But it will make some decisions autonomously, learning by observing you: your motion, location, temperature.\u00a0 Related StorySnap is launching augmented-reality mirrors in storesIt\u2019s part of a massive effort to push the technology further into the physical world.",
    "Ivan Poupyrev, CEO and cofounder of Archetype AI, says we\u2019ll no longer control each smart appliance through its own app. Instead, he says, think of the home as a stage and you as the director. \u201cYou don\u2019t interact with the air conditioner. You don\u2019t interact with a TV,\u201d he says. \u201cYou interact with the home as a total.\u201d Instead of telling the TV to play a specific program, you make high-level demands of the entire space: \u201cTurn on something interesting for me; I\u2019m tired.\u201d Or: \u201cWhat is the plan for tomorrow?\u201d  Stanford\u2019s Follmer says that just as computing went from industrial to personal to ubiquitous, so will robotics. Your great-grandparents envisioned futuristic homes cared for by a single humanoid robot\u2014like Rosie from The Jetsons. He envisions swarms of maybe 100 bots the size of quarters that materialize to clean, take out the trash, or bring you a cold drink. (\u201cThey know ahead of time, even before you do, that you\u2019re thirsty,\u201d he says.)  DAVID BISKUP   Baby, perhaps now you have your own baby. The technologies of reproduction have changed since you were born. For one thing, says Gerber, fertility tracking will be way more accurate: \u201cIt is going to be like weather prediction.\u201d Maybe, Kao says, flexible fabric-like sensors could be embedded in panty liners to track menstrual health. Or, once the baby arrives, in nipple stickers that nursing parents could apply to track biofluid exchange. If the baby has trouble latching, maybe the sticker\u2019s capacitive touch sensors could help the parent find a better position. Also, goodbye to sleep deprivation. Gerber envisions a device that, for lack of an existing term, she\u2019s calling a\u201cbaby handler\u201d\u2014picture an exoskeleton crossed with a car seat. It\u2019s a late-night soothing machine that rocks, supplies pre-pumped breast milk, and maybe offers a bidet-like \u201ccleaning and drying situation.\u201dFor your children, perhaps, this is their first experience of being close to a machine.\u00a0 2074Age 50 Now you are at the peak of your career. For professions heading toward AI automation, you may be the \u201chuman in the loop\u201d who oversees a machine doing its tasks. The 9-to-5 workday, which is crumbling in our time, might be totally atomized into work-from-home fluidity or earn-as-you-go gig work. Ahn thinks you might start the workday by lying in bed and checking your messages\u2014on an implanted contact lens. Everyone loves a big screen, and putting it in your eye effectively gives you \u201cthe largest monitor in the world,\u201d she says.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already dabbled with AI selves for dating. But now virtual agents are more photorealistic, and they can mimic your voice and mannerisms. Why not make one go to meetings for you?  DAVID BISKUP   Kori Inkpen, who studies human-\u00adcomputer interaction at Microsoft Research, calls this your \u201cditto\u201d\u2014more formally, an embodied mimetic agent, meaning it represents a specific person. \u201cMy ditto looks like me, acts like me, sounds like me, knows sort of what I know,\u201d she says. You can instruct it to raise certain points and recap the conversation for you later. Your colleagues feel as if you were there, and you get the benefit of an exchange that\u2019s not quite real time, but not as asynchronous as email. \u201cA ditto starts to blend this reality,\u201d Inkpen says. In our time, augmented reality is slowly catching on as a tool for workers whose jobs require physical presence and tangible objects. But experts worry that once the last baby boomers retire, their technical expertise will go with them. Perhaps they can leave behind a legacy of training simulations.  Inkpen sees DIY opportunities. Say your fridge breaks. Instead of calling a repair person, you boot up an AR tutorial on glasses, a tablet, or a projection that overlays digital instructions atop the appliance. Follmer wonders if haptic sensors woven into gloves or clothing would let people training for highly specialized jobs\u2014like surgery\u2014literally feel the hand motions of experienced professionals. For Poupyrev, the implications are much bigger. One way to think about AI is \u201cas a storage medium,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a preservation of human knowledge.\u201d A large language model like ChatGPT is basically a compendium of all the text information people have put online. Next, if we feed models not only text but real-world sensor data that describes motion and behavior, \u201cit becomes a very compressed presentation not of just knowledge, but also of how people do things.\u201d AI can capture how to dance, or fix a car, or play ice hockey\u2014all the skills you cannot learn from words alone\u2014and preserve this knowledge for the future. 2099Age 75 By the time you retire, families may be smaller, with more older people living solo.\u00a0 Well, sort of. Chaiwoo Lee, a research scientist at the MIT AgeLab, thinks that in 75 years, your home will be a kind of roommate\u2014\u201csomeone who cohabitates that space with you,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reacts to your feelings, maybe understands you.\u201d\u00a0 Related StoryI just watched Biggie Smalls perform \u2018live\u2019 in the metaverseAn avatar of the singer, who died in 1997, performed with live rappers on Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds.",
    "By now, a home\u2019s AI could be so good at deciphering body language that if you\u2019re spending a lot of time on the couch, or seem rushed or irritated, it could try to lighten your mood. \u201cIf it\u2019s a conversational agent, it can talk to you,\u201d says Lee. Or it might suggest calling a loved one. \u201cMaybe it changes the ambiance of the home to be more pleasant.\u201d The home is also collecting your health data, because it\u2019s where you eat, shower, and use the bathroom. Passive data collection has advantages over wearable sensors: You don\u2019t have to remember to put anything on. It doesn\u2019t carry the stigma of sickness or frailty. And in general, Lee says, people don\u2019t start wearing health trackers until they are ill, so they don\u2019t have a comparative baseline. Perhaps it\u2019s better to let the toilet or the mirror do the tracking continuously.\u00a0 Green says interactive homes could help people with mobility and cognitive challenges live independently for longer. Robotic furnishings could help with lifting, fetching, or cleaning. By this time, they might be sophisticated enough to offer support when you need it and back off when you don\u2019t. \u00a0 Kao, of course, imagines the robotics embedded in fabric: garments that stiffen around the waist to help you stand, a glove that reinforces your grip.  DAVID BISKUP   If getting from point A to point B is becoming difficult, maybe you can travel without going anywhere. Green, who favors a blank-slate room, wonders if you\u2019ll have a brain-machine interface that lets you change your surroundings at will. You think about, say, a jungle, and the wallpaper display morphs. The robotic furniture adjusts its topography. \u201cWe want to be able to sit on the boulder or lie down on the hammock,\u201d he says. Anne Marie Piper, an associate professor of informatics at UC Irvine who studies older adults, imagines something similar\u2014minus the brain chip\u2014in the context of a care home, where spaces could change to evoke special memories, like your honeymoon in Paris. \u201cWhat if the space transforms into a caf\u00e9 for you that has the smells and the music and the ambience, and that is just a really calming place for you to go?\u201d she asks.\u00a0 Gerber is all for virtual travel: It\u2019s cheaper, faster, and better for the environment than the real thing. But she thinks that for a truly immersive Parisian experience, we\u2019ll need engineers to invent \u2026 well, remote bread. Something that lets you chew on a boring-yet-nutritious source of calories while stimulating your senses so you get the crunch, scent, and taste of the perfect baguette. 2149Age 125 We hope that your final years will not be lonely or painful.\u00a0 Faraway loved ones can visit by digital double, or send love through smart textiles: Piper imagines a scarf that glows or warms when someone is thinking of you, Kao an on-skin device that simulates the touch of their hand. If you are very ill, you can escape into a soothing virtual world. Judith Amores, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, is working on VR that responds to physiological signals. Today, she immerses hospital patients in an underwater world of jellyfish that pulse at half of an average person\u2019s heart rate for a calming effect. In the future, she imagines, VR will detect anxiety without requiring a user to wear sensors\u2014maybe by smell.  \u201cIt is a little cool to think of cemeteries in the future that are literally haunted by motion-activated holograms.\u201d Tim Recuber, sociologist, Smith College You might be pondering virtual immortality. Tim Recuber, a sociologist at Smith College and author of The Digital Departed, notes that today people create memorial websites and chatbots, or sign up for post-mortem messaging services. These offer some end-of-life comfort, but they can\u2019t preserve your memory indefinitely. Companies go bust. Websites break. People move on; that\u2019s how mourning works. What about uploading your consciousness to the cloud? The idea has a fervent fan base, says Recuber. People hope to resurrect themselves into human or robotic bodies, or spend eternity as part of a hive mind or \u201ca beam of laser light that can travel the cosmos.\u201d But he\u2019s skeptical that it\u2019ll work, especially within 125 years. Plus, what if being a ghost in the machine is dreadful? \u201cEmbodiment is, as far as we know, a pretty key component to existence. And it might be pretty upsetting to actually be a full version of yourself in a computer,\u201d he says.\u00a0  DAVID BISKUP   There is perhaps one last thing to try. It\u2019s another AI. You curate this one yourself, using a lifetime of digital ephemera: your videos, texts, social media posts. It\u2019s a hologram, and it hangs out with your loved ones to comfort them when you\u2019re gone. Perhaps it even serves as your burial marker. \u201cIt is a little cool to think of cemeteries in the future that are literally haunted by motion-activated holograms,\u201d Recuber says. It won\u2019t exist forever. Nothing does. But by now, maybe the agent is no longer your friend. Maybe, at last, it is you. Baby, we have caveats. We imagine a world that has overcome the worst threats of our time: a creeping climate disaster; a deepening digital divide; our persistent flirtation with nuclear war; the possibility that a pandemic will kill us quickly, that overly convenient lifestyles will kill us slowly, or that intelligent machines will turn out to be too smart.\u00a0 We hope that democracy survives and these technologies will be the opt-in gadgetry of a thriving society, not the surveillance tools of dystopia. If you have a digital twin, we hope it\u2019s not a deepfake.\u00a0 You might see these sketches from 2024 as a blithe promise, a warning, or a fever dream. The important thing is: Our present is just the starting point for infinite futures.\u00a0 What happens next, kid, depends on you.\u00a0  Kara Platoni is a science reporter and editor in Oakland, California. hide"
