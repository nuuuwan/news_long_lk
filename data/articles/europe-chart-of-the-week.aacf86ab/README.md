Europe chart of the week: US-Russia talks begin

On February 18th US and Russian negotiating teams met in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. Neither Ukrainian nor European representatives were invited, prompting alarm among EU leaders. The two sides agreed to restore full staffing levels at their respective embassies and to appoint negotiating teams to discuss ending the Ukraine war. Donald Trump, the US president, has said that he may soon meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, although no date has yet been finalised. These first steps are consistent with our core scenario, which forecasts a weak deal being struck in 2025. However, we believe that there is a long way to go before a meaningful deal is agreed by all parties, including Ukraine and Europe, whose agreement will be necessary for any final deal.

Proposals for troops from NATO countries on the ground in Ukraine will continue to meet strong resistance from the Russian side in future negotiations. France and the UK have proposed a small air-power-backed peacekeeping “reassurance force” stationed in Ukraine after the war, but Russia has consistently made it clear that NATO troops on the ground is a red line. Russia has also called on NATO to rescind its open-ended offer for Ukraine to eventually join the alliance, a longstanding objection of the Kremlin. These positions are aligned with Russia’s maximalist war aims and the Kremlin view that closer Ukrainian relations with NATO were part of the root causes of the current war.

Bilateral talks with Russia have caused unease in Ukraine, which fears that an unfavourable deal will be imposed upon it. Members of the Trump administration have emphasised that the US is conducting shuttle diplomacy and negotiating with the two sides in parallel, and that allies are being consulted. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has stressed that any deal must be acceptable to all parties, including Europe and Ukraine. Mr Trump, however, has escalated attacks on his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodomyr Zelenskyi, calling him a “dictator”. This raises concerns that he is seeking to push Ukraine into elections, in the hope that this will produce a more malleable leader. Ukraine cannot hold elections while martial law remains in place, although discussions have been ongoing in the country for some time about the path to a post-war vote.

Russia has so far made very few concessions, and probably believes that it has a strong hand. A theoretical concession to Ukraine’s right to pursue EU membership made during a Kremlin press conference this week is presumably based on the knowledge that Ukraine faces substantial hurdles to EU accession, including pushback from farming lobby groups and the objection of several EU member state governments. We would expect Russia to revisit its objections if EU membership for Ukraine appeared imminent.

We believe that no deal is likely to be finalised until the second half of 2025. Mr Trump has set an Easter (April 20th) deadline for a deal, and reaching a ceasefire by then may be possible, but securing a final agreement is unlikely on this timescale. We expect that the final deal will be fairly weak, with insufficient peacekeeping troops on the ground to guarantee Ukraine’s security and Russia achieving the majority of its war goals, including keeping almost all of the territory seized and receiving assurances that Ukraine will not join NATO. However, the situation remains extremely fluid at this point, and multiple outcomes remain possible, including a failure of the peace process.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU’s Country Analysis service.
