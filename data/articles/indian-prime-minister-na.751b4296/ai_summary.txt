Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a third term in power on 4 June, despite his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning fewer than expected seats in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 291 seats, 32 short of the required 272 needed for a majority, while the Congress-led INDIA bloc won 234 seats, of which 99 were claimed by Congress. Mr. Modi praised the Election Commission (EC) for overseeing the world's largest vote, thanked female voters for their part in his victory, and promised to work towards the development of the nation. The results mark a return to coalition rule in India, something that has been absent for the past decade.
