    "Forests are the second-largest carbon sink on the planet, after the oceans. To understand exactly how much carbon they trap, the European Space Agency and Airbus have built a satellite called Biomass that will use a long-prohibited band of the radio spectrum to see below the treetops around the world. It will lift off from French Guiana toward the end of April and will boast the largest space-based radar in history, though it will soon be tied in orbit by the US-India NISAR imaging satellite, due to launch later this year. Roughly half of a tree\u2019s dry mass is made of carbon, so getting a good measure of how much a forest weighs can tell you how much carbon dioxide it\u2019s taken from the atmosphere. But scientists have no way of measuring that mass directly.\u00a0  \u201cTo measure biomass, you need to cut the tree down and weigh it, which is why we use indirect measuring systems,\u201d says Klaus Scipal, manager of the Biomass mission.\u00a0 Related StoryShould we be moving data centers to space?Building such facilities off Earth could have a lot of benefits. Early projects are underway.",
    "These indirect systems rely on a combination of field sampling\u2014foresters roaming among the trees to measure their height and diameter\u2014and remote sensing technologies like lidar scanners, which can be flown over the forests on airplanes or drones and used to measure treetop height along lines of flight. This approach has worked well in North America and Europe, which have well-established forest management systems in place. \u201cPeople know every tree there, take lots of measurements,\u201d Scipal says.",
    "But most of the world\u2019s trees are in less-mapped places, like the Amazon jungle, where less than 20% of the forest has been studied in depth on the ground. To get a sense of the biomass in those remote, mostly inaccessible areas, space-based forest sensing is the only feasible option. The problem is, the satellites we currently have in orbit are not equipped for monitoring trees.\u00a0 Tropical forests seen from space look like green plush carpets, because all we can see are the treetops; from imagery like this, we can\u2019t tell how high or thick the trees are. Radars we have on satellites like Sentinel 1 use short radio wavelengths like those in the C band, which fall between 3.9 and 7.5 centimeters. These bounce off the leaves and smaller branches and can\u2019t penetrate the forest all the way to the ground.",
    "This is why for the Biomass mission ESA went with P-band radar. P-band radio waves, which are about 10 times longer in wavelength, can see bigger branches and the trunks of trees, where most of their mass is stored. But fitting a P-band radar system on a satellite isn\u2019t easy. The first problem is the size.\u00a0 \u201cRadar systems scale with wavelengths\u2014the longer the wavelength, the bigger your antennas need to be. You need bigger structures,\u201d says Scipal. To enable it to carry the P-band radar, Airbus engineers had to make the Biomass satellite two meters wide, two meters thick, and four meters tall. The antenna for the radar is 12 meters in diameter. It sits on a long, multi-joint boom, and Airbus engineers had to fold it like a giant umbrella to fit it into the Vega C rocket that will lift it into orbit. The unfolding procedure alone is going to take several days once the satellite gets to space.\u00a0 Sheer size, though, is just one reason we have generally avoided sending P-band radars to space. Operating such radar systems in space is banned by International Telecommunication Union regulations, and for a good reason: interference.\u00a0  Workers roll the BIOMASS satellite out into a cleanroom to be inspected before the launchESA-CNES-ARIANESPACE/OPTIQUE VID\u00e9O DU CSG\u2013S. MARTIN   \u201cThe primary frequency allocation in P band is for huge SOTR [single-object-tracking radars] Americans use to detect incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles. That was, of course, a problem for us,\u201d Scipal says. To get an exemption from the ban on space-based P-band radars, ESA had to agree to several limitations, the most painful of which was turning the Biomass radar off over North America and Europe to avoid interfering with SOTR coverage.  \u201cThis was a pity. It\u2019s a European mission, so we wanted to do observations in Europe,\u201d Scipal says. The rest of the world, though, is fair game. The Biomass mission is scheduled to last five years. Calibration of the radar and other systems is going to take the first five months. After that, Biomass will enter its tomography phase, gathering data to create detailed biomass maps of the forests in India, Australia, Siberia, South America, Africa\u2014everywhere but North America and Europe. \u201cTomography will work like a CT scan in a hospital. We will take images of each area from various different positions and create the 3D map of the forests,\u201d Scipal says.\u00a0 Getting full, global coverage is expected to take 18 months. Then, for the rest of the mission, Biomass will switch to a different measurement method, capturing one full global map every nine months to measure how the condition of our forests changes over time.\u00a0 \u201cThe scientific goal here is to really understand the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. The main interest is the tropics because it\u2019s the densest forest which is under the biggest threat of deforestation and the one we know the least about,\u201d Scipal says.",
    "Biomass is going to provide hectare-scale-resolution 3D maps of those tropical forests, including everything from the tree heights to ground topography\u2014something we\u2019ve never had before. But there are limits to what it can do.\u00a0 \u201cOne drawback is that we won\u2019t get insights into seasonal deviations in forest throughout the year because of the time it takes for Biomass to do global coverage,\u201d says Irena Hajnsek, a professor of Earth observation at ETH Zurich, who is not involved in the Biomass mission. And Biomass is still going to leave some of our questions about carbon sinks unanswered. \u201cIn all our estimations of climate change, we know how much carbon is in the atmosphere, but we do not know so much about how much carbon is stored on land,\u201d says Hajnsek. Biomass will have its limits, she says, since significant amounts of carbon are trapped in the soil in permafrost areas, which the mission won\u2019t be able to measure.  \u201cBut we\u2019re going to learn how much carbon is stored in the forests and also how much of it is getting released due to disturbances like deforestation or fires,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is going to be a huge contribution.\u201d hide"
