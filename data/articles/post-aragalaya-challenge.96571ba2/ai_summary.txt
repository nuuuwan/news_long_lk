1. 📅 The 2022 Aragalaya in Sri Lanka opened a window for political change and unveiled the need for a new governance system. 

2. ⚖️ Prior to Aragalaya, the Tamil and Muslim minorities had been victims of a political culture controlled by the ideology of Sinhala-Buddhist Majoritarianism (SBM).

3. 🕊️ To challenge this culture, Tamil politicians advocated for federalism, which ultimately led to a bloody conflict when their demands were not met.

4. 📊 Muslims, identified as the business community, used their acumen to build alliances with whichever government was in power, often at the expense of the Tamil minority.

5. 😤 However, the rise of a Muslim political party in 1988 and the spread of Islamic puritanism led to heightened anti-Muslim sentiment.

6. 💸 Amid these dynamics, SBM's appeal began to wane when economic conditions started to deteriorate due to reckless borrowing and spending by the government.

7. 🔍 The SBM government's economic mismanagement, coupled with the COVID pandemic, eventually drove the country into bankruptcy, prompting the Aragalaya in 2022.

8. 🔄 The Aragalaya, a form of youth-led revolt, demanded a "system change" aiming for democratic and economic justice for all in Sri Lanka.

9. 🌅 The event highlighted the need for a new model of governance, signaling an end to SBM as a national ideology. 

10. ☑️ Now, minorities must ally with a new generation of politicians to shape a united Sri Lanka, focusing on meritocracy rather than ethnicity and religion for positions and rewards.
