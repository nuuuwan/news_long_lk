    "A number of the executive orders and announcements coming from the White House since Donald Trump returned to office have painted an ambitious vision for America\u2019s AI future\u2014crushing competition with China, abolishing \u201cwoke\u201d AI models that suppress conservative speech, jump-starting power-hungry AI data centers. But the details have been sparse.\u00a0 The White House\u2019s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won\u2019t come as a surprise, and you\u2019ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass \u201cburdensome AI regulations\u201d; and contract only with AI companies whose models are \u201cfree from top-down ideological bias.\u201d  But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn\u2019t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration\u2019s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.\u00a0 Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission",
    "When Americans get scammed, they\u2019re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.\u00a0 The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of \u201conerous\u201d regulation that it claims is hampering AI\u2019s development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC\u2019s actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it\u2019s just the latest in the Trump administration\u2019s escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story.",
    "The White House is very optimistic about AI for science The opening to the AI Action Plan describes a future where AI is doing everything from discovering new materials and drugs to \u201cunraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable\u201d to making breakthroughs in science and math.\u00a0 That type of unbounded optimism about AI for scientific discovery echoes what tech companies are promising. Some of that optimism is grounded in reality: AI\u2019s role in predicting protein structures has indeed led to material scientific wins (and just last week, Google DeepMind released a new AI meant to help interpret ancient Latin engravings). But the idea that large language models\u2014essentially very good text prediction machines\u2014will act as scientists in their own right has less merit so far.\u00a0 Still, the plan shows that the Trump administration wants to award money to labs trying to make it a reality, even as it has worked to slash the funding the National Science Foundation makes available to human scientists, some of whom are now struggling to complete their research.\u00a0  And some of the steps the plan proposes are likely to be welcomed by researchers, like funding to build AI systems that are more transparent and interpretable.

    "The White House\u2019s messaging on deepfakes is confused Compared with President Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI, the new action plan is mostly devoid of anything related to making AI safer.\u00a0 However, there\u2019s a notable exception: a section in the plan that takes on the harms posed by deepfakes. In May, Trump signed legislation to protect people from nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, a growing concern for celebrities and everyday people alike as generative video gets more advanced and cheaper to use. The law had bipartisan support.",
    "Now, the White House says it\u2019s concerned about the issues deepfakes could pose for the legal system. For example, it says, \u201cfake evidence could be used to attempt to deny justice to both plaintiffs and defendants.\u201d It calls for new standards for deepfake detection and asks the Department of Justice to create rules around it. Legal experts I\u2019ve spoken with are more concerned with a different problem: Lawyers are adopting AI models that make errors such as citing cases that don\u2019t exist, which judges may not catch. This is not addressed in the action plan.\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth noting that just days before releasing a plan that targets \u201cmalicious deepfakes,\u201d President Trump shared a fake AI-generated video of former president Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office. Overall, the AI Action Plan affirms what President Trump and those in his orbit have long signaled: It\u2019s the defining social and political weapon of our time. They believe that AI, if harnessed correctly, can help them win everything from culture wars to geopolitical conflicts. The right AI, they argue, will help defeat China. Government pressure on leading companies can force them to purge \u201cwoke\u201d ideology from their models.\u00a0 The plan includes crowd-pleasers\u2014like cracking down on deepfakes\u2014but overall, it reflects how tech giants have cozied up to the Trump administration. The fact that it contains almost no provisions challenging their power shows how their investment in this relationship is paying off.
