This article focuses on the political difficulties facing the Sri Lankan Muslim community and the role of "IS ideology." The writer warns his co-religionists to be careful, as they could become targets for this toxic brand of thought, most commonly spread in the Middle East. He also addresses the current wave of Hindutva-based ethno-nationalism in India and a similar Sinhala-Buddhist-oriented nationalism that is present in Sri Lanka. The author indicates these movements are harmful and might make "IS ideology" appear as a counterweight to them. He emphasizes that the Sri Lankan Muslims and government officials need to prevent this ideology from propagating. 

The writer also warns against chasing "pink elephants"â€”or false problems, and emphasizes the importance of objective, prejudice-free analysis. Finally, he urges his community to keep their guard up, for the rest of society to refrain from pushing Islamophobic narratives, and for his former colleagues to stop focusing on misleading problems.
