The Bharathipuram checkpoint incident refers to the notorious killing of eight Tamil civilians in Potkeni village, Sri Lanka, in 1998, during the three-decade conflict involving the Sri Lankan armed forces, police, and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Although initially rare, this case saw some judicial accountability as thirteen policemen and home guards were eventually arrested, leading to indictments for unlawful assembly and abduction with intent to murder. However, charges were withdrawn against some, and the case proceeded against seven accused individuals.

Witness testimonies largely supported the prosecution, with many recounting the abduction and subsequent murders near the Bharathipuram checkpoint, despite contradictions and evasions from some defense witnesses. Ultimately, five police officers were convicted of being part of an unlawful assembly with intent to murder but acquitted of direct murder charges due to insufficient evidence. The court noted the involvement of senior police officers and their failure to protect the civilians, indirectly suggesting an intentional disregard for their lives.

Though only one of the 37 charges resulted in conviction and justice came 26 years after the incident, this judgment offers a glimmer of hope that accountability for similar wartime atrocities may still be achievable, highlighting systemic issues in prosecuting military and police personnel accused of crimes against Tamil civilians.
