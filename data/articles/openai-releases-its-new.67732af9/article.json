    "On Thursday, Microsoft announced that it\u2019s rolling OpenAI's reasoning model o1 out to its Copilot users, and now OpenAI is releasing a new reasoning model, o3-mini, to people who use the free version of ChatGPT. This will mark the first time that the vast majority of people will have access to one of OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, which were formerly restricted to its paid Pro and Plus bundles. Related StoryWhy OpenAI\u2019s new model is such a big dealThe bulk of LLM progress until now has been language-driven. This new model enters the realm of complex reasoning, with implications for physics, coding, and more.",
    "Reasoning models use a \u201cchain of thought\u201d technique to generate responses, essentially working through a problem presented to the model step by step. Using this method, the model can find mistakes in its process and correct them before giving an answer. This typically results in more thorough and accurate responses, but it also causes the models to pause before answering, sometimes leading to lengthy wait times. OpenAI claims that o3-mini responds 24% faster than o1-mini. These types of models are most effective at solving complex problems, so if you have any PhD-level math problems you\u2019re cracking away at, you can try them out. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve had issues with getting previous models to respond properly to your most advanced prompts, you may want to try out this new reasoning model on them. To try out o3-mini, simply select \u201cReason\u201d when you start a new prompt on ChatGPT.\u00a0 Although reasoning models possess new capabilities, they come at a cost. OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is 20 times more expensive to run than its equivalent non-reasoning model, GPT-4o mini. The company says its new model, o3-mini, costs 63% less than o1-mini per input token However, at $1.10 per million input tokens, it is still about seven times more expensive to run than GPT-4o mini.",
    "This new model is coming right after the DeepSeek release that shook the AI world less than two weeks ago. DeepSeek\u2019s new model performs just as well as top OpenAI models, but the Chinese company claims it cost roughly $6 million to train, as opposed to the estimated cost of over $100 million for training OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. (It\u2019s worth noting that a lot of people are interrogating this claim.)\u00a0 Additionally, DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model costs $0.55 per million input tokens, half the price of o3-mini, so OpenAI still has a way to go to bring down its costs. It\u2019s estimated that reasoning models also have much higher energy costs than other types, given the larger number of computations they require to produce an answer. This new wave of reasoning models present new safety challenges as well. OpenAI used a technique called deliberative alignment to train its o-series models, basically having them reference OpenAI\u2019s internal policies at each step of its reasoning to make sure they weren\u2019t ignoring any rules. But the company has found that o3-mini, like the o1 model, is significantly better than non-reasoning models at jailbreaking and \u201cchallenging safety evaluations\u201d\u2014essentially, it\u2019s much harder to control a reasoning model given its advanced capabilities. o3-mini is the first model to score as \u201cmedium risk\u201d on model autonomy, a rating given because it\u2019s better than previous models at specific coding tasks\u2014indicating \u201cgreater potential for self-improvement and AI research acceleration,\u201d according to OpenAI. That said, the model is still bad at real-world research. If it were better at that, it would be rated as high risk, and OpenAI would restrict the model\u2019s release. hide"
