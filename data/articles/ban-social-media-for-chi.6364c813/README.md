A very close relative of mine, Sharaz Mohamed, phoned me recently  to write to the newspapers  requesting  Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya who is also Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education Minister for Sri Lanka to follow in the footsteps of Australia  in banning children under 16 from using social media.

If the above proposal could be implemented the potential advantages for both children and society are enumerated below:

1. Mental health benefits: Children would be less exposed to harmful content such as cyber bullying, etc. Social media can become addictive, and limiting access at an early age might help avoid the development of unhealthy screen time habits.

2. Enhanced academic focus: Without the distraction of social media, students might focus more on their studies, which could result in better academic performance and the development of critical thinking and social skills.

3. Safety and privacy protection: Children would not be vulnerable to online predators.

4. Better social interaction: Students might engage more in face-to-face interactions, improving their social skills, empathy, and emotional intelligence.

5. Encouragement of physical activity: More time could be spent on physical activities, sports, or hobbies, contributing to better overall health.

6. Increased family engagement: Families may engage more with their children in offline activities, fostering stronger family bonds.

7. Improved development of real-world skills: Students might develop better problem-solving Skills, creativity, and a more realistic understanding of the world.

Hope the PM will consider banning social media for everyone under the age of 16 because of the above benefits.
