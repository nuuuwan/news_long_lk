  "title": "How Neurosymbolic AI Finds Growth That Others Cannot See",
  "ut": 1760027053.0,
  "body_paragraphs": [
    "What if artificial intelligence could do more than see anecdotal evidence of where business growth is and identify the actions to drive that growth?",
    "That\u2019s the promise of neurosymbolic AI.",
    "Neurosymbolic AI fuses the statistical power, pattern recognition, and adaptability of neural networks\u2014think large language models (LLMs)\u2014with the logical, rule-based structure of symbolic reasoning that can predict real outcomes while helping prevent the hallucinations generative AI (GenAI) may produce.",
    "Correlation isn\u2019t causation. Summer is, of course, prime ice cream season in California, and that\u2019s also when shark bites are most prevalent\u2014but enjoying your mint chip cone won\u2019t make it more likely you\u2019ll get bitten. Neurosymbolic AI sorts out the coincidence and lets you dig down into what\u2019s really causing those shark bites.",
    "Pattern recognition and rules, coupled with business knowledge, help companies identify workflows for new ways to make money. In fact, some analysts have recognized the merits of neurosymbolic AI for some time. While research continues, however, neurosymbolic AI is already delivering value, especially in workflows where structured facts, explainable logic, unstructured data, and natural language need to work together.",
    "The EY-Parthenon neurosymbolic AI team is working with clients to use the EY Growth Platforms\u2019 neurosymbolic AI platform to plot business scenarios at hyperspeed and find previously unseen paths for growth.",
    "For example, leaders at one global equipment manufacturer were attempting to quantify the impact of new tariffs on their business. Their exercise included an analysis of historical transaction data and market sentiment and an understanding of where the company had price elasticity.",
    "The analysis took the company four months. Using its proprietary data with our neurosymbolic AI platform, which can access over 100 million data sources, the company achieved the same result in one day.",
    "A Brief History of Tension",
    "\u201cNeuro\u201d (neural networks) and \u201csymbolic\u201d (symbolic reasoning) have battled for attention over the years. Symbolic, with applications like a chess-playing computer that could beat a human world champion, was in vogue from the 1960s through the 1990s. More recently, LLMs have attracted more of the business world\u2019s attention\u2014and investment\u2014due to the prevalence of GenAI.",
    "Today, businesses can turn this systemic conflict between neuro and symbolic into cooperation. Think of a basic online search for a dress to wear at a wedding. Typing in \u201cwhite wedding dress\u201d uses neural pattern recognition. Typing in \u201csize 10 white wedding dress\u201d adds in the symbolic rule to get a much more useful result.",
    "A side-by-side comparison highlights the advantages of neurosymbolic AI as a growth engine, with symbolic reasoning expanding on the benefits of GenAI by uncovering value in the market that may otherwise be invisible.",
    "Taking GenAI to the Next Level",
    "Neurosymbolic AI Across Industries",
    "How can the neurosymbolic advantage help businesses grow? By replacing intuition with reasoned, repeatable, data-backed strategy that can serve the needs of businesses, customers, and even regulators. Unlike GenAI, which some have likened to a \u201cblack box,\u201d neurosymbolic AI is completely traceable, which is essential in highly regulated industries such as insurance and health care.",
    "The retail market, with customers\u2019 growing desire for personalized recommendations, is a prime candidate for neurosymbolic AI. As an example, one large retailer was grappling with frequently changing consumer preferences, which outpaced the time it needed to introduce new products. The company lost out on sales because it relied on beliefs, without any analytical backing, that its products would sell.",
    "Neurosymbolic AI team members and the retailer developed a platform that identifies trends and expedites ideation and testing processes to accelerate product development. That\u2019s where business value is created\u2014knowing when to apply rules on top of neural inference.",
    "From Buzz to Backbone",
    "Companies can gain a competitive edge with neurosymbolic AI by using the technology\u2019s predictive power to enhance forecasting, pricing, and market expansion strategies. This approach accelerates decision making and scales new growth platforms, enabling organizations to rapidly identify and act on diverse opportunities more quickly.",
    "GenAI may have captured businesses\u2019 full attention, but it isn\u2019t made to handle all of their strategic growth needs. Neurosymbolic AI addresses what corporations need now: explainable, integrated, causal decision making at global scale.",
