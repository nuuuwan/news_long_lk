    "Working for a highly critical boss can feel like operating under a microscope. Every task, no matter how small, seems to invite scrutiny. Meetings sometimes feel like inquisitions and you spend your days hearing more about what\u2019s going wrong than what\u2019s going right.",
    "While some difficult managers can be challenging due to their mood swings, lack of clarity, or unpredictability, highly critical leaders create an atmosphere of consistent, pervasive negativity. This can cause you to walk on eggshells, fearful of making mistakes, and leave you second-guessing your decisions and interactions.",
    "For deep-thinking and feeling professionals who invest a lot of emotional energy into their work (those I call sensitive strivers), working for this type of leader can be particularly draining. Many internalize their manager\u2019s negative feedback as a sign that they are inept or incapable. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Often, someone\u2019s critical nature has more to do with their own insecurities, bad experiences that have made them overly cautious, or a need to maintain control.",
    "While understanding this is helpful, continuously trying to diagnose the complex motivations behind a manager\u2019s criticism can be a never-ending and ultimately unproductive task. Instead, it\u2019s much more beneficial to focus on how you can navigate working for this type of person in a way that makes your life less stressful.",
    "Managing up to a highly critical boss doesn\u2019t mean abandoning your own judgment or simply following their orders. Rather, it\u2019s about proactively taking control of your interactions and taking steps to reduce the emotional toll their behavior has on you.",
    "View feedback as engagement",
    "Feedback means your boss is paying attention to your work, not disinterested in your projects and performance \u2014 even if they have a frustrating way of showing it. When you see your manager\u2019s criticism as a sign that they\u2019re invested in your work, it becomes easier to extract valuable insights from their comments. Their delivery might not be ideal, but they care enough about your development to provide input. If your boss didn\u2019t care, they might not even bother taking the time to correct you or offer guidance.",
    "To embrace this shift in perspective, try separating tone from content. Do your best to mentally strip away the emotional charge from your manager\u2019s words. Imagine the feedback being delivered in a neutral tone. For instance, transform, \u201cThis report is totally unacceptable\u201d to \u201cThere are issues that need to be addressed.\u201d This helps you concentrate on the substance rather than the (unhelpful) style.",
    "Get ahead of their negativity",
    "Before your boss has a chance to correct you, proactively seek their input. For instance, on a task, you might say, \u201cI\u2019m planning to approach the project this way. Do you have any initial thoughts?\u201d Before you present something to your boss, explain, \u201cI know you care about highlighting metrics so I\u2019ve put special attention into creating a compelling visual dashboard.\u201d",
    "Likewise, rather than toiling away for days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 to craft the perfect deliverable, create a first draft and say, \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve put together so far. It\u2019s a bit rough around the edges, but I wanted to capture the core ideas and structure, so we can shape it into something outstanding.\u201d Your boss will be happy to have control, and you\u2019ll conserve your energy.",
    "Seeking input early can feel like extra effort, but it shows you understand what\u2019s important to your boss, which can help build trust and lessen the need for them to constantly critique your work moving forward, since they see that you take their expectations seriously.",
    "Some people naturally have a more pessimistic mindset, and unfortunately, your boss may be one of them. So you may need to nudge them to see possibilities and probe for what is working, because it\u2019s not their default to volunteer that. When on the receiving end of excessive criticism, try: \u201cI enjoy hearing how I can improve. It\u2019s also important that I know what\u2019s going well, so I can do more of that. Is there room for you to share your perspective on that?\u201d Or try, \u201cI understand your concern about the creative brief. I\u2019ll work on that. But I\u2019d also like your feedback on how the client meeting went. I thought it was successful and I want to make sure I continue in the right direction.\u201d",
    "Ask for specific examples and clarification as well. For example, when Jessica, an analyst at a financial firm, found herself on the receiving end of vague, unhelpful directives from her manager (\u201cThis needs to be better. Fix it.\u201d) she asked more questions (\u201cCan you show me which specific data points you believe are inaccurate?\u201d or \u201cCould you give me an example of the preferred formatting you\u2019d like to see?\u201d). This not only helped her hone in on issues her boss had, but also subtly encouraged her manager to move away from generalizations and towards more constructive and fair feedback.",
    "When corrected, acknowledge your boss\u2019s perspective (\u201cyes\u201d), then add your perspective or suggestion (\u201cand\u201d). It\u2019s a great way to assert your ideas while showing that you are taking their feedback into account. Azim, a marketing lead, tried this with the Chief Marketing Officer who often dismissed his ideas. The next time she criticized a campaign, Azim replied, \u201cYes, I understand that the timeline is tight, and I believe we can meet the deadlines if we adjust our resource allocation slightly.\u201d",
    "Remember, though, that not all feedback is equally valuable or actionable. You can\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 take action on every criticism. Develop a mental filter to determine what\u2019s most urgent, important, and relevant to respond to.",
    "When your boss gives you feedback that\u2019s constructive or even slightly less critical than usual, acknowledge it. A simple \u201cThanks for sharing! That helps me feel more motivated\u201d goes a long way. You reinforce the behavior you want to see more of. Your boss, consciously or unconsciously, may be more likely to continue giving you balanced and helpful feedback when they see it is appreciated and has a positive impact on your performance.",
    "Despite your best efforts, your boss may never change their behavior. Be prepared to find other allies within the organization who can provide the support and validation you need. Ultimately, you might need to consider making bigger changes to protect your mental and emotional well-being \u2014 and to seek out a work environment where you are truly valued.",
