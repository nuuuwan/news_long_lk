    "The massacre of fifteen Australian Jewish citizens and wounding several more from that community at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach on 14 December - a day marking the beginning of Jewish Hanukkah festival - by a father-son pair of Muslim gunmen has been portrayed by the Western media as an act of ISIS inspired Islamist terrorism unleashed against world Jewry.",
    "But whether that savagery was a spontaneous reaction by two angry Muslim men schooled in Islamist ideology to seek revenge against Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza or whether it is linked to Netanyahu\u2019s anger at the Australian Prime Minister\u2019s decision to campaign and vote at the UN for an independent Palestinian state and whether there was another hidden force that orchestrated the whole tragedy never caught the attention of Western media.",
    "The fact that Ahmad al-Ahmad the \u201chero\u201d who grabbed the gun from the father-killer was shot by someone at the scene raises questions that need answer and calls for an independent investigation of the entire tragedy. Why was this man shot? Was it because he had become a spoiler of an intended drama? If so, what was the plot of that drama?\u00a0 From whichever angle one wishes to look at the massacre one cannot dismiss its link with Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza.",
    "Firstly, Israel has a history of going to bed with Islamists to promote its own strategic and military agenda in the Middle East.",
    "For instance, in an interview to UK Sunday Times, Israel\u2019s former army commander Gadi Eisenkot admitted that Israel supplied arms to ISIS fighters to topple Syria\u2019s Asad regime. Likewise, Israel\u2019s former defence minister and Leader of the Opposition Avigdor Lieberman accused Netanyahu Government of supplying weapons to ISIS backed gangs to fight Hamas in Gaza.\u00a0 The notorious gang leader Yasser Abu Shabab who was killed by Hamas recently was found operating with weapons supplied by Israel. Even Hamas for that matter was originally an Israeli creation set up to counter the popularity of Mahmud Abbas\u2019 Palestine Authority.",
    "Therefore, it is logical to surmise that the Sydney killers too may have been hired by Netanyahu\u2019s Zionist cabal or Mossad to create that horror to teach a lesson or two to the Albanese Government. If so, why should the lives of innocent Jews be sacrificed to teach that lesson?\u00a0 The answer is not far to seek.",
    "In Israel\u2019s military strategy, killing a few of its own people is justified if it guaranteed ultimate victory against the enemy. According to Israel\u2019s Haaretz, when the war against Hamas began in October 2023 the Hanibal Protocol was invoked allowing IDF to kill its own members if they happened to be in danger of being captured by Hamas. This was to prevent those captives becoming bargaining chips in future negotiation with Hamas.\u00a0 Thus, one cannot discount the possibility that the Sydney massacre which consumed the lives of more than a dozen innocent Jews may have been a deliberate design to punish Albanese Government\u2019s recognition of a Palestinian state and to force that government to retract.",
    "Even if all these speculations are dismissed as irrelevant then at least that tragedy could be considered as a blessing in disguise for Netanyahu and his cabal to wet their anger over Australia.\u00a0 There are other countries too such as UK, France, Canda, South Africa and others who also support an independent Palestinian state, and what would be Netanyahu\u2019s response to them is anyone\u2019s guess.",
    "In a sense, the Sydney massacre may have opened a new chapter in The Hundred Years War on Palestine. In Australia, Netanyahu has already forced Albanese Government to take a tough stand against the growing pro-Palestine protest movement.\u00a0 The so-called \u201cHate Speech\u201d laws introduced by the Government and similar actions announced by the state Government of New South Wales have virtually branded any pro-Palestine speech, slogan or symbol as antisemitism.",
    "Under these laws, all expressions of anti-Israeli sentiments have been branded as antisemitism.\u00a0 In passing, it is interesting to note that the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, has been reported arguing that to blame Australia for spreading antisemitism was \u201cunjustified\u201d.",
    "Anti-Semitism was originally coined by the German agitator Wilhelm Marr in 1879 to designate the growing anti-Jewish campaigns in Central Europe.\u00a0 It was essentially meant to depict Christian hatred of Jews, \u201ckillers of Christ\u201d. It is therefore historically incorrect and politically pro-colonialist and even racist for Wester powers to label support for an independent Palestine as Anti-Semitism.",
    "Aren\u2019t Palestinian Arabs and their Jewish brethren both Semitic people? Aren\u2019t Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic languages, and aren\u2019t Judaism, Islam and Christianity have the same Patriarch, Abraham. What is happening in Gaza and in Occupied West Bank therefore is that one Semitic community is struggling to liberate itself from decades of apartheid oppression by another Semitic community. In that sense, it is an inter-Semitic war in which the minority Palestinians are trying to galvanise the sympathy and support of the wider humanity. To depict that support as Anti-Semitism is pure Zionist propaganda backed by Global North.",
    "It is worth noting that Israel\u2019s Knesset had recently approved a budget allocation of $ 740 million for Hasbara\u2019s propaganda war. It was an increase of almost $ 600 million more than last year\u2019s.\u00a0 With this huge resource to spend on propaganda and with Mossad\u2019s secret agenda news reporters who contradict Israel\u2019s version of events may be wantonly targeted and killed while massacres like the one in Sydney may be repeated in other countries also.",
    "Donald Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cceasefire\u201d of 10 October 2025 endorsed slavishly by eight Muslim leaders was no more than a rebranding exercise to permit Israel to continue what it was doing in Gaza since October 2023 while preventing Hamas to respond with violence. Since October, Israel is reported to have bombed more than 700 times killing nearly 400 Gazans so far. Neither Trump nor his Muslim puppets have lifted even a finger in protest. Netanyahu is now preparing to inaugurate the second phase of Trump\u2019s plan to reconstruct Gaza under the supervision of a so-called international peace keeping force with US boots on the ground.",
    "In the meantime, Qatar proposes to drill for oil and gas in Palestinian waters and sell it to finance Gaza\u2019s reconstruction. Wasn\u2019t that the original plan behind Trump\u2019s Abraham Accord? In short, Global North with support of Arab rulers have decided remove Palestine from the world map. Do Palestinians have any alternative but to globalise their resistance?"
