There has been speculation about a potential postponement of elections in Sri Lanka amidst growing social and economic disparities and poverty. The UNP Secretary has suggested the elections may be delayed, while most citizens are battling high costs of living and poverty. An example of economic hardship is illustrated with the story of a widow with four young children who is struggling to survive after her husband's death. Data from the Department of Census and Statistics shows the top 10% of the population shared 32.9% of total income in 2016, while the lowest 10% only shared 2.9%. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of people classified as poor increased by 4 million to 7 million. The article concludes by calling for politicians to present practical solutions to poverty and inequality, rather than focusing on political maneuvering such as postponing elections.
