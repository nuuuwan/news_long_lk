The main political problems remain unresolved 15 years after the end of a brutal civil war in Sri Lanka, which lasted 30 years. In particular, a southern Sinhalese political majority does not consider finding a political solution to national ethnic problems a pressing issue. The 13th Amendment, which fulfils the political aspirations of minority communities, has also not been implemented. This lack of action is seen as a significant barrier to economic progression. However, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa continues to have a significant impact on the country's political situation, despite his government's toppling in an uprising two years ago.
