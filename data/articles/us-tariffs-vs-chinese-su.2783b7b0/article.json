    "China is the only country that defied President Trump\u2019s tariff and successfully brought the US to the negotiation table",
    "China is the only country that did not yield to American tariff pressure: Beijing imposed a 125% tariff on US exports in response to Washington\u2019s 145% tariff on Chinese imports. At the 30 October\u00a0 Sino-American summit in South Korea, Trump was forced to say that \u201che would reduce the composite tariff rate to 47% from 57% in exchange for China\u2019s commitments on soy purchases,\u201d elevating China to the \u201cpeer rival\u201d of the United States to dominate the world",
    "Beijing has seemingly learned the art of deal-making with Washington when \u201cXi found common ground with Trump\u2019s MAGA agenda, which parallels the Communist Party\u2019s own ambitions of restoring China\u2019s past glory, known as the \u2018great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u2019\u201d At the summit, President Xi Jinping also told President Trump: \u201cI always believe that China\u2019s development should go hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
    "Like other soybean farmers in the American heartland, my friend could hardly sell his Soybean and other agricultural produce because China\u2014the largest buyer\u2014threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs after President Donald Trump initially announced duties on Chinese goods.In response to China, Trump invoked his \u201cauthority\u201d under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to address the \u201cnational emergency.\u201d When China boycotted American soybean imports, Minnesota farmers felt acute financial hardship that drove a wave of bankruptcies in the agricultural sector",
    "When I visited my hometown in Minnesota this summer, my dear high school friend, who is a highly successful farmer, took me on a tour of his vast agricultural lands of some 50,000 acres of \u201cGod-given blessings\u201d in the breadbasket of the American heartland.",

    "During his first term in 2017, however, President Trump led a \u201cChina revolution\u201d in the heartland\u2014using American soybeans to make the \u201cMiddle Kingdom great again.\u201d When his second administration announced \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April 2025, the well-prepared and assertive China blocked the punitive tariff measures in May\u2014eventually forcing the United States to return to the negotiating table.",

    "Learn to lead the world",
    "China is the only country that did not yield to American tariff pressure: Beijing imposed a 125% tariff on US exports in response to Washington\u2019s 145% tariff on Chinese imports.

    "China\u2019s targeted strategic retaliations and surgical \u201cpressure points\u201d on Trump\u2019s MAGA political base in the Midwest counties created the intended financial pain on soybean farmers. Indeed, China has learned from Trump\u2019s give-and-take \u201ctransactional\u201d approach, executing a successful tactical operation in the American heartland. This combined with China\u2019s strategic calculus on global policymaking for supremacy. Yet Xi cleverly handed Trump a temporary win-win card to satisfy his voting bloc in the Midwest by resuming soybean purchases.",
    "In the meantime, strategic Beijing has continued to heavily invest in soybean and other commodities in Argentina, Brazil, and elsewhere. In Washington, the president angered American soybean farmers and Republican senators by providing a $ 20 billion financial aid package to Argentina, whose soybean exports to China reduced buying from the United States.",
    "History tells us that tariffs as a weapon in trade, especially in an increasingly interconnected global marketplace, risk backfiring. They also stand antithetical to the constitutional legacy of the US tariff policy.",
    "The primacy of national interest",
    "The birth of the US republic resulted from the unpopular British tariffs that sparked widespread resistance in colonial America. These continuing protests culminated in the Boston Tea Party and ultimately the American Revolution\u2014giving birth to a progressive nation conceived by the European Enlightenment ideas of the founding fathers who were also inspired by the Chinese philosophy and culture.",
    "The new nation signalled a radical departure from the colonial powers in Europe when the first US trade ship\u2014the Empress of China\u2014sailed on George Washington\u2019s birthday, 22 February 1784, from New York Harbour to Canton (now Guangzhou) in China. It was the historic beginning of the official Sino-American trade relations, which created a thriving and mutually beneficial commercial civilisation.",
    "Henceforth, the nascent republic\u2014supported by Washington\u2019s Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and his arch-rival Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who disagreed on everything but trade with China\u2014imposed a high tariff policy to protect infant domestic manufacturing and to raise federal government revenue.",
    "Since the founding era, the tariff-seeking industries scandalously bribed Congress with backroom deals for preferential rates, corrupting the American trading system. It ultimately hurt American consumers and exporters. To prevent these, the protectionist tariff policy led to the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1913. It gave Congress\u2014not the President\u2014the power to collect taxes on incomes as an alternative revenue source for the federal government (tariffs are also a form of taxes paid directly to the federal government by importers, who then pass the cost via higher prices to consumers).",
    "Since the catastrophic Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, US tariff rates have been reduced through a series of trade agreements and legislative acts, fostering global trade and American prosperity. President Trump not only reversed America\u2019s tariff policy, but he also fundamentally shifted it by using tariffs as the central tool of US economic and foreign policy. Moreover, he paused the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, opening a dangerous path for the \u201cnew American hustle\u201d that the 16th Amendment was designed to prevent.",
    "America against America",
    "Besides all these far-reaching\u2014intended and unintended\u2014policy implications, my high school farmer friend in Minnesota would be delighted to receive agricultural subsidies to compensate him for his losses, as the USDA plans to pay out $ 12 billion for farmers impacted by tariff policies. However, some may feel that this resource transfer is helping one group of Americans in favour of another, creating a more divided nation. We may all remember what President Abraham Lincoln counselled: \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d",
    "As Chinese leaders continue to learn from history to lead the way, can we learn from our own American Experiment, rooted in the Enlightened Americanism, for the benefit of all Americans?",
    "As of now, US Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) co-sponsored a joint resolution to terminate the \u201cnational emergency\u201d declared by the Trump White House to impose tariffs. Eventually, however, the tariff showdown\u2014as a landmark decision to reshape America, China, and the world\u2014rests with the Supreme Court of the United States in coming weeks and months.",
