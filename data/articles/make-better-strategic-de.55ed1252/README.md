Many breakthrough products include multiple technologies that evolved very slowly — sometimes over decades. To avoid being surprised or overtaken by competitors, companies must systematically track the evolution of these “slow-cooking” technologies as they improve in performance and decrease in price. The window of opportunity that arrives when all the right technologies reach the point of maturity may be smaller than you think.

Self-driving automobiles may seem like a cutting-edge 21st-century technology — a challenge still facing obstacles before widespread adoption. But in fact, autonomous driving has been evolving in fits and starts for a full century. Its evolution can teach managers how to deal with innovations that depend on multiple slow-developing technologies that come together at different speeds and costs.
