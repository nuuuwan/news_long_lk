Central Bank's usung heroes

Within moments, a deafening explosion brought the ceiling down. Something stung my eye. I crouched instinctively, my chin hitting my knees. I could no longer see my colleagues by the window

On 31 January 2026, thirty years later, we are meeting at my home - not just as survivors but as women bound by resilience, gratitude and an unbreakable sisterhood

SRI Lanka had already endured a long series of bombings even before the Central Bank bomb attack. Fear was part of daily life. The victims of a bomb explosion were often identified by their clothing. I remember leaving home each morning, asking my mother to look carefully at what I was wearing, because rumours were rife that the Central Bank was a target.

We were known as ‘Neela’s girls’ - Malkanthi Wijeratne, Hemanjila Perera, Seetha Jayasinghe (Kanthi), Vanitha Leanage, Nandani Menike, Shiormi Anandagodage, and I.  The only male in the Company Secretarial division was Dharmaratne, the office clerk. We occupied a section of the 4th floor of Carson's Equity Two Building. The Division faced the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  The entire wall facing the Central Bank was a glass window, with blinds that we drew open during lunch breaks.  ‘Neela’s girls’ were primarily in their early twenties to mid-thirties.  We were a close-knit group, laughing at the silliest things despite heavy workloads.  We enjoyed our work.

A few weeks prior to that fateful day, a sales representative from Ceylinco LIPS Insurance visited the Secretarial Division to promote an insurance policy which he said was exclusively designed for ladies and included coverage for cosmetic and plastic surgery resulting from an accident – how we laughed and thought it ridiculous. We were in our 20s, who would want plastic surgery?

31 January 1996 was different

I was about to step out to hand over a cheque to a nearby building where the Mercantile Netball Association was housed, as Carsons was registering for the Mercantile Netball Tournament.

I was seated in my cubicle when I heard sounds like clappers. Curious, I was the first to go to the window.   From the window, I saw a lorry attempting to force its way into the Central Bank compound, ramming the heavy metal barrier. I saw a man lying on the road and another crawling under a parked vehicle, likely trying to shield himself. Instinctively, I said, “it’s a bomb.”

The others in the division rushed to the window, but Neela de Silva firmly told us that people were shooting and ordered us back to our seats. I returned to my cubicle, briefly wondering whether to take the elevator, but then where to? I froze. In a daze, I did the only thing I knew - I began reciting the Lord’s Prayer, just as my mother had taught me to do whenever I was afraid.

Gutted Central Bank building

Within moments, a deafening explosion brought the ceiling down. Something stung my eye. I crouched instinctively, my chin hitting my knees. I could no longer see my colleagues by the window.   I made my way to the staircase with many others from the other floors joining, I kept saying, “I cannot see.” A hand immediately held mine. I later learnt that Upali from the mailroom had guided me down the steps. I could not open my eyes and tasted blood in my mouth. My dress was stuck to me, soaked in blood.   I was numb to pain.  When I felt we were outside the building, I heard the familiar, calming voice of Mr. Mano Selvanathan, Director, Carsons Management Services, saying, “this way.” In that moment, despite the chaos, I felt safe.

I recall being rushed to the Accident Ward and later being transferred to the Eye Hospital, where surgery was performed. The doctor told me that glass splinters had damaged the nerves of my right eye and that I would not regain vision in it. When the bandages were removed from my eyes, and I realised I could still see with my left eye, I felt overwhelming relief.

The visiting doctor from Carsons, Dr Navaratnam, came the following day, and it was a moment of pure gratitude when I was told that all of ‘Neela’s girls’ had survived.  Neela de Silva sustained a serious head injury but eventually made a complete recovery. Seetha (Kanthi) had pins inserted in her arm, which were removed after three years.  Nandani’s face remained noticeably darker for several months after the bomb fire. Vanitha was three months pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy in June.  Malkanthi sustained a leg injury, and she held the fort in the Secretarial Division until ‘Neela’s girls’ re-grouped after a few weeks/months.   Shiromi and Hemanjila suffered from many cuts and bruises and had near-misses to the eyes.  Dharmaratne, who always minded his own business sitting at his desk, had not sustained any injury, and he was our hero, as he was the one who called for help and ensured all ‘Neela’s girls’ were safely taken to the hospitals.  Neela de Silva says that if not for Dharmaratne, she would not be among the living.

My father later recalled that, after seeing the damage to the Equity Two Building, his colleagues urged him to look for me. He had replied, “she will come home.”  It was only after a friend from HNB informed my family that I was injured that my father began searching – directed first to the mortuary, fearing the worst, before finally being sent to the Eye Hospital.  Most family members were directed to the mortuary first.

All ‘Neela’s girls’ were treated by Dr. Narendra Wijemanne, the plastic surgeon, who sadly passed away in March 2025.  He would reassure us that he had carefully sutured our wounds so the scars would not show. He removed glass splinters from my face and eye over several visits. He was never rushed, always kind, and always had comforting words to share.

I chose never to live with self-pity. Instead of asking “why me?” I asked, “why not me?”. Some said it was my Karma. I said it was my faith in the Lord that has been tested (1 Peter 1:7). My parents, Desmond and Violet Dharmarajah - may their souls RIP - were my greatest strength. They never treated me as lacking, nor did they give me special privilege. They showed me, every day, that I had enough and that God would carry me through all challenges.

By the grace of God, we all moved on to live full and rich lives. Today, Neela de Silva, Malkanthi Wijeratne, Seetha Jayasinghe, Vanitha Leanage and Dharmaratne, after years of dedicated service, embrace a happy retirement. Hemanjila Perera married and subsequently relocated to the United States. Similarly, Shiormi Anandagodage married, had two children, and moved to Australia.  Nandani Menike, a dedicated and loyal employee, continues her service at Carsons.   As for me, I married in 1999, was blessed with three children, and today I serve as the Group Company Secretary of the national carrier.  My vision impairment in one eye has never diminished my enthusiasm or hindered my advancement. I thank God for this.

On 31 January 2026, thirty years later, we are meeting at my home - not just as survivors but as women bound by resilience, gratitude and an unbreakable sisterhood.

To those taken from us on 31st January 1996, your lives were stolen, but your memory endures. Time cannot fade the love, sorrow, or gratitude we hold for you. May your souls rest in peace and rise in glory.
