    "A baby boy born over the weekend holds the new record for the \u201coldest baby.\u201d Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26, developed from an embryo that had been in storage for 30 and a half years. \u201cWe had a rough birth but we are both doing well now,\u201d says Lindsey Pierce, his mother.\u00a0\"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby!\"  Lindsey and her husband, Tim Pierce, who live in London, Ohio, \u201cadopted\u201d the embryo from a woman who had it created in 1994.\u00a0She says her family and church family think \u201cit\u2019s like something from a sci-fi movie.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe baby has a 30-year-old sister,\u201d she adds. Tim was a toddler when the embryos were first created.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty surreal,\u201d says Linda Archerd, 62, who donated the embryo. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even believe.\u201d Three little hopes The story starts back in the early 1990s. Archerd had been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to get pregnant for six years. She and her husband decided to try IVF, a fairly new technology at the time. \u201cPeople were [unfamiliar] with it,\u201d says Archerd. \u201cA lot of people were like, what are you doing?\u201d",
    "They did it anyway, and in May 1994, they managed to create four embryos. One of them was transferred to Linda\u2019s uterus. It resulted in a healthy baby girl. \u201cI was so blessed to have a baby,\u201d Archerd says. The remaining three embryos were cryopreserved and kept in a storage tank. That was 31 years ago. The healthy baby girl is now a 30-year-old woman who has her own 10-year-old daughter. But the other three embryos remained frozen in time. Archerd originally planned to use the embryos herself. \u201cI always wanted another baby desperately,\u201d she says. \u201cI called them my three little hopes.\u201d Her then husband felt differently, she says. Archerd went on to divorce him, but she won custody of the embryos and kept them in storage, still hopeful she might use them one day, perhaps with another partner. That meant paying annual storage fees, which increased over time and ended up costing Archerd around a thousand dollars a year, she says. To her, it was worth it. \u201cI always thought it was the right thing to do,\u201d she says.\u00a0  Things changed when she started going through menopause, she says. She considered her options. She didn\u2019t want to discard the embryos or donate them for research. And she didn\u2019t want to donate them to another family anonymously\u2014she wanted to meet the parents and any resulting babies. \u201cIt\u2019s my DNA; it came from me \u2026 and [it\u2019s] my daughter\u2019s sibling,\u201d she says.

    "Then she found out about embryo \u201cadoption.\u201d This is a type of embryo donation in which both donors and recipients have a say in whom they \u201cplace\u201d their embryos with or \u201cadopt\u201d them from. It is overseen by agencies\u2014usually explicitly religious ones\u2014that believe an embryo is morally equivalent to a born human. Archerd is Christian. There are several agencies that offer these adoption services in the US, but not all of them accept embryos that have been stored for a very long time. That\u2019s partly because those embryos will have been frozen and stored in unfamiliar, old-fashioned ways, and partly because old embryos are thought to be less likely to survive thawing and transfer to successfully develop into a baby. \u201cSo many places wouldn\u2019t even take my information,\u201d says Archerd. Then she came across the Snowflakes program run by the Nightlight Christian Adoptions agency. The agency was willing to accept her embryos, but it needed Archerd\u2019s medical records from the time the embryos had been created, as well as the embryos\u2019 lab records.",
    "So Archerd called the fertility doctor who had treated her decades before. \u201cI still remembered his phone number by heart,\u201d she says. That doctor, now in his 70s, is still practicing at a clinic in Oregon. He dug Archerd\u2019s records out from his basement, she says. \u201cSome of [them] were handwritten,\u201d she adds. Her embryos entered Nightlight\u2019s \u201cmatching pool\u201d in 2022. Making a match \u201cOur matching process is really driven by the preferences of the placing family,\u201d says Beth Button, executive director of the Snowflakes program. Archerd\u2019s preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to go out of the country,\u201d says Archerd. \u201cAnd being Christian is very important to me, because I am.\u201d It took a while to find a match. Most of the \u201cadopting parents\u201d signed up for the Snowflakes program were already registered at fertility clinics that wouldn\u2019t have accepted the embryos, says Button. \u201cI would say that over 90% of clinics in the US would not have accepted these embryos,\u201d she says.  Lindsey and Tim Pierce at Rejoice Fertility.COURTESY LINDSEY PIERCE   Archerd\u2019s embryos were assigned to the agency\u2019s Open Hearts program for embryos that are \u201chard to place,\u201d along with others that have been in storage for a long time or are otherwise thought to be less likely to result in a healthy birth.  Lindsey and Tim Pierce had also signed up for the Open Hearts program. The couple, aged 35 and 34, respectively, had been trying for a baby for seven years and had seen multiple doctors. Lindsey was researching child adoption when she came across the Snowflakes program.\u00a0 When the couple were considering their criteria for embryos they might receive, they decided that they\u2019d be open to any. \u201cWe checkmarked anything and everything,\u201d says Tim. That\u2019s how they ended up being matched with Archerd\u2019s embryos. \u201cWe thought it was wild,\u201d says Lindsey. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know they froze embryos that long ago.\u201d Lindsey and Tim had registered with Rejoice Fertility, an IVF clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee, run by John Gordon, a reproductive endocrinologist who prides himself on his efforts to reduce the number of embryos in storage. The huge numbers of embryos left in storage tanks was weighing on his conscience, he says, so around six years ago, he set up Rejoice Fertility with the aim of doing things differently.",
    "\u201cNow we\u2019re here in the belt buckle of the Bible Belt,\u201d says Gordon, who is Reformed Presbyterian. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mode of practice.\u201d IVF treatments performed at the clinic are designed to create as few excess embryos as possible. The clinic works with multiple embryo adoption agencies and will accept any embryo, no matter how long it has been in storage.  COURTESY LINDA ARCHERD   It was his clinic that treated the parents who previously held the record for the longest-stored embryo\u2014in 2022, Rachel and Philip Ridgeway had twins from embryos created more than 30 years earlier. \u201cThey\u2019re such a lovely couple,\u201d says Gordon. When we spoke, he was making plans to meet the family for breakfast. The twins are \u201cgrowing like weeds,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
    "\u201cWe have certain guiding principles, and they\u2019re coming from our faith,\u201d says Gordon, although he adds that he sees patients who hold alternative views. One of those principles is that \u201cevery embryo deserves a chance at life and that the only embryo that cannot result in a healthy baby is the embryo not given the opportunity to be transferred into a patient.\u201d That\u2019s why his team will endeavor to transfer any embryo they receive, no matter the age or conditions. That can be challenging, especially when the embryos have been frozen or stored in unusual or outdated ways. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for people who don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d says Sarah Atkinson, lab supervisor and head embryologist at Rejoice Fertility. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill someone\u2019s embryos if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Cumbersome and explosive In the early days of IVF, embryos earmarked for storage were slow-frozen. This technique involves gradually lowering the temperature of the embryos. But because slow freezing can cause harmful ice crystals to form, clinics switched in the 2000s to a technique called vitrification, in which the embryos are placed in thin plastic tubes called straws and lowered into tanks of liquid nitrogen. This rapidly freezes the embryos and converts them into a glass-like state.\u00a0 The embryos can later be thawed by removing them from the tanks and rapidly\u2014within two seconds\u2014plunging them into warm \u201cthaw media,\u201d says Atkinson. Thawing slow-frozen embryos is more complicated. And the exact thawing method required varies, depending on how the embryos were preserved and what they were stored in. Some of the devices need to be opened while they are inside the storage tank, which can involve using forceps, diamond-bladed knives, and other tools in the liquid nitrogen, says Atkinson. Sarah Atkinson, lab supervisor and head embryologist at Rejoice Fertility, directly injects sperm into two eggs to fertilize them.COURTESY OF SARAH ATKINSON AT REJOICE FERTILITY.  Recently, she was tasked with retrieving embryos that had been stored inside a glass vial. The vial was made from blown glass and had been heat-sealed with the embryo inside. Atkinson had to use her diamond-bladed knife to snap open the seal inside the nitrogen tank. It was fiddly work, and when the device snapped, a small shard of glass flew out and hit Atkinson\u2019s face. \u201cHit me on the cheek, cut my cheek, blood running down my face, and I\u2019m like, Oh shit,\u201d she says. Luckily, she had her safety goggles on. And the embryos survived, she adds. The two embryos that were transferred to Lindsey Pierce. Atkinson has a folder in her office with notes she\u2019s collected on various devices over the years. She flicks through it over a video call and points to the notes she made about the glass vial. \u201cMight explode; wear face shield and eye protection,\u201d she reads. A few pages later, she points to another embryo-storage device. \u201cYou have to thaw this one in your fingers,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d",
    "The record-breaking embryos had been slow-frozen and stored in a plastic vial, says Atkinson. Thawing them was a cumbersome process. But all three embryos survived it. The Pierces had to travel from their home in Ohio to the clinic in Tennessee five times over a two-week period. \u201cIt was like a five-hour drive,\u201d says Lindsey. One of the three embryos stopped growing. The other two were transferred to Lindsey\u2019s uterus on November 14, she says. And one developed into a fetus. Now that the baby has arrived, Archerd is keen to meet him. \u201cThe first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cI pulled out my baby book and compared them side by side, and there is no doubt that they are siblings.\u201d She doesn\u2019t yet have plans to meet the baby, but doing so would be \u201ca dream come true,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish that they didn\u2019t live so far away from me ... He is perfect!\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t go into it thinking we would break any records,\u201d says Lindsey. \u201cWe just wanted to have a baby.\u201d  hide"
