Preliminary Iran-US talks conclude positively

What’s happened?Iran and the US have conducted their highest-level meeting for several years, hosted and mediated by Oman, to discuss a framework for potential negotiations on an agreement for Iran to scale back its nuclear activities in return for relief from crippling US sanctions. Both parties described the discussions as constructive and agreed to convene again, on April 19th. We expect several more rounds of formal talks to take place over the next two months.Why does it matter?The meeting in Muscat, the Omani capital, on April 12th, involving delegations led by Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign affairs minister, and Steve Witkoff, the US’s special envoy to the Middle East (who reports directly to the US president, Donald Trump), was the first formal engagement between the two countries since 2022. Pressure to start talks has come from a number of fronts, including Mr Trump’s credible threats to bomb Iran, if it did not negotiate nuclear de-escalation within two months, and notice from the European signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the existing nuclear deal, from which Mr Trump withdrew the US in 2018 and which expires in October) that they would decide by early July whether to respond to Iran’s mounting stockpile of enriched uranium by “snapping back” associated international sanctions relief. At the same time, Iran desperately needs a deal to alleviate dire economic problems—its president, Masoud Pezeshkian, came to office in July 2024 on a pledge to seek such an agreement. Although the Iranian government remains publicly insistent that any talks will cover only the nuclear question, there are signs that it is directing proxies in Iraq and Lebanon to adopt more conciliatory stances towards the respective US-backed central authorities in order to appease the US government.That Iran described the talks in Oman as both constructive and respectful indicates that the US declined either to reprise Mr Trump’s military threats or, as other reports confirmed, to demand the complete dismantlement of its nuclear programme (often referred to as the “Libyan option”), which it would not accept. The next meeting, which is likely to be held in Europe but with Oman mediating again, is due to finalise a framework for actual negotiations. Given the improbability of a comprehensive deal being concluded within two to three months, there have been suggestions that the parties could aim for an interim agreement involving some nuclear dial-back in return for limited sanctions relief: the previous US administration, under Joe Biden, Mr Trump’s predecessor, implemented something similar with its informal “less for less” arrangement, which led to some nuclear dial-back before the deal was derailed by the outbreak of regional hostilities following Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023. While this would force Mr Trump to modify his “maximum pressure” approach, reversals within his signature international trade policy in recent weeks have signalled a willingness to exercise pragmatic flexibility. In a further sign of momentum, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director-general is due to visit Iran for talks this week.What next?We expect Iran and the US to begin formal negotiations shortly, and the apparent willingness by both parties to adopt a more compromising approach than implied by the leaders’ public rhetoric, suggests that some form of deal—involving limited nuclear de-escalation in return for partial sanctions relief—might be possible in 2025. Certainly, an apparent initial willingness to compartmentalise the nuclear issue is a positive. However, there are already disagreements about US proposals to transfer Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium to a third country, which, alongside several other areas of dispute and deep mutual distrust, suggests that reaching a comprehensive, long-term agreement will remain extremely challenging. We will wait for news of the nature and content of pending formal talks before reviewing our current scenario probabilities for Iran.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU’s Country Analysis service.
