The corporate centre of a conglomerate can add or detract value from the conglomerate. The best parent companies are those that add more value than any competitor that might own the same company, a phenomenon known as a parenting advantage. In the 1960s and 1970s, conglomerates were popular but they lost favour in the 1980s as investors preferred to diversify their portfolios by buying into individual businesses. Nowadays, the parent company must demonstrate it can make its businesses perform better together than if they were separate entities.

However, a conglomerate's corporate level strategy needs to be more than merely a combination of each subsidiary's strategy to avoid eroding value. The markets often assign a conglomerate discount to multi-unit businesses due to a number of factors, including past failures, diluted focus, complex governance structures, unclear capital structures and confusing accounting. Despite this, these discounts can be turned into a premium through value-creating parenting, for example, General Electric under Jack Welch.

The corporate centre of a conglomerate symbolises the corporate parent and is responsible for formulating corporate strategy, making decisions ranging from portfolio composition to acquisitions and divestments, deciding on capital structure, and creating group-wide codes of conduct. Costing aspects of the corporate centre should not burden businesses but actually support them.

The writer cites his experience at two large conglomerates, Anglo American Corporation and John Keells Holdings, where the corporate level strategy greatly enhanced the businesses. He concludes by reiterating that the corporate centre's effectiveness in adding value to the conglomerate must be real, not ostensible.
