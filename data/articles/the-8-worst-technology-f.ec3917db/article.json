    "They say you learn more from failure than success. If so, this is the story for you: MIT Technology Review\u2019s annual roll call of the biggest flops, flimflams, and fiascos in all domains of technology. Some of the foul-ups were funny, like the \"woke\u201d AI which got Google in trouble after it drew Black Nazis. Some caused lawsuits, like a computer error by CrowdStrike that left thousands of Delta passengers stranded. We also reaped failures among startups that raced to expand from 2020 to 2022, a period of ultra-low interest rates. But then the economic winds shifted. Money wasn\u2019t free anymore. The result? Bankruptcy and dissolution for companies whose ambitious technological projects, from vertical farms to carbon credits, hadn\u2019t yet turned a profit and might never do so.  Read on. Woke AI blunder  GOOGLE GEMINI VIA X.COM/END WOKENESS   People worry about bias creeping into AI. But what if you add bias on purpose? Thanks to Google, we know where that leads: Black Vikings and female popes.",
    "Google\u2019s Gemini AI image feature, launched last February, had been tuned to zealously showcase diversity, damn the history books. Ask Google for a picture of German soldiers from World War II, and it would create a Benetton ad in Wehrmacht uniforms.\u00a0 Critics pounced and Google beat an embarrassed retreat. It paused Gemini\u2019s ability to draw people and agreed its well-intentioned effort to be inclusive had \u201cmissed the mark.\u201d",
    "The free version of Gemini still won\u2019t create images of people. But paid versions will. When we asked for an image of 12 CEOs of public biotech companies, the software produced a photographic-quality image of middle-aged white men. Less than ideal. But closer to the truth.\u00a0 More: Is Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot woke by accident, or by design? (The Economist), Gemini image generation got it wrong. We'll do better. (Google)  Boeing Starliner  THE BOEING COMPANY VIA NASA   Boeing, we have a problem. And it\u2019s your long-delayed reusable spaceship, the Starliner, which stranded NASA astronauts Sunita \u201cSuni\u201d Williams and\u00a0 Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore on the International Space Station. The June mission was meant to be a quick eight-day round trip to test Starliner before it embarked on longer missions. But, plagued by helium leaks and thruster problems, it had to come back empty.\u00a0  Now Butch and Suni won\u2019t return to Earth until 2025, when a craft from Boeing competitor SpaceX is scheduled to bring them home.\u00a0 Credit Boeing and NASA with putting safety first. But this wasn\u2019t Boeing\u2019s only malfunction during 2024. The company began the year with a door blowing off one of its planes midflight, faced a worker strike, agreed to a major fine for misleading the government about the safety of its 737 Max airplane (which made our 2019 list of worst technologies), and saw its CEO step down in March. After the Starliner fiasco, Boeing fired the chief of its space and defense unit. \u201cAt this critical juncture, our priority is to restore the trust of our customers and meet the high standards they expect of us to enable their critical missions around the world,\u201d Boeing\u2019s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, said in a memo.

    "CrowdStrike outage  MITTR / ENVATO   The motto of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike is \u201cWe stop breaches.\u201d And it\u2019s true: No one can breach your computer if you can\u2019t turn it on. That\u2019s exactly what happened to many people on July 19, when thousands of Windows computers at airlines, TV stations, and hospitals started displaying the \u201cblue screen of death.\u201d\u00a0 The cause wasn\u2019t hackers or ransomware. Instead, those computers were stuck in a boot loop because of a bad update shipped by CrowdStrike itself. CEO George Kurtz jumped on X to say the \u201cissue\u201d had been identified as a \u201cdefect\u201d in a single computer file. So who is liable? CrowdStrike customer Delta Airlines, which canceled 7,000 flights, is suing for $500 million. It alleges that the security firm caused a \u201cglobal catastrophe\u201d when it took \u201cuncertified and untested shortcuts.\u201d\u00a0  CrowdStrike countersued. It says Delta\u2019s management is to blame for its troubles and that the airline is due little more than a refund.\u00a0 More: \u201cCrowdstrike is working with customers\u201d(George Kurtz), How to fix a Windows PC affected by the global outage (MIT Technology Review), Delta Sues CrowdStrike Over July Operations Meltdown (WSJ)  Vertical farms  MITTR / ENVATO   Grow lettuce in buildings using robots, hydroponics, and LED lights. That\u2019s what Bowery, a \u201cvertical farming\u201d startup, raised over $700 million to do. But in November, Bowery went bust, making it the biggest startup failure of the year, according to the business analytics firm CB Insights.\u00a0 Bowery claimed that vertical farms were \u201c100 times more productive\u201d per square foot than traditional farms, since racks of plants could be stacked 40 feet high. In reality, the company\u2019s lettuce was more expensive, and when a stubborn plant infection spread through its East Coast facilities, Bowery had trouble delivering the green stuff at any price.",

    "The deadly attack was diabolically clever. Israel set up shell companies that sold thousands of pagers packed with explosives to the Islamic faction, which was already worried that its phones were being spied on.\u00a0 A coup for Israel\u2019s spies.

(Middle East Eye)  23andMe  MITTR / ADOBE STOCK   The company that pioneered direct-to-consumer gene testing is sinking fast. Its stock price is going toward zero, and a plan to create valuable drugs is kaput after that team got pink slips this November. 23andMe always had a celebrity aura, bathing in good press. Now, though, the press is all bad. It\u2019s a troubled company in the grip of a controlling founder, Anne Wojcicki, after its independent directors resigned en masse this September. Customers are starting to worry about what\u2019s going to happen to their DNA data if 23andMe goes under. 23andMe says it created \u201cthe world\u2019s largest crowdsourced platform for genetic research.\u201d That\u2019s true. It just never figured out how to turn a profit.",

So why not pay to have some trees planted or buy a more efficient cookstove for someone in Central America? Then you could reach net-zero emissions and help save the planet. Neat idea, but good intentions aren't enough. This year the carbon marketplace Nori shut down, and so did Running Tide, a firm trying to sink carbon into the ocean. \u201cThe problem is the voluntary carbon market is voluntary,\u201d Running Tide\u2019s CEO wrote in a farewell post, citing a lack of demand. While companies like to blame low demand, it's not the only issue. Sketchy technology, questionable credits, and make-believe offsets have created a credibility problem in carbon markets. In October, US prosecutors charged two men in a $100 million scheme involving the sale of nonexistent emissions savings.\u00a0 More: The growing signs of trouble for global carbon markets (MIT Technology Review), Running Tide\u2019s ill-fated adventure in ocean carbon removal (Canary Media), Ex-carbon offsetting boss charged in New York with multimillion-dollar fraud (The Guardian)\u00a0 hide"
