Or that it\u2019s a bit like a recipe. But building an organism is much more complex than constructing a house or baking a cake.  This week I came across an idea for a new way to think about the genome\u2014one that borrows from the field of artificial intelligence. Two researchers are arguing that we should think about it as being more like a generative model, a form of AI that can generate new things. Related StoryWhat is AI?Everyone thinks they know but no one can agree. And that\u2019s a problem.",
    "You might be familiar with such AI tools\u2014they\u2019re the ones that can create text, images, or even films from various prompts. Do our genomes really work in the same way? It\u2019s a fascinating idea. Let\u2019s explore.",
    "When I was at school, I was taught that the genome is essentially a code for an organism. It contains the instructions needed to make the various proteins we need to build our cells and tissues and keep them working. It made sense to me to think of the human genome as being something like a program for a human being. But this metaphor falls apart once you start to poke at it, says Kevin Mitchell, a neurogeneticist at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, who has spent a lot of time thinking about how the genome works.",
    "A computer program is essentially a sequence of steps, each controlling a specific part of development. In human terms, this would be like having a set of instructions to start by building a brain, then a head, and then a neck, and so on. That\u2019s just not how things work. Another popular metaphor likens the genome to a blueprint for the body. But a blueprint is essentially a plan for what a structure should look like when it is fully built, with each part of the diagram representing a bit of the final product. Our genomes don\u2019t work this way either. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019ve got a gene for an elbow and a gene for an eyebrow. Multiple genes are involved in the development of multiple body parts. The functions of genes can overlap, and the same genes can work differently depending on when and where they are active. It\u2019s far more complicated than a blueprint. Related StoryGenerative AI is changing everything. But what\u2019s left when the hype is gone?No one knew how popular OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E would be in 2022, and no one knows where its rise will leave us.",
    "Then there\u2019s the recipe metaphor. In some ways, this is more accurate than the analogy of a blueprint or program. It might be helpful to think about our genes as a set of ingredients and instructions, and to bear in mind that the final product is also at the mercy of variations in the temperature of the oven or the type of baking dish used, for example. Identical twins are born with the same DNA, after all, but they are often quite different by the time they\u2019re adults.  But the recipe metaphor is too vague, says Mitchell. Instead, he and his colleague Nick Cheney at the University of Vermont are borrowing concepts from AI to capture what the genome does. Mitchell points to generative AI models like Midjourney and DALL-E, both of which can generate images from text prompts. These models work by capturing elements of existing images to create new ones. Say you write a prompt for an image of a horse. The models have been trained on a huge number of images of horses, and these images are essentially compressed to allow the models to capture certain elements of what you might call \u201chorsiness.\u201d The AI can then construct a new image that contains these elements. We can think about genetic data in a similar way. According to this model, we might consider evolution to be the training data. The genome is the compressed data\u2014the set of information that can be used to create the new organism. It contains the elements we need, but there\u2019s plenty of scope for variation. (There are lots more details about the various aspects of the model in the paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.) Mitchell thinks it\u2019s important to get our metaphors in order when we think about the genome. New technologies are allowing scientists to probe ever deeper into our genes and the roles they play. They can now study how all the genes are expressed in a single cell, for example, and how this varies across every cell in an embryo.",
    "\u201cWe need to have a conceptual framework that will allow us to make sense of that,\u201d says Mitchell. He hopes that the concept will aid the development of mathematical models that might help us better understand the intricate relationships between genes and the organisms they end up being part of\u2014in other words, exactly how components of our genome contribute to our development.  Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review\u2019s archive: Last year, researchers built a new human genome reference designed to capture the diversity among us. They called it the \u201cpangenome,\u201d as Antonio Regalado reported. Generative AI has taken the world by storm. Will Douglas Heaven explored six big questions that will determine the future of the technology. A Disney director tried to use AI to generate a soundtrack in the style of Hans Zimmer. It wasn\u2019t as good as the real thing, as Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 found. Melissa has also reported on how much energy it takes to create an image using generative AI. Turns out it\u2019s about the same as charging your phone.\u00a0 What is AI? No one can agree, as Will found in his recent deep dive on the topic.
