1️⃣ Hydropower, the largest source of renewable electricity, significantly impacts fish due to habitat disruption caused by dams. 🌊🐟
2️⃣ Some areas like the US, Canada, and Europe have protections to mitigate harm from hydropower facilities to ecosystems. 🌍🛡️
3️⃣ Older hydropower plants face strict environmental regulations, and many face potential closure or costly upgrades. 💸🏭
4️⃣ Natel Energy is pioneering new fish-safe turbine designs for hydropower plants. 👷‍♀️🔄
5️⃣ The company's turbine blades have a design that reduces the risk of fatal contact with fish. 🐠🔁
6️⃣ Studies show over 99% of eels survived passing through Natel's equipment in comparison to the 40% survival rate by traditional power plant turbines. 🧪🐍
7️⃣ By 2030, over 20% of hydropower units globally will be over 55 years old. 🚀⏰
8️⃣ In the US, nearly 17 gigawatts of hydropower facilities will require relicensing by 2035. ⚖️⚡
9️⃣ Natel's technology represents a less costly alternative to traditional environmental requirements. 💡🌿
🔟 The company is expanding its technology by installing several projects in Maine, Oregon, and Austria, and licensing its turbine designs to manufacturers. 🏗️🌐
