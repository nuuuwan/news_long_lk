The BRICS coalition (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has expanded, welcoming Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE on 1st January 2024. Its collective population is now about 3.5 billion people, with economies valued at over $28.5 trillion. BRICS encourages aspects such as non-interference, equality, and respect for sovereignty and fosters cooperation across sectors including trade, investment, technology and innovation. The coalition hopes to challenge the dominance of the US dollar in global trade and give emerging economies a greater voice and representation. Sri Lanka has expressed a desire to join the BRICS in 2024, hoping to reap benefits from duty-free trade, financial support, infrastructure development and geopolitical positioning. Nevertheless, BRICS faces scrutiny over internal disparities, conflicting interests and certain countries' human rights records.
