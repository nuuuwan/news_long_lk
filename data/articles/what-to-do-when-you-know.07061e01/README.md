There are instances when, as a newer professional, you might have more experience in certain areas than your manager. This could be a deeper understanding of the technologies you grew up, some innovations in your field, or even foundational leadership skills that you’d like to share. There are ways to communicate your knowledge with your superiors while maintaining humility and a collaborative mindset. The key is to be curious and collaborative — asking questions to better understand their perspectives and framing your insights as resources that will benefit the team.
