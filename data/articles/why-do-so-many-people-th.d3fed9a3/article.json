    "There is a shirt currently listed on eBay for $2,128.79. It was not designed by Versace or Dior, nor spun from the world\u2019s finest silk. In fact, a tag proudly declares, \u201c100% cotton made in Myanmar\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s a second tag, just below that one, that makes this blue button-down so expensive.\u00a0  \u201cI looked at it and I was like, Wow, this is cool,\u201d says Brooke Hermann, the 30-year-old Kentucky-based reseller who bought the top for $1 at a secondhand sale in 2024. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like any other Fruit of the Loom tag I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Quick question: Does the Fruit of the Loom logo feature a cornucopia?\u00a0  Many of us have been wearing the casualwear company\u2019s T-shirts and underpants for decades, and yet the question of whether there is a woven brown horn of plenty on the logo is surprisingly contentious. According to a 2022 poll by the research company YouGov, 55% of Americans believe the logo does include a cornucopia, 25% are unsure, and only 21% are confident that it doesn\u2019t, even though this last group is correct. According to a 2023 post from the company, the Fruit of the Loom logo does not include\u2014and, according to Snopes, has never included\u2014a horn of plenty. (MIT Technology Review could not reach Fruit of the Loom for comment.)    This story is part of MIT Technology Review\u2019s series \u201cThe New Conspiracy Age,\u201d on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.   Maybe you\u2019ve come across this fact before, via an internet meme that made you gasp, shrug, or scratch your head. There\u2019s a specific name for what\u2019s happening here: Those who believe the logo used to include the cornucopia are experiencing the \u201cMandela effect,\u201d or collective false memory, so called because a number of people misremember that Nelson Mandela died in prison. I helped popularize the phenomenon in a viral 2016 New Statesman article about a movie that doesn\u2019t actually exist, and in the time since it\u2019s become something of a household term; TV shows from Saturday Night Live to Black Mirror to The X-Files have explored the Mandela effect. But whether you remember the brown horn, incorrectly recall Darth Vader saying, \u201cLuke, I am your father,\u201d or believe that a popular children\u2019s book was spelled The Berenstein Bears, you\u2019ve probably moved on with your life. Google searches for \u201cMandela effect\u201d have plummeted from 2016 highs, and Hermann has had zero bids on the shirt she posted last year\u2014even though, at least to her eyes, it features a cornucopia on the tag. \u201cNo one\u2019s really offered anything, and no one\u2019s said anything about it,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich to me is kind of crazy.\u201d",

There are commonly more than 170,000 weekly visitors to a Mandela effect subreddit that sees over 1,000 comments on average every day. While a fair share of these commenters are skeptics, plenty more are dedicated believers who are not satisfied with the prevailing explanation that human memory is fallible and instead invest their time into bringing the truth\u2014whatever exactly it may be\u2014to light.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been a bit ostracized from my family ever since I started pushing this thing nine years ago,\u201d says a 51-year-old Massachusetts-based Fruit of the Loom truther who asked to go by the name AJ Booras. \u201cI\u2019m not inclined to simply let this phenomenon fall by the proverbial wayside, even if I\u2019m the last one standing.\u201d",
    "Some online believe in a fairly straightforward conspiracy: They want Fruit of the Loom to confess that it\u2019s \u201cgaslighting\u201d customers and used to have a cornucopia on its tags. Others speculate that the answer lies in quantum physics: If\u2014as the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said\u2014there\u2019s \u201cbetter than 50-50 odds\u201d that we\u2019re living in a simulation, then might there be some sort of glitch, lag, or failed software update that means some people see and remember the world differently from others? \u201cThe scientific community isn\u2019t really looking that hard at it\u2014and if they are, they\u2019re always framing it as a memory thing,\u201d says AJ. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard barrier to make any headway on.\u201d This is why, AJ says, he\u2019s become \u201caddicted\u201d to researching the phenomenon: \u201cIt\u2019s a personal quest for vindication.\u201d\u00a0 Will anyone ever believe these believers? There are two options for those who think the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia: accept that your memory is wrong, or think that the world is. What makes some people happy with the simple explanation and others determined to seek the more complicated one?\u00a0 \u201cThe bridge between perception and memory\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing quite as disconcerting as when memory and reality conflict. After all, what is reality\u2014or at least your reality\u2014if not your memory? This is why it can be so satisfying to find concrete evidence that you are irrefutably correct: Here\u2019s an old photo that proves Dad did come on the \u201909 trip to Florida and your sister is foolish and wrong.\u00a0  In the Mandela effect community, evidence implying that the world used to be different is called \u201cresidue.\u201d There is an abundant amount of residue suggesting that the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia.\u00a0 In the 2006 animated film The Ant Bully, a pair of parodical \u201cFruit of the Loin\u201d underwear is drawn with a cornucopia on the tag. A similar gag in a 2012 episode of South Park sees a fake clothing brand named \u201cCornucopia.\u201d In 1973, when the jazz flutist Frank Wess released an album called Flute of the Loom, the cover showed fruit pouring out a cornucopia-shaped flute. When allegedly tracked down by Redditors, the illustrator reportedly said the clothing logo had inspired the design: \u201cWhy the hell else would I have used a cornucopia?\u201d\u00a0 On top of that, numerous newspaper and magazine articles written from the 1970s to the early 2000s reference the horn of plenty, as does a short play first performed in 1968 and a novel, The Brothers K, published in 1992. New residue is still being discovered: In April 2025, a TikToker shared an old \u201990s trivia game in which clues about brands are listed on cards. The card for Fruit of the Loom includes the words \u201cunderwear,\u201d \u201capples and grapes,\u201d and \u201ccornucopia.\u201d\u00a0 How can all these people\u2014animators, illustrators, journalists, and writers\u2014have made the same mistake? When I reached out to the author of The Brothers K, David James Duncan, he was adamant that there was no mistake: \u201cMy inspiration was the Fruit of the Loom boxer shorts I owned at the time,\u201d he said via email. \u201cI changed nothing in describing the boxers, and yes, they did have a Fruit of the Loom cornucopia on the label in the back of the shorts.\u201d",
    "Conversely, when I spoke with Billy Cox, a journalist who referenced the cornucopia in a 1994 article in Florida Today, he was less confident. \u201cI have no idea what fueled my initial assumption about the cornucopia. Zero. Zilch-o. Nada,\u201d said Cox, also via email. But he\u2019s prepared to admit that he may have been careless in his reporting: \u201cEven if the internet had been available back then, I doubt I would\u2019ve double-checked the logo\u2019s history.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting thought: Most of the articles referencing the cornucopia are from a period\u2014the \u201970s through the \u201990s\u2014when journalists wouldn\u2019t have been able to quickly google the logo. But why would they all misremember it the exact same way?\u00a0 Wilma Bainbridge is an associate psychology professor at the University of Chicago who researches what she calls \u201cthe bridge between perception and memory\u201d; she got her PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT in 2016.\u00a0 Bainbridge herself first came across the Mandela effect on social media\u2014she was \u201cwowed\u201d when confronted with the true spelling of the Berenstain Bears in the famous American children\u2019s books. In 2022, she published a scientific study on visual Mandela effects and ultimately found that there is consistency in what people misremember. \u201cPeople\u2019s memories are surprisingly predictable,\u201d she says.\u00a0  ADOBE STOCK   WIKIMEDIA COMMONS   The husband-and-wife team of Stanley and Janice Berenstain wrote and illustrated the popular children\u2019s books. More than 300 titles bear the family name.  In one experiment in the study, she found that people who aren\u2019t very familiar with an image can share the same false memories as those who claim to be highly familiar. For example, some Mandela effect experiencers believe that the Monopoly man wore a monocle. In Bainbridge\u2019s study, even people who didn\u2019t know the character well sometimes drew the monocle when they were shown the Monopoly man and were later asked to draw him; this means the mistake was based on recall, not recognition, and could suggest that there\u2019s something intrinsic to certain images that encourages memory errors.\u00a0 Scientists have long demonstrated that human memory is inherently fallible. In 1996, psychologists asked people whether they had watched news footage of the 1992 Bijlmer plane crash in Amsterdam, and more than 60% of the participants said yes\u2014even though no recording of the crash exists. Other studies have shown that our memories can be corrupted by our peers and that false memories can be contagious. Arguably, the internet has caused memory contagion when it comes to the Mandela effect: Comparatively very few people googled \u201cFruit of the Loom cornucopia\u201d between 2004 and 2017, with searches growing more common after a Redditor pointed out what was believed to be the first piece of \u201cresidue\u201d in 2016 and (and again spiking dramatically when a TikTok video on the phenomenon was posted in 2023; it\u2019s since earned over 5 million views).\u00a0 \u201cSome people make things go viral because they want to believe it,\u201d says Don, a 61-year-old American who has been moderating the Mandela effect subreddit since 2017. (He asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy.) \u201cPeople want to be part of the experience.\u201d Still, Bainbridge\u2019s study didn\u2019t land on one definitive reason for the Mandela effect. \u201cI was surprised to find there was no singular explanation,\u201d she says.",
    "Using a method of monitoring cursor movement that\u2019s analogous to eye-tracking technology, the academic tested whether people made memory errors because they didn\u2019t pay attention to an image or looked at only certain parts of it. She found this wasn\u2019t the case.\u00a0 Could it be, then, that people simply fill in the blanks of their memory with archetypes\u2014we remember the Monopoly man with a monocle because we associate the eyepiece with rich old men?",
    "Bainbridge has found that this explanation\u2014known as the \u201cschema theory\u201d\u2014cannot fully explain the Mandela effect either. In one of her experiments, participants were asked to select the correct Fruit of the Loom logo from three images: one without a cornucopia, one with a cornucopia, and one with a plate. Even though we see fruit on plates far more often than we see it inside cornucopias, more participants selected the horn of plenty than the crockery.\u00a0 Bainbridge is drawn to the idea that some images simply cause more false memories than others. \u201cWe think the underlying cause will not likely be a single feature\u2014e.g., attractiveness, color\u2014but how these features work together in relation to things already stored in our memory,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this work is still in its early stages, so we don\u2019t know exactly what that combination is like.\u201d\u00a0  Believers like AJ just aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cIn simulation, anything can happen\u201d \u201cA lot of people remember looking at this unfamiliar object on their underwear tag,\u201d says AJ, \u201cand asking a parent, \u2018Is that a loom?\u2019 and the parents saying, \u2018No! That\u2019s what we call a cornucopia.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 When he was growing up in the \u201970s and \u201980s, AJ wore Fruit of the Loom underwear and regularly folded laundry with his mother. \u201cYou stack up enough underwear, and you\u2019re seeing that logo over and over and over again,\u201d he says. As a newly fledged adult around the late \u201990s, AJ had to go to the store and buy his own underwear for the first time. \u201cI noticed,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the logo had changed, and it was just a pile of fruit.\u201d",
    "Unperturbed, AJ assumed the company had just rebranded\u2014he didn\u2019t worry about it too much until almost two decades later, when he came across the Mandela effect online and realized the consensus was that there had never been a cornucopia. \u201cWe call it the wave of 2016 in the Mandela effect community\u2014it was this huge rush of many, many effects that were being noticed,\u201d he says.\u00a0 The first time he heard about the Mandela effect, AJ says, he \u201cactually swooned\u201d because of an \u201coverwhelming existential dread that something was dreadfully wrong with reality itself.\u201d\u00a0 Today, AJ believes in numerous instances of the Mandela effect, all of which have been shown to be incorrect but nonetheless have robust believer communities online: that the pizza roll brand used to be called Tostino\u2019s, not Totino\u2019s; that the location of Australia has moved on the world map; that the show Sex and the City was Sex in the City; Froot Loops cereal was formerly Fruit Loops; human organs have shifted positions; the sun changed color from yellow to white \u2026 For him, each is just one part of a larger problem he can\u2019t explain about the universe. At first, AJ says, he sought answers by researching memory science and psychology, but he was left unsatisfied. So instead, he looked to quantum mechanics and metaphysics, specifically ontology\u2014the study of reality.",
    "Related StoryUseful quantum computing is inevitable\u2014and increasingly imminentRead next In 2003, the philosopher Nick Bostrom\u2014famous for his theories on the threat of AI \u201csuperintelligence\u201d\u2014posited that humanity may be living inside a simulation. Almost two decades later, the astronomer David Kipping performed some calculations and put the odds at 50-50. \u201cIn simulation, anything can happen,\u201d AJ says. \u201cYou could have different servers\u2014one server hasn\u2019t been updated, some people are seeing one version, some people are seeing the other.\u201d It is also possible, AJ argues, that we exist in a multiverse\u2014an idea first floated by the physicist Hugh Everett III in the 1950s. If people are somehow traveling between these parallel universes, then they may have memories from different worlds. Both of these theories are recurrent in the Mandela effect community online.\u00a0\u00a0 And yet AJ doesn\u2019t find these explanations entirely fulfilling: \u201cIf we jumped universes, why would there be residue?\u201d Instead, he\u2019s been diving into a combination of the theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler\u2019s concept of the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)\u2014which suggests, controversially, that the act of observation creates reality\u2014and the Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Eugene Wigner\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d experiment, which theorized that two observers can experience two different realities. AJ believes that physicists\u2019 own work may be affecting the universe: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re changing the parameters of reality itself by digging deeper.\u201d\u00a0 There is still so much that the experts themselves can\u2019t explain about quantum physics, so it\u2019s no wonder that laypeople get confused. The internet offers myriad rabbit holes to go down, some of them legitimate and some of them less so. Things are complicated further when YouTubers and internet commenters who aren\u2019t well versed in the science take specific, highly complex theories and experiments and try to apply them to other phenomena, even if there is no concrete evidence they\u2019re related. So I set about emailing physicists, simply to see whether they believe it might be remotely possible that quantum physics could, in fact, explain the Mandela effect. Numerous academics replied telling me they had nothing to say on the topic; Bostrom\u2019s office said he was unavailable. I asked the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli\u2014who has been labelled one of the world\u2019s 50 top thinkers\u2014whether he has any thoughts about Mandela effect believers\u2019 quantum-physics-related theories. \u201cYes, definitely,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey are all total bullshit! There are few things about which I am totally convinced. This is one.\u201d\u00a0 I contacted the University of Oxford physicist David Deutsch\u2014often called the \u201cfather of quantum computing\u201d\u2014and listed the theories believers think may explain the Mandela effect, including parallel universes, simulations, the holographic principle, PAP, and Wigner\u2019s friend idea. \u201cConsidered as explanations of the Mandela effect, none of those follow from quantum theory, and none of them constitute a rational speculation beyond it,\u201d he said. Johns Hopkins University professor and physicist Sean M. Carroll concurs: \u201cI cannot imagine how any of those phenomena could be in any way related to the Mandela effect.\u201d\u00a0 Melvin Vopson, an associate professor of physics at the University of Portsmouth who has conducted research on the simulation theory, admits he has experienced the Mandela effect himself but doesn\u2019t attribute the phenomenon to glitches in the simulation: That\u2019d be a \u201ccheap explanation,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, scientists waving away these explanations could have a detrimental effect: In the absence of expert engagement, there are plenty of people online who can bolster believers\u2019 views. AJ is not surprised by these responses: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that physicists have given it a real hard look,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they\u2019re already certain that it\u2019s explainable otherwise.\u201d\u00a0 Bainbridge, for her part, thinks her study at least disproves the theory that we\u2019ve been jumping between different universes. When she took those study participants who weren\u2019t familiar with certain logos and mascots and showed them the correct version for the first time, she tested their memory by asking them to redraw the image only moments later, and still some drew the Mandela effect version.\u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we jumped dimensions during that short time span,\u201d she says, \u201cso it seems like the Mandela effect is something more about the shortcuts our memories take, rather than something about parallel worlds.\u201d She hopes her future work will help further elucidate these \u201cshortcuts,\u201d and she is even planning to see whether she can create her own Mandela effects.\u00a0 Leaving it all behind One of the most well-documented memory phenomena is the \u201cmisinformation effect.\u201d Since the 1970s, scientists have demonstrated that exposing people to misinformation after an event can alter their memories. If people are asked leading questions\u2014say, \u201cDid you see the broken headlight?\u201d rather than \u201cDid you see a broken headlight?\u201d after witnessing a crash\u2014they are more likely to report seeing something they didn\u2019t. But on the flip side, warning witnesses about the threat of misinformation before they recount an event can increase the accuracy of their memory.\u00a0 In short, the way information is presented to us is crucial. This is why it was pretty poor form for YouGov to poll Americans about the Fruit of the Loom logo with a question that was easily open to misinterpretation: \u201cDoes the logo for the clothing company Fruit of the Loom have a cornucopia of fruit in it, or not?\u201d It is unclear here which part is in question\u2014the cornucopia or the fruit. But it was also poor form that I didn\u2019t mention this until now\u2014nor did I mention that Neil deGrasse Tyson later changed his mind about simulation theory and is now \u201cconvinced\u201d that we do not live in a simulation.\u00a0 It was also probably pretty misleading of me to start this article with a link-free reference to Brooke Hermann\u2019s eBay-listed shirt, which she believes features a cornucopia but to my eyes clearly features brown leaves. From the \u201960s to the early \u201900s, the Fruit of the Loom logo did include brown leaves behind the fruit; they were recolored green in 2003. When I started writing this article, I was certain that my Fruit of the Loom childhood PE kit had a cornucopia on the tag. I\u2019m now convinced that 10-year-old me simply wasn\u2019t looking that closely and thus I\u2019ve misremembered the leaves as a horn. After all, even when I look at the current logo on shirts listed on the Fruit of the Loom website, my eyes still seem to want to make this mistake: From far away, I interpret the crowded cluster as a cornucopia.      The current Fruit of the Loom logo (left) and the version submitted in their 1973 trademark design application. Neither contain a cornucopia.  It\u2019s as easy as that to convince me my memory was wrong\u2014whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing, I\u2019ll let you decide. I\u2019m clearly at one end of some sort of spectrum here. Other Mandela effect experiencers may believe something stranger is going on but are still prepared to happily get on with their lives. Larry Jung is a thirtysomething musician who was living in New Jersey when he spent hours hunting for Fruit of the Loom residue; in 2019, he even purchased a copy of a 1969 book for around $20 so he could see the cornucopia reference within it. \u201cI did obsess about it for a while in the beginning,\u201d says Jung, who remembers the cornucopia because he mistook it for a croissant as a child. \u201cBut then\u2014I don\u2019t know, I just came to this acceptance phase. I just didn\u2019t want it to affect my life in a big way. I didn\u2019t want to bring it up in every discussion.\u201d\u00a0 Or, as another erstwhile Mandela effect researcher puts it: \u201cIf I just so happened to be living in a computer simulation, and that was my entire reality, what can I do about that?\u201d Don, the Mandela effect subreddit moderator, has seen waves of people move on while he has stayed active in the community for the better part of a decade (I first spoke to him for my New Statesman article in 2016). \u201cI\u2019ve recruited a lot of moderators, and they come and go pretty quick,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Don says he experiences \u201cmore than average but less than all\u201d examples of the Mandela effect (he too remembers the cornucopia on his childhood underpants). \u201cThey find solutions that they find acceptable,\u201d he says of some people who leave the sub. For others, the cognitive dissonance becomes \u201ctoo much,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt interferes with their ability to function.\u201d Don theorizes that the people who stay are people who experienced the Mandela effect organically, \u201cin the wild,\u201d he says, \u201cbefore it was a well-known phenomenon\u201d\u2014arguably the antithesis of people jumping on an internet bandwagon.  \u201cI compare it to someone who saw Bigfoot. If you were in the woods and Bigfoot walks into your campground and he scares you and your kids, eight feet tall, smells terrible\u2014you\u2019re not going to forget it.\u201d\u00a0 AJ concurs that \u201canchor memories\u201d like these are key. And yet Jung has a croissant-based anchor memory, and I myself have similar anecdotes about false memories I\u2019ve found easy to let go. Psychologically, why does the Mandela effect affect people in such vastly different ways? Why do some people hold onto their memories while others don\u2019t?\u00a0 \u201cWe know that most people\u2019s intuitions about memory are wrong; they think of it as an accurate recording device when in fact memory is a reconstructive apparatus that is presenting us with recollections based on very fragmented snippets,\u201d says Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol who writes computer simulations of memory to better understand how the mind works. \u201cSo most people will have an exaggerated sense of the accuracy of their own memories and will refuse to accept that they could be completely false.\u201d In recent years, Lewandowsky has studied misinformation and has coauthored The Conspiracy Theory Handbook, and he says that while some people move on from their conspiracy theories, others turn them into their identity. \u201cThey will enter a state,\u201d he says, \u201cin which they are extremely difficult to extract from their rabbit hole.\u201d People who become highly committed to conspiracies \u201ctend to be disgruntled and feel left behind by society and are extremely distrustful,\u201d Lewandowsky adds. \u201cThose people also tend to be high in narcissism and often exhibit paranoid thoughts.\u201d\u00a0 Shauna Bowes is an assistant psychology professor at the University of Alabama who researches conspiratorial ideation, misinformation, and intellectual humility. Her work has found that people with this last quality\u2014the tendency to acknowledge the limits of your own views\u2014are less likely to believe misinformation.\u00a0 \u201cBelief perseverance is when you double down on your beliefs, even if evidence contradicts them,\u201d Bowes says. \u201cThere are many reasons why some are willing to change their minds while others do not. Personality traits, childhood experiences, social networks, cognitive styles, and more determine these processes. What we do know is that people who tend to be more cognitively flexible, humble, and generally open-minded also tend to change their minds more in response to evidence.\u201d\u00a0 And yet when it comes to the Mandela effect, the question of \u201cevidence\u201d is a complicated one\u2014after all, there\u2019s plenty of cornucopia residue. Part of the trouble with understanding people\u2019s responses to the Mandela effect is that the phenomenon can\u2019t neatly be categorized as misinformation or conspiracy theory.\u00a0 Lewandowsky believes the Mandela effect is primarily a social phenomenon. \u201cMy take on it is that if many people believe that an event has happened, that becomes a social norm that other people can support by sharing that belief. Social norms are very powerful,\u201d he says, adding that the internet \u201cprovides a great amplification machine.\u201d  Creating reality AJ tells me that even though skeptics have called him \u201cso many derogatory names over the last nine years,\u201d he remains passionate about spreading word of the Mandela effect. He wants to \u201cpush a dialogue\u201d so that believers don\u2019t feel afraid to speak out. Mostly, AJ wants scientists to look at the qualitative side of things: the hundreds of autobiographical accounts by people with very specific memories of things that are now officially said not to have happened the way they recall. He wishes scientists would speak to experiencers directly, the same way the once-skeptical astronomer Josef Allen Hynek spoke to UFO eyewitnesses in the mid-20th century.\u00a0 \u201cOnce upon a time, the UFO phenomenon was considered to be fringe. And now we have multiple world governments that have acknowledged that there is stuff flying around that we don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d AJ says. Overall, \u201cthe goal is to get the scientific establishment to at least consider the other side.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, AJ is not alone, even if Mandela effect believers do exist on a spectrum. The community holds space for people having fun with the phenomenon, for those committed to just a single example of the effect, for others who dive in on a short-term basis before moving on\u2014and for those who have run the International Mandela Effect Conference in locations across the US since 2019.\u00a0 And there\u2019s Don, who is still moderating the subreddit after all these years and has seen believers of every stripe. \u201cThe thing that keeps me going is I want to make sure that it\u2019s still here,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history here, and I want to keep it around for that reason.\u201d\u00a0 Personally, he believes there may be different explanations for different examples of the Mandela effect. It could be as simple as people confusing Fruit of the Loom with a knockoff brand, he says, or as complicated as Fruit of the Loom lying about the cornucopia as free advertising (though he also notes that no one has ever actually discovered an old Fruit of the Loom label with a cornucopia on it).\u00a0 Don also wonders whether some people might be guinea pigs caught up in longitudinal studies in which psychologists play with subjects\u2019 memories. He\u2019s considered, too, that nefarious tech bros could be digitally manipulating and deleting data on the internet as a form of social engineering, a possibility he compares to the Cambridge Analytica affair. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s possible. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is the kind of thing that could be being done.\u201d (To be clear: Don shared no evidence that this is being done.)\u00a0 Perhaps Don\u2019s most interesting belief is that the Mandela effect is not a phenomenon but an \u201cevent\u201d\u2014one that may now in fact be over. In his opinion, there have been no significant or \u201cpersuasive\u201d examples discovered since 2019 (when Redditors found that the character Baloo in Disney\u2019s 1967 The Jungle Book never wore a coconut bra). Don believes the community peaked between 2015 and 2018, when people were making new discoveries regularly. \u201cThere was a period of time where it was an actual event, like this was an ongoing event,\u201d he says. He compares the whole thing to medieval manias in which people danced themselves to death: \u201cI think the fervor with which the Mandela effect spread will likely be compared to dancing plagues by future generations.\u201d Toward the end of my second of three calls with AJ, he asked me if I\u2019d also experienced the Mandela effect. I explained that historically I experienced it with Fruit of the Loom, but I\u2019m prepared to believe it was just a false memory. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fair,\u201d he said. But I started to wonder if it is. When I wrote about the Mandela effect in 2016, I wanted to write an exciting story with twists and turns, which arguably played up the mystery. Am I responsible for making some people question reality? What are the consequences of writing another article, the one you\u2019re currently reading? How much am I creating reality by observing it? To be \u201cfair\u201d to AJ, should I tell you that one of memory science\u2019s most famous studies has recently come under fire, and some academics now believe that people aren\u2019t as susceptible to false memories as we once thought?\u00a0 Or to be \u201cfair\u201d to you, the reader, should I stress that despite my own desire to believe in the mysteries of the universe, I\u2019ve come away thinking that the biggest mystery of all is the human mind?\u00a0 Amelia Tait is a London-based freelance features journalist who writes about culture, trends, and unusual phenomena.\u00a0 hide"
