    "What\u2019s happened?The monetary policy committee of the Bank of Japan (BOJ, the\u00a0central bank) voted overwhelmingly (by eight to one) to\u00a0keep the policy rate unchanged at 0.25% at a meeting that concluded on December\u00a019th. This followed its\u00a0historic exit\u00a0from the negative interest rate in March 2024 and\u00a0an increase\u00a0in its policy rate from 0% to 0.25% in July 2024, after a prolonged period of ultra-accommodative monetary\u00a0policy.Why does it matter?The BOJ\u2019s decision to stay on hold this time does not spell the end of its normalisation. Instead,\u00a0EIU\u00a0expects the central bank to raise its policy rate by 25\u00a0basis points in January 2025, in the first of two quarter-percentage-point increases across the year.\u00a0However, the central bank will maintain a cautious approach, ready to pause monetary normalisation, as it recognises that the real economy needs room to adjust to higher interest\u00a0rates.The risks facing Japan\u2019s economy are multifold. On one hand, the\u00a0economy has recovered modestly, with some incipient signs of improving private consumption despite persistent inflation. Employment and income have been on a mild improving trend, and expectations for inflation remain elevated. On\u00a0the other hand, there are pockets of weakness in the economy. Global uncertainty is on the rise, and this appears to be affecting business sentiment with regard to recruitment and spending plans for\u00a02025.Domestically, the rise in political uncertainty will hold back business and household confidence and is negative for the effectiveness of government policy. The\u00a0fact that the government introduced a large\u00a0fiscal stimulus package\u00a0in November indicates that it is aware of the substantial downside\u00a0risk.In our view, the Japanese economy has performed better recently than it had done in the recent past, having exited deflation and with plenty of signs of green shoots. However, an\u00a0aggressive normalisation of monetary policy that brings about a rapid rise in interest rates could spoil the party.Hence,\u00a0the BOJ will remain cautious, to prevent its policy normalisation from causing an economic recession or undermining its success in reflating the economy. The pace of interest-rate increases will depend largely on the strength and durability of wage growth, as the central bank aims to cultivate a positive growth cycle driven by consumption in the private sector, which is not yet\u00a0assured.What next?Based on our baseline forecast, which expects 0.8% GDP growth and 2.2% average inflation in 2025, we believe that the BOJ will lift the policy rate to 0.75% by year-end, from 0.25% at end-2024. The\u00a0central bank will also unwind its quantitative easing and reduce the size of its balance sheet by scaling back its purchase of ten-year government bonds and exchange-traded funds. This will offer some support for the yen, which has weakened considerably in 2024. However,\u00a0we\u00a0continue to believe that the key risk to this scenario could come from heightened global risks\u00a0that could affect the manufacturing sector and job market in Japan. Any\u00a0signs of growth falling sharply below the baseline would persuade the BOJ to slow its monetary\u00a0normalisation.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from\u00a0EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
