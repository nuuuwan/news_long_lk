    "In a crowded marketplace, traditional attention-grabbing marketing tactics often come off as narcissistic and off-putting. Brands can create meaningful awareness by embodying heroic qualities\u2014acting as guardians against injustice, prioritizing others\u2019 needs selflessly, and serving as mentors and role models. Successful campaigns, like Carrefour\u2019s defiance of archaic agricultural laws or Domino\u2019s pothole-filling initiative, demonstrate these traits, leading to increased consumer trust and brand loyalty. A four-part framework can guide brands in creating effective hero campaigns by addressing significant social issues with genuine effort and broad resonance. As brands increasingly take on roles akin to social activists, their power and responsibility to contribute positively to society become paramount, shifting from traditional CSR to authentic societal betterment.",
    "In the summer of 2018, a curious news story began to make the rounds on social media: Domino\u2019s Pizza was filling potholes in towns across America, leaving a branded sticker on the freshly laid asphalt. The initiative, playfully named \u201cPaving for Pizza,\u201d was a practical response to a common nuisance \u2014 the potholes that can wreak havoc on cars, buses, and yes, pizza deliveries. The pizza company humorously explained that it was working to ensure smooth rides so its pizzas would arrive unscathed.",
