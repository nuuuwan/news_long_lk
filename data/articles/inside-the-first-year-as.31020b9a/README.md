Becoming a CEO is a transition unlike any other. After the pressure and excitement of the appointment process, the real work begins. Expectations are never higher, the learning curve is never steeper, and it doesn’t take long for people to form opinions of a CEO’s performance.

Russell Reynolds Associates conducted a study to better understand this pivotal time in a CEO’s journey. We found that, of the CEOs who left their roles in Q1 2024, 15% had held the job for less than 24 months — that’s up from almost 10% in 2019. And that doesn’t mean the remaining 85% are necessarily successful. Normal distribution indicates that approximately 80% sit in the middle of the curve with mixed performance, and only around 10–15% are high performers.

CEO performance reverberates well beyond the corner office, affecting everyone from employees to shareholders, governments to business partners. Getting a good start is critically important to medium- and long-term success, for both the CEO and the organization. But how can newly appointed CEOs succeed when the role is so different from any they’ve held before? Our study looked closely at what new CEOs focus on, what surprises them during their transitions, and what regrets they have. CEOs who have gotten off to a good start offer plenty of lessons for successfully planning, executing, and navigating the transition.

New CEOs’ Top Priorities

We completed 35 interviews with CEOs who had been in their roles for 12 to 18 months. We also collected quantitative data from a group of 178 CEOs, made up of 69% men and 31% women, with 66% having been appointed from outside the company and 34% having advanced to the role internally.

We asked participants to rank five priorities in order of importance. We found that both experienced CEOs (that is, those on their second or third CEO role) and first-timers prioritized meeting with, assessing, changing, and hiring members of their senior leadership team first. Their second priority was reviewing and designing the company strategy, followed by performance, culture, and board engagement.

We found that CEOs in transition cannot move fast enough to put together and get to know their top team. But making changes to the senior leadership team is only part of the equation. And how fast is optimal? How long is too long to wait? We asked participants to address three specific milestones:

How long did you wait to make the first change to your team? The average time taken for a transitioning CEO to make the first change to their leadership team was 2.8 months. Every CEO participant had met this milestone.

How long did it take to get right people in place? The average time for a CEO to get the “right people” in place on the senior leadership team jumped to 9.2 months, with much greater variation depending on experience. The fastest participant completed their desired appointments within 4.5 months.

How long did it take for the team to start performing well? The final milestone was most elusive: The average tenure of the CEOs interviewed was 14.25 months, and more than half (55%) said that they were still working to get their team performing well.

Our findings suggest the most significant factor in determining speed of leadership team changes was CEO experience. Their ability to move quickly on altering their teams was often dictated by their comfort with and appetite for making changes.

The second factor was whether the CEO was an internal successor or external hire. An internal successor brings the distinct advantage of familiarity with the existing team, which typically allows them to reach actionable judgments on their team faster. Internal successors often considered their Day 1 as the date of their appointment (usually up to three months before their official start date). Contrast that with external hires, who view Day 1 as the first day they start their new job.

The third factor was whether the business was performing well or underperforming. On average, CEOs in businesses recovering from a period of underperformance made their first team change in 1.1 months — less than a third of the time it took CEOs of businesses that were performing well (3.5 months).

The senior leadership team is one of the key levers for CEOs. Without an effective team, a CEO’s ability to deliver change will be significantly impeded. Simultaneously, putting together the team is often a long, continual process. Understanding that it takes a year or more to get to that point is an important consideration for how new CEOs manage their own expectations of performance as well as those of the board, organization, and market.

What Surprises New CEOs

Since few CEOs are truly ready when they take the role, we were keen to understand what they considered the most significant surprises. Answers fell into these broad categories:

The most frequently cited surprise for new CEOs was the culture of the business, with 75% reporting feeling negatively surprised by the reality of the culture they had stepped into.

There was a similarly pessimistic outlook regarding the state of the business, with 63% finding the financial or operational state of the business to be worse than they expected.

89% of respondents were positively surprised by employees’ quality and dedication.

45% said they spent more time on board-related activities than they expected.

36% reported that the emotional weight of the role was a surprise and challenge.

Even CEOs who were promoted from within and have a healthy understanding of the company will run into surprises once they’re viewing things through the CEO lens. Knowing in advance that they’re likely to be surprised by aspects of the company culture, the state of the business, board demands, and their own emotional investment can help new CEOs prepare for their transition and spot signs of trouble early on.

We asked the new CEOs to reflect on their first 12 months in the role and asked if they would do anything differently if they had to do it all over again.

The most common response (66%) was that they would move faster on making changes to and building their teams. In line with our predictions, this reflection was most prominent among second- and third-time CEOs, who had the benefit of previous tenures as CEO to reinforce this message.

What was therefore unexpected was that this same group was actually slower to make team changes. Comparing first-time CEOs and experienced CEOs — all external hires — revealed that on average, first-timers are making their first change at 2.6 months — over a month faster than the experienced average of 4 months. Experience, our research suggests, is no guarantee of speed.

At 48%, the next-most-common new CEO regret was about adapting their leadership style. This manifests in:

Assertiveness, or “trusting their gut” when making decisions, likely paralleling their first regret on not moving faster on their teams.

Transparency, or how well the CEOs felt they had taken the board and organization with them through any changes.

Mentality. Of those who cited approach/leadership style as their top regret, 25% said they felt they took too long to mentally step into the CEO position — that is, they were still thinking and acting as if they were in their previous role (be it CFO, COO, or a divisional CEO).

Finally, 25% of CEOs wished they had engaged better with the board during their transition. The elevation to working more closely and directly with the board is widely considered a distinguishing feature of the CEO role — but one not without its difficulties. As one CEO put it, “You move from having one boss to having multiple.” Overlay onto this statistic and sentiment that just over 63% of participants reported having some sort of conflict with the board in their first year as CEO and a picture starts to emerge of CEOs in transition being comparatively less-well-prepared to handle the board interaction in comparison to other elements of the job.

The CEO role is complex, intense, and demanding. It’s a difficult transition to make, but new CEOs can benefit from understanding the top priorities, regrets, and surprises their peers experienced during their transitional periods. A CEO in transition is an organization in transition, and both must support each other to succeed.
