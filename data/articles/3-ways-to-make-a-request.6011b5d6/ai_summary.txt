Research indicates that employees often feel pressured to agree to tasks or requests, leading to feelings of frustration and resentment. Various strategies have been put forth to help employees say no, however such strategies tend to place the responsibility of refusal solely on the worker. Beginning requests with phrases such as “Don't answer right now. Think about it and get back to me tomorrow”, asking employees to respond over email instead of in person, and providing an example of how to say no, can help make employees feel more comfortable in refusing tasks. Research into making requests in this way found that while it did not affect the overall number of agreements, it did help people feel that their agreement was more voluntary.
