Sri Lanka's demographics divide the population into the majority Sinhalese group (74.9%) and three minority groups, Sri Lankan Tamils (11.1%), Muslims (9.3%), and Hill Country Tamils (4.1%). The proportions of these groups can influence election outcomes. Current president Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has traditionally been popular among the Tamil and Muslim voters, is seeking to regain support from these communities after losing it in the 2020 parliamentary elections to the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa. Wickremesinghe is expected to contest as a non-party independent candidate, but it is unclear whether the split Muslims and Tamil MPs and parties will fully support him due to vote transferability considerations.
