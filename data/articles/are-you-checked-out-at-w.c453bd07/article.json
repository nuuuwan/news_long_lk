    "Research shows that disengaging from our jobs can impact our mental health, motivation, stress levels, responsiveness, and even cognitive function. Worse, withdrawal is self-perpetuating, triggering a troubling cycle that can be difficult to break. If you\u2019re looking to re-engage at work in the new year, incorporating more purposeful interactions into your workday can help. These can interrupt the withdrawal spiral, decreasing loneliness and bringing back your energy, creativity, and sense of purpose.
