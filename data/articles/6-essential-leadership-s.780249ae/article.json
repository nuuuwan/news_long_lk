    "The way we work has changed \u2014 and so has leadership.",
    "\u201cThe best leaders of the twentieth century were question answerers, setting the vision and strategy from above,\u201d says Kirstin Lynde, founder of the leadership development firm Catalyze Associates. \u201cBut the best leaders in the twenty-first century are question askers. They seek feedback and new perspectives, and they ask curious questions about themselves, their teams, and their environment.\u201d",
    "The pandemic also had a profound and lasting impact on leadership dynamics, notes Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, a behavioral scientist at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cWhere people were in their lives during lockdown \u2014 whether starting college, beginning a job search, stepping into a managerial role, or juggling remote work with parenting \u2014 has shaped who they are today,\u201d he says. \u201cLeaders need to be attuned to these dynamic forces and adapt to the different needs and challenges their teams face.\u201d",
    "This transformation extends beyond individual experiences, adds Shimul Melwani, associate professor of organizational behavior at Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019re facing massive technological shifts with AI,\u201d she says. \u201cWorkers are increasingly demanding flexibility, purpose, and work-life balance, all while organizations navigate an era of value polarization.\u201d",
    "Given these changes, our experts highlight six leadership skills that have become essential in today\u2019s workplace and offer practical advice on how to develop them.",
    "1. Emotional Aperture",
    "This term, coined by Sanchez-Burks, captures the ability to understand and tune into the emotional dynamics of your people. \u201cIt\u2019s about reading the room, gauging the collective mood, and recognizing the emotional landscape of your team,\u201d he says. Is everyone on the same page, or is there unspoken tension? Is there cohesion, or are there gaps in understanding? Are all voices being heard, or are some perspectives missing?",
    "Successful leaders pick up on these signals to gain a deeper understanding of how their team members process information, approach risk, and maintain commitment. This heightened awareness builds stronger relationships and fosters deeper connections, which in turn drives retention and employee engagement. \u201cIt\u2019s a rich source of information that helps you keep people around a little longer and lean in a little more.\u201d",
    "How to tune into the emotional dynamics of your team",
    "Developing this skill takes practice and intentional effort, says Sanchez-Burks. He recommends seeking out resources that focus on group dynamics and collective emotions. Self-reflection exercises, such as journaling about team interactions and your interpretations of them, can also improve your awareness over time.",
    "Lynde advises regular temperature checks with your team. At your next group meeting, try this exercise: Ask everyone to write down (anonymously or not) three things they love about their work that motivate them, and three things that are frustrating. After collecting the responses, take some time to review and synthesize the feedback. Then, share the common themes with the group. Talk about the positives and the pain points. Be open and honest; transparency helps build morale and trust within the team.\u00a0\u201cYou might not be able to solve every problem, but this is a magical way to make your team feel that their leader cares about them,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want to feel heard.\u201d",
    "Practice sharpening your emotional radar outside of work, too, adds Sanchez-Burks. Try observing conversations in public spaces like caf\u00e9s. Pay attention to emotional undertones, reactions, and how people connect (or don\u2019t). Notice the nuances in their relationships and look for non-verbal cues like facial expressions, body language, and even silence. Think of it as people-watching with purpose. \u201cHave fun with it,\u201d he says.",

    "2. Adaptive Communication",
    "This skill involves knowing how and when to adjust your behavior and leadership style to fit the situation and your audience. Successful leaders adapt their approach to meet the moment and boost overall team performance. \u201cLeaders need to know how to move hearts and minds,\u201d says Sanchez-Burks. \u201cThat means not just understanding how others feel, but using that knowledge to influence, motivate, and guide.\u201d",
    "Connecting with the group\u2019s emotional energy can make a difference in your problem-solving and relationship-building; it helps you work toward a compelling vision. Simply put: Vibes matter.",
    "If you need your team to rally around a project or organizational goal, for instance, maintaining a positive, consistent emotional tone helps everyone focus and reach the finish line. But when the game plan involves a complex challenge related to business strategy, allowing a mix of emotions can bring out different ideas. \u201cEmotional diversity sparks creativity,\u201d Sanchez-Burks adds.",
    "How to get better at adjusting your style to fit the moment and your audience",
    "\u201cThe golden rule \u2014 treat people as you would like to be treated \u2014 is outdated,\u201d says Lynde. \u201cIt\u2019s now the platinum rule: treat people as they want to be treated.\u201d",
    "This requires a concerted effort at relationship building. Whether you\u2019re part of a team or leading one, carve out time for one-on-one conversations to understand what your colleagues care about, their priorities, and how they see the world. Empathize.\u00a0Make a genuine effort to understand your colleagues\u2019 perspectives and feelings.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do all the talking,\u201d Lynde says. \u201cAsk questions and really listen.\u201d",
    "Lynde also recommends tools like the DISC assessment, a measure of interpersonal behavior, or the Lifo survey, which looks at individual work styles, to gain deeper insights into people\u2019s personalities. \u201cThese provide a new lens to see each other. Some people are down-to-business and task-oriented, while others are more people-oriented.\u201d",
    "Sanchez-Burks notes that we often instinctively try to change a colleague\u2019s feelings \u2014 by cheering them up or calming them down. Sometimes, simply acknowledging their emotions is enough. \u201cLetting someone know you understand their feelings without trying to change them helps in building trust.\u201d",
    "Mindful reflection can also be helpful here. Before a meeting or important conversation, set clear goals for what you want to achieve and how you want to be perceived. Afterward, review how well you met those goals and consider any tweaks for next time. This practice helps develop self-awareness and adaptability.",
    "Read More: As Your Team Gets Bigger, Your Leadership Style Has to Adapt",
    "When things feel unpredictable and uncertain, there\u2019s a natural tendency to become rigid in your thinking, which limits your ability to weigh different solutions to problems. But to be an effective leader in challenging times, you must be able to juggle competing priorities and hold opposing ideas in your head. \u201cLeaders need to be open to paradox,\u201d says Melwani.",
    "This means embracing ambiguity, seeking out new perspectives, and understanding the larger context. When leaders signal they\u2019re open to new opinions, research shows that team members feel safer sharing their ideas, ultimately leading to more thoughtful decisions and stronger outcomes. \u201cThriving amid uncertainty means leaning into it, not shying away,\u201d she says.",
    "How to boost your mental agility",
    "Dealing with the unknown is inherently challenging and sometimes downright scary. \u201cYou have to keep your knees bent; there are going to be bumps,\u201d says Lynde.",
    "Leaders in the past felt pressure to have all the answers, but the pace of technological change calls for a different approach, she adds. Like AI, problem-solving now centers on skillfully engineering the right prompts rather than storing all the information in your head. \u201cThe big arc for leaders is asking the right questions,\u201d she says.",
    "Asking good questions allows you to \u201cmove beyond your hardened perspective and embrace very different possibilities and ways of thinking,\u201d says Sanchez-Burks.",
    "Melwani recommends activities to boost your mental agility on your own, such as mind mapping. Mind mapping is a technique for diagramming ideas and organizing information in a structure similar to a flowchart, showing relationships between them. You can take meeting notes in mind-map form; you can also experiment with it during group discussions and brainstorming sessions. \u201cIt taps into your creative side,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it helps you visually explore ideas and uncover connections that might not be immediately obvious.\u201d",

    "4. Perspective Seeking, Taking, and Coordinating",
    "Research consistently shows that power reduces empathy and narrows focus. It\u2019s not surprising then that as business leaders rise the corporate ladder, they often rely more on their own opinions and overlook others\u2019 perspectives. But for effective management at any level, it\u2019s essential to actively seek different perspectives and integrate new information into your approach.",
    "This managerial skill is also crucial for tasks like negotiating, managing risk, strategic thinking, and resolving conflicts. \u201cWhen you put yourself in another person\u2019s shoes, you become a more attentive listener and use a broader, more holistic perspective to find the way forward,\u201d says Melwani.",
    "How to broaden your understanding of different perspectives",
    "Regularly reflect on past and future situations where understanding others\u2019 outlooks could improve outcomes. The aim is to interrogate your beliefs and \u201cto get in the minds of others,\u201d Melwani says. Question your assumptions; what you take for granted\u00a0might mask your biggest blind spots.",
    "Melwani also recommends expanding your network both in and outside your organization with people whose worldviews are different from yours. Seek feedback from them and others who can help you uncover your biases and challenge you.",
    "Another effective method? Reading more novels. Fiction immerses you in the perspectives of characters from other backgrounds, including different races, nationalities, and genders. Research suggests this exposure broadens your understanding of different viewpoints and the challenges people face in their lives. \u201cThe more you do this, the more skilled you become,\u201d says Melwani.",
    "Understanding how you come across and how others perceive you is essential for growth, adds Lynde. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s big things you\u2019re off base about; sometimes it\u2019s very little things that are holding you back.\u201d",
    "Read More: How \u201cPerspective Swaps\u201d Can Unlock Organizational Change",
    "5. Strategic Disruption Skills",
    "This is a skill that involves challenging the status quo. Rather than sticking to established conventions, leaders must identify and question outdated practices to explore new ideas that could improve outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s not about breaking rules just for the sake of it, but rather questioning long-standing practices and pushing for continuous learning and improvement,\u201d says Melwani.",
    "This is an especially effective strategy for advancing inclusion and equity in your company and your team. To build a more open and inclusive environment, leaders need to rethink and revise deeply entrenched practices and norms.",
    "How to get more comfortable challenging the status quo",
    "Lynde advises tapping into the ideas and perspectives of others to open up new possibilities. Remember: People on the front lines and colleagues in different departments see things that you might overlook. \u201cThink about how you can, as a leader, get into a habit of dredging their imaginations and minds for ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cNot only are you broadening your own thinking, but you\u2019re also making others feel that their contributions matter.\u201d",
    "She recommends reserving the last 10 minutes of weekly meetings to ask everyone: What could we be doing better? This practice encourages team members to come prepared with suggestions. Even if you\u2019re not officially running meetings, you can still contribute to a culture of innovation by offering ideas for improvement. \u201cStrategy is a shared responsibility,\u201d she says.",
    "Finally, support your team in learning new skills, piloting projects, and learning from failures. Embrace a willingness to take on new challenges and experiment in your own work, too. \u201cTake a cue from software development and adopt an agile approach: test, try, and iterate,\u201d says Lynde.",

    "6. Resilient Self-Awareness",
    "As a leader, you\u2019re expected to be always on call and constantly available to support your employees, whether with work issues or their mental health needs. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to be dissociated\u00a0from your humanity, but leaders are only human, too,\u201d says Sanchez-Burks. \u201cIt can be lonely at the top.\u201d",
    "Self-awareness involves recognizing your own limitations and understanding when to seek support. This important leadership skill is not only about managing your own stress but also about setting a healthy example for your team. By being aware of your needs and boundaries, you demonstrate strength and self-care, which contributes to a positive work environment.",
    "\u201cLeaders face the same challenges as everyone else, managing work, stress, and life demands, but they\u2019re expected to carry the weight for their teams, too,\u201d says Melwani.",
    "How to foster emotional strength and mental endurance",
    "To effectively support your team, you need a strong support network of your own. Melwani recommends seeking resources both inside and outside of work, such as mentors, counselors, and peer groups. Having people who can offer constructive advice is invaluable \u2014 \u201cespecially if they can help with real-time adjustments,\u201d she says.",
    "Lynde suggests a simple yet powerful practice: Regularly ask six to eight people whom know you best at work \u2014 your boss, peers, and direct reports \u2014 for feedback. Ask them: What am I am doing well? And what I could improve? Give them a week to reflect, then follow up for their ideas.",
    "Choose a couple of areas on which to focus, and then follow up with specific questions like: Five months ago, you told me to work on becoming a better listener. I\u2019ve tried not to interrupt and to stay off my phone. How am I doing?",
    "Lynde recommends repeating this process two to three times a year. You might fear that admitting weaknesses will make you seem less competent. \u201cBut really, you\u2019re modeling how to receive feedback,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you seem stronger and more human.\u201d",
    "Sanchez-Burks suggests studying your favorite athletes and drawing inspiration from how they manage their physical and mental states to perform at their best. \u201cPerforming at peak is not sustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to know when to taper, how to recover, and how to build up endurance.\u201d",

    "Developing these six key leadership skills isn\u2019t just about your personal growth, it\u2019s about shaping the future of work and inspiring those around you. Leaders are under new pressures to perform at higher levels and adapt quickly to changing demands. But while \u201cleadership today is harder, it is also more exciting,\u201d says Melwani. \u201cThere is more opportunity to drive real change and to make a lasting positive impact.\u201d",
