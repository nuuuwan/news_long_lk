Facts:
- Quadrature Climate Foundation, a London-based nonprofit, is set to become one of the world’s largest financial backers of solar geoengineering research.
- Quadrature plans to provide $40 million for work in this field over the next three years.
- The amount is double what all foundations and wealthy individuals provided from 2008 through 2018 and nearly equivalent to what the US government has offered to date.
- Other nonprofits, including the Simons Foundation, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Bernard and Anne Spitzer Charitable Trust, have also disclosed funding for solar geoengineering research.
- Mike Schroepfer, Meta's former CTO, is starting a new nonprofit, Outlier Projects, that will provide funding for solar geoengineering and other climate-related research.
- Researchers are exploring ways to reflect sunlight to mitigate climate change, including injecting particles into the stratosphere, spraying salt towards marine clouds, and breaking up heat-trapping cirrus clouds with dust-like material.
- Quadrature's first solar geoengineering grants went towards the University of Washington's Marine Cloud Brightening Program and SilverLining, a nonprofit that pools and distributes grants to solar geoengineering researchers.
- Quadrature’s funding for solar geoengineering represents just 5% of its $930 million portfolio, according to Greg De Temmerman, the organization’s chief science officer.
- Private funding for solar geoengineering research reached about $20 million between 2008 and 2018, while government funding just topped $30 million.

Opinions:
- Greg De Temmerman, Quadrature's chief science officer, believes they can have a strong impact in accelerating research and unlocking public money.
- David Keith, a prominent geoengineering researcher, thinks the increased funding represents a new era for geoengineering, different from the conditions last year.
- Douglas MacMartin, a senior research associate at Cornell, asserts that many people recognize the need for more funding and research to support decisions on solar geoengineering.
- Critics argue that studying solar geoengineering methods may ease the pressure to cut emissions and could lead to their premature deployment.
- Holly Buck, an assistant professor at the University of Buffalo, fears that funding by wealthy individuals could undermine public trust in the scientific realm and perpetuate the notion of putting the climate system under the control of people who have disrupted media, information, and finance ecosystems.
- Lisa Dilling, associate chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, states that their program will include advocating for more public funding.
- Dakota Gruener, founder of Reflective, believes transparency is the only way to build trust and aims to ensure their governance structure and research outcomes are public, understandable, and readily available.
- Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, urges for taking solar geoengineering more seriously.
- Duncan McLaren, a climate intervention fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles, warns that privately funded research could result in overly optimistic answers about what solar geoengineering could do.
