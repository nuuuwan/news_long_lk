The author, D.B.S. Jeyaraj, analyzes how incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe's popularity among minority ethnic groups could influence his candidacy in the 2024 Sri Lankan presidential elections. According to the last official census in 2012, Sinhalese made up the majority of Sri Lanka's population at 74.9%, with the Sri Lankan Tamils (11.1%), Muslims or Moors (9.3%), and Indian-origin Tamils (4.1%) making up the rest. Together, these minority groups form the majority in certain districts and continue to play crucial roles in the island nation's presidential elections.

Historically, Wickremesinghe has enjoyed substantial support from Tamil and Muslim voters, which has influenced previous elections. However, following the 2020 Parliamentary elections, where the United National Party (UNP) he leads suffered a substantial blow, this dynamic may change. A group of MPs broke away from UNP to form Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) under Sajith Premadasa and captured a significant portion of the Tamil and Muslim vote, leading to UNP's worst electoral performance in history.

Now the question is whether Wickremesinghe can regain this lost support for the 2024 presidential elections. The author examines how each minority group might lean, noting the complexities within their representative parties and the potential for splits. Despite the challenges, Wickremesinghe has made efforts to appeal to minority voters, which include a significant wage hike for plantation workers, a primarily Tamil workforce. However, the author also identified potential deterrents, such as fielding a common Tamil presidential candidate and the harsh government crackdown on peaceful Tamil commemorations. The response to these actions could inform Wickremesinghe's chances in the upcoming elections.
