The article focuses on the importance of ethnic minority votes in Sri Lankan elections and how incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe might fare in the 2024 presidential polls given recent political dynamics. The Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims, and Indian Tamils, who together make up 25.5% of the population, can have a significant impact on the presidential elections. Wickremesinghe has generally been popular among these communities. His party, the United National Party (UNP), however, suffered a significant blow in the 2020 Parliamentary elections due to a substantial part of its MPs breaking away and forming the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). The current political split between the UNP and SJB is a clash between Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa. The major ethnic parties are increasingly likely to back Wickremesinghe in the 2024 elections, but whether Wickremesinghe will manage to win back votes lost in 2020 remains an open question.
