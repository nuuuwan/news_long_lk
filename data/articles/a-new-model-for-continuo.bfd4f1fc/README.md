Traditionally, transformation efforts are organized as programs with a defined beginning and end. Rooted in a change model popularized by German American psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1950s, this approach involves three stages: ‚Äúunfreeze, change, and refreeze.‚Äù Although it is effective for discrete projects like implementing a new payroll system, this model falls short in today‚Äôs dynamic business environment. The continuous evolution of the external landscape demands ongoing business transformation, with no room for pausing, refreezing, and stepping away. ¬†This article describes the three key strategies needed to support continuous transformation: adopt an agile mindset, use aspirations to continuously challenge and stretch the organization, and build transformation into the company‚Äôs operating rhythm.

Transformation programs have become ubiquitous, with more than one-third of large organizations engaged in some form of transformation at any given time. But the conventional model that most companies rely on for transformation has faltered in the wake of today‚Äôs rapidly changing business environment. Leaders need a fresh approach ‚Äî one better suited to the continuously evolving nature of our world.
