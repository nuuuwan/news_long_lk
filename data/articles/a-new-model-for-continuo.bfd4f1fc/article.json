    "Traditionally, transformation efforts are organized as programs with a defined beginning and end. Rooted in a change model popularized by German American psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1950s, this approach involves three stages: \u201cunfreeze, change, and refreeze.\u201d Although it is effective for discrete projects like implementing a new payroll system, this model falls short in today\u2019s dynamic business environment. The continuous evolution of the external landscape demands ongoing business transformation, with no room for pausing, refreezing, and stepping away. \u00a0This article describes the three key strategies needed to support continuous transformation: adopt an agile mindset, use aspirations to continuously challenge and stretch the organization, and build transformation into the company\u2019s operating rhythm.",
    "Transformation programs have become ubiquitous, with more than one-third of large organizations engaged in some form of transformation at any given time. But the conventional model that most companies rely on for transformation has faltered in the wake of today\u2019s rapidly changing business environment. Leaders need a fresh approach \u2014 one better suited to the continuously evolving nature of our world.",
