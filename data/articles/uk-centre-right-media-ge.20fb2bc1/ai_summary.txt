Facts:
- Social media has been abuzz with talks of a potential third World War, following recent military actions in Ukraine and Gaza.
- These talks, however, are nothing new; there have been war scares since the end of World War II.
- During the Cold War, the US and its NATO allies and the former Soviet Union used misinformation, propaganda, and influence buying as tools in their competition.
- Nuclear threats were present during the Cold War with missiles aimed at both Western and Eastern Europe.
- Such tension almost led to a nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 but was averted when the Soviets chose to remove their missiles from Cuba.
- Proxy wars were used as a means of avoiding full-scale war, such as in Vietnam, Angola, and Afghanistan.
- Anti-war movements emerged in response to the fear of nuclear warfare.
- Andrei Sakharov, considered the father of the first Soviet hydrogen bomb, later called for limitations on these weapons resulting in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT).
- Despite the tensions, a Third World War did not occur during the time of two superpowers, the US and Soviet Union. However, today's world is multipolar with nine countries possessing nuclear weapons, increasing volatility.

Opinions:
- The perception that we are in the throes of a third World War is not entirely correct, as all the propaganda, misinformation, and influence buying wars also happened during the Cold War and did not lead to actual invasions.
- The opinion of the centre-right Daily Telegraph that the Third World War has already begun is closer to Hollywood than factual reportage.
- The idea that the current state of global affairs is akin to a third World War might be considered an overreaction, fueled more by fear than by an objective assessent of the circumstances.
- While a third World War could be a possibility, the assertion that it has already started may be premature.
- The media needs to be responsible in their reporting, given the volatile state of the world today.
