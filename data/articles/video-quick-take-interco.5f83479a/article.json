    "Todd Pruzan, HBR: Welcome to the HBR Video Quick Take. I\u2019m Todd Pruzan, senior editor for research and special projects at Harvard Business Review.",
    "In our rapidly evolving business landscape, artificial intelligence has become a critical tool for customer service, to the point that some would argue customer service leaders who aren\u2019t using AI agents are irresponsible. To talk about why, we\u2019re here with Brian Donahue, Intercom\u2019s Vice President of Product, for his insights. Brian, thanks so much for being with us.",
    "Brian Donahue, Intercom: Hey, Todd. Thanks for having me here.",
    "Todd Pruzan, HBR: So, Brian, you\u2019re making a very strong statement here that leaders who work without AI agents are irresponsible. Why do you make that argument?",
    "Brian Donahue, Intercom: Well, I think amidst all the general hype that\u2019s going on, AI is transforming society. But hey, it\u2019s still all to play out, see how it works. I think it can actually be easy for leaders to fail to recognize that the game has already changed for customer service.",
    "AI agents are delivering massive value today, right now. And like, we really think\u2013 like, we think as builders of this technology who understand its strengths and its limitations, not using it, you\u2019re just leaving a huge opportunity on the table. It\u2019s better for your customers. It\u2019s better for your business. The economics of customer service are actually changing. So I think failing to recognize we\u2019re in this moment means you\u2019re falling behind.",
    "Todd Pruzan, HBR: OK, can you share any examples of the impact AI agents have had on Intercom\u2019s customers?",
    "Brian Donahue, Intercom: Yeah, absolutely. When we launched in over a year ago, well over a year ago, we saw an average resolution rate of 32%. And we\u2019re like, hey, this is good enough. We got to get this out into the market. This is way better than what came before. And that average rate has climbed now to 46%. It\u2019s just been this nice, incremental increase. It\u2019s still climbing.",
    "We see some customers getting above 80% resolution rates. So I mean, if you tell a customer service leader, an AI agent can likely answer nearly half of your incoming volume, it can do that 24/7 in any language. I mean, that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s basically irresponsible not to be using one today.",
    "Here\u2019s a tangible example from one of our customers, a SaaS business called RB2B. So they doubled their user base in two months, and you\u2019d expect that volume for the support team to double. But because they had our AI agent actually working on customer questions over email, their support team actually handled 45% fewer questions. So like, RB2B told us, they think in a year from now, their two support team agents would be like a team of 20. So this gives you a sense of how agents are really dramatically shifting the customer service landscape.",
    "Todd Pruzan, HBR: OK, those are definitely some compelling numbers, but customer support is not just about efficiency. It\u2019s about quality. And leaders care most about the quality of the customer experience they\u2019re delivering. How do you ensure AI agents don\u2019t degrade the quality of support that the end customers are getting?",
    "Brian Donahue, Intercom: Yeah, this is a really important point. This is the single biggest concern we hear. A couple of points to think about here. The first one is don\u2019t equate today\u2019s AI agents with the chat bots of just a couple of years ago. These agents now can engage in human-like dialogue because the conversation abilities have just improved dramatically. These agents sound like humans. And so most people, I think, intuitively get this from their experience of interacting with ChatGPT or similar. So that\u2019s the first point.",
    "Secondly, I think it\u2019s important to think about, from your customer\u2019s perspective, the thing they care about most is getting their problem resolved as quickly as it can. For most of the things your customers are asking you for, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a human who\u2019s actually doing that. They just want their problem solved as fast as possible.",
    "And so what AI agents give you is that chance to get that resolution as fast as possible. That\u2019s a massive change. And if the AI agent can\u2019t answer, then they escalate to a human. And that escalation process, that\u2019s what needs to be transparent, fluid, and efficient.",
    "That\u2019s where the nuances and delicacies of how they answer, where someone can say, yeah, that felt OK\u2013 OK, it couldn\u2019t answer my question, but I\u2019m going to human now. I\u2019m clear on that. How that interaction works can actually be key to whether someone\u2019s kind of frustrated or feels good about that. But ultimately, it\u2019s trying to get the speed of that resolution as fast as possible.",
    "The third thing is actually accuracy. You\u2019ve got to be accurate. That was actually the biggest risk when this technology landed. Can we reduce hallucinations? That\u2019s been a huge focus for us. We\u2019re actually able to get that hallucination rate, that error rate, down to like 0.01%. And so that\u2019s critical.",
    "So basically, when you\u2019re thinking about how is this going to impact my customer experience, you\u2019ve got to remember, one, the quality of human-like interactions. Two is that immediate availability, that chance to get that resolution right away, and three, like, high accuracy\u2013 not being wrong. Those are what we think are the main reasons why you can feel comfortable of using an AI agent even when you want to get the best customer satisfaction.",
    "Todd Pruzan, HBR: OK, well, that\u2019s a great summary. Brian, thank you so much for sharing your insights about AI agents and the role they play in providing customer service responsibly.",
