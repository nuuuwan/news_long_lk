Facts:

- Jamais Cascio, an American anthropologist, developed the BANI world view which stands for Brittle, Anxious, Non-Linear and Incomprehensible. 
- The term BANI is aimed at understanding the myths people create to feel more secure in a world that is uncertain and fragile.
- The terms represent the following concepts: Brittle refers to fragility disguised as strength; Anxious refers to the feeling of helplessness and lack of control due to uncertainty; Non-Linear refers to the unconventional and unpredictable trajectories of events; and Incomprehensible refers to the human inability to fully understand and anticipate world events. 
- Cascioâ€™s work emphasizes the importance of long-term, systemic thinking, and the power of openness, transparency and flexibility in building a more resilient society. 
- In 2017, Cascio was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Advancing Technology for his ongoing work.
- Poson Poya is a significant day in Sri Lankan history, marking the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
- Sri Lanka is presented as a case study of a country experiencing the BANI world with a brittle political setup, and societal anxiety due to indecisiveness from leadership and escalating prices among other challenges.
