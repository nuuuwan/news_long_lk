The article criticizes Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former Sri Lankan leader, for his actions that have led to significant economic and political issues. Rajapaksa is depicted as thriving in an environment of immunity and corruption, typical of many Third World politicians. His tenure saw mismanagement of state resources, including the national carrier and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs), culminating in a severe financial crisis. Despite these failures, Rajapaksa opposes restructuring the loss-making SOEs, aiming to benefit his son Namal politically.

The article suggests Rajapaksa's opposition is a tactic to delay reforms until a new government can be elected, using rising public discontent to his advantage. It labels him and similar figures as unapologetic and thick-skinned, continuing to manipulate the system for personal and familial gain.

Rajapaksa is also critiqued for his "strategic" pricing of fuel and electricity, which led to economic paralysis. In countries with stricter rule of law, like Thailand or Brazil, he would face legal consequences, but Sri Lanka fosters a culture of impunity for its powerful figures.

With Sri Lanka slowly recovering economically, Rajapaksa's recent actions are seen as attempts to destabilize government policies to create chaos from which his family can regain power. The article warns that failure to resist Rajapaksa's schemes may lead to further economic and political turmoil, emphasizing the need for current leaders to uphold reform agendas against such dynastic ambitions.
