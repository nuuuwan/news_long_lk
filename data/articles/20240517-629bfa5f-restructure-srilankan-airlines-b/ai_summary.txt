The article discusses former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's statement on restructuring State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), causing controversy and criticism, particularly from Ranga Jayasuriya in the Daily Mirror. Jayasuriya's focus on SriLankan Airlines is challenged with contrasting financial data, showing a significant reduction in losses and even a potential turnaround to profitability. The article criticizes Jayasuriya for misleading the public and revisits the struggles of global airlines, highlighting that making losses is part of the industry, not unique to SriLankan Airlines.

Historical references, such as the closure of Swissair and the struggles of Malaysian Airlines, underscore the point that maintaining a national carrier is inherently challenging, regardless of ownership. The article defends keeping SriLankan Airlines under state control, especially for national interests, and criticizes the idea of hastily selling SOEs without public mandate and proper elections.

Rajapaksa's statement underscores the need for innovative restructuring rather than privatization, aligning with the people's mandate from past elections. The article calls for any plans to sell SOEs to be postponed until elections are held, allowing the public to decide on such matters through a democratic process.
