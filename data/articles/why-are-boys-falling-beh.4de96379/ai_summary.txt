In Sri Lanka, girls are increasingly outperforming boys in higher education, appearing to show a trend towards a gender gap in education favouring women. Statistics reveal that females made up 64% of all state university enrolments in areas including medicine, dentistry, law, science, IT, education, management and arts. The female to male ratio at other tertiary institutions was 61:39. However, despite their educational success, women still earn less than men in the workplace, pointing to deeper structural issues within the country. The gender gap results in more women needing to acquire more years of formal education to match men's earnings. This could lead to boys: their parents seeing less value in pursuing further education for them due to societal expectations for males to contribute to household income and the perceived high cost and competitiveness of university places. To make learning more attractive for boys, initiatives such as vocational training and work placements may be integrated into the curriculum from primary school level.
