1. 🇱🇰 The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has dismissed a petition requesting that the presidential term is extended to six years.
2. ⚖️ The court stated there was no merit in the plea and the current five-year term limit, established by the 19th Constitutional Amendment, would not be violated.
3. 📜 The petitioner effectively wanted the Supreme Court to review legislation enacted after the 19th amendment - a power the court does not have.
4. 🗳️ The petitioner argued that the five-year term limit imposed by the 19th Amendment violated the entrenched Constitutional provision, Article 3.
5. 👥 Article 3 states that sovereignty is in the people and includes powers of government, fundamental rights, and the franchise.
6. 📖 The petitioner hoped that if the Supreme Court found the 19th Amendment null and void, the original Constitutional provisions would apply and the President would stay in office for an additional year.
7. 🔍 This notion is based on Article 83(b) of the Constitution, untouched by the 19th Amendment, which suggests the presidential term can only be extended beyond six years with parliamentary approval and a public referendum.
8. 💬 Supporters of the government argued that if the presidential term was to be extended by just one year, a referendum would not be necessary.
9. ⌛ Now the plea has been dismissed, there might not be enough time to implement a legal stance based on Articles 83(b), 3, 4, and others.
10. 🔄 The next step would be a potential Bill introducing a six-year term, but it would require Supreme Court approval and either a two-thirds parliamentary majority or a public referendum.
