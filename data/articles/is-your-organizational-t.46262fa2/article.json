    "Nearly all transformation efforts face significant challenges that can derail the whole program. These can range from exogenous shocks, such as inflation, supply-chain disruption, or political events; operating-model issues, such as the need to change technology, governance, or ways of working; or human dynamics, such as employee confidence in or ownership of the change. How can leaders identify these turning points \u2014 and get things back on track? New research, based on surveys of more than 1,600 leaders and employees involved in transformations, suggests that changes in a team\u2019s emotional energy \u2014 their collective mood, vibe, and intensity of emotions \u2014 often signals that there\u2019s an issue. Organizations that successfully navigate these turning points look for shifts in the team\u2019s emotional energy, dig into the underlying issues at play, and quickly take action to create the conditions where teams can thrive.",
    "There comes a moment in almost every organizational transformation \u2014 even the successful ones \u2014 when the program goes off course and leaders need to intervene. As researchers who study transformations, we are often approached by C-suite executives, who ask questions like: What do I do when things go wrong? How can I detect when things may be going off track? Is there a way to use these pivotal moments to my advantage?",
