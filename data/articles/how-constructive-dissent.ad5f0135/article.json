    "The key to unlocking innovation from diverse perspectives is constructive dissent: a team\u2019s ability to engage respectfully in the exchange of conflicting viewpoints. As a norm, or pattern of shared behavior, it brings together creative abrasion, social collaboration, and emotional regulation. If a team can\u2019t find a way to engage in constructive dissent, it will default to preserving the status quo. But if it can, that norm will unleash the team\u2019s innovative capability. The author presents eight practical ways to nurture constructive dissent and release your team\u2019s full innovative potential.",
