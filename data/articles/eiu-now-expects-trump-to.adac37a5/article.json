    "The weeks following the\u00a0first US presidential debate, held on June 27th, have represented a seismic shift in the election\u2019s trajectory. The surprisingly poor debate performance of the Democratic incumbent, Joe Biden, prompted a wave of calls among senior party officials, voters and donors for him to end his campaign in favour of a more convincing candidate. Mr Biden\u2019s slipping polling numbers and the party\u2019s indecision over how to proceed have only benefited his Republican rival, Donald Trump, overshadowing the Trump campaign\u2019s own weaknesses. Mr Trump\u2019s standing has also benefited from a failed assassination attempt on July 13th, although we expect that the shooting\u2019s overall impact on the election will be\u00a0much more limited\u00a0than Mr Biden\u2019s debate fiasco. Democrats still have options for reviving their campaign, but the prospects for doing so appear narrow.\u00a0As a result, we now believe that Mr Trump is most likely to win November\u2019s presidential election.",
    "Our forecast change reflects the Democratic Party\u2019s weaknesses more than Mr Trump\u2019s strengths.\u00a0We previously believed\u00a0that Mr Biden was better positioned to win the election, based on the strength of the US economy, his clearer path to appealing to voters across the political spectrum and his long-standing fundraising lead.\u00a0However, these advantages have recently diminished, leaving Mr Trump with the upper hand.\u00a0Mr Biden\u2019s messaging on the country\u2019s strong economic fundamentals\u00a0has failed to register with voters who are still adjusting to a lengthy period of high inflation. His poor debate performance has fractured his base within the Democratic Party while sapping the confidence of independent and swing voters in his candidacy. Mr Trump has also closed his fundraising gap with Mr Biden, and could benefit further as large donors continue to question Mr Biden\u2019s electability.",
    "Some aspects of our election forecast remain unchanged.\u00a0We still expect the presidential election to be extremely close, and the risks to our new forecast of a Trump victory are again very high.\u00a0Mr Trump remains a highly controversial figure, and intense polarisation of the US electorate will prevent him from attracting a new swell of voter support. It also remains possible that Democrats will recover from their recent political fallout. With just under four months until Election Day, Mr Biden theoretically has enough time to restore confidence in his campaign, although a smooth Democratic nominating convention in August and strong performances in any future debates would be essential. Mr Biden could also choose to step aside, which could inject new excitement into the Democratic ticket, especially if it involves a candidate from a battleground state. However, the politics and logistics of manoeuvring such a late change would be challenging. The low popularity of Mr Biden\u2019s natural successor, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, poses additional complications.",
    "The next month will be an important test of each party\u2019s presidential ticket. The Republican National Convention takes place on July 15th-18th and has already resulted in the resounding nomination of Mr Trump as the party\u2019s official candidate. Mr Trump has also just announced his vice-presidential pick, the 39-year-old Ohio senator, JD Vance. Mr Vance\u2019s humble origins in the Midwest will appeal to Mr Trump\u2019s base and potentially have currency in some of the region\u2019s battleground states.\u00a0However, Mr Vance\u2019s limited political experience (he first took office in 2023), his populist leanings and his endorsement of Mr Trump\u2019s hardline policies could be a tough sell with moderates, independents, swing voters and the business community.",
    "Democrats will hold their own nominating convention on August 19th-22nd, and would benefit from uniting behind a single presidential candidate well beforehand.\u00a0Prolonged indecision or a potential \u201copen convention\u201d, whereby multiple candidates vie for the nomination if Mr Biden steps aside, would only divide the party further, leaving little time to mount a compelling campaign against Mr Trump and Mr Vance.",
