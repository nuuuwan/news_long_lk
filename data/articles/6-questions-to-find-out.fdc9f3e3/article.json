    "Do you know how your employees truly feel about their roles, work, and relationships? Asking the right questions in focused one-on-one settings is key to making sure you\u2019re in tune with your people. This article outlines six questions to try to move beyond...more",
    "Employee wellbeing is under serious strain. Roughly 60% of workers say they\u2019re struggling with engagement, and one in five report feeling lonely, according to Gallup. This is no small issue for managers: employees who aren\u2019t thriving are less productive, less committed, and more likely to have a negative effect on your company\u2019s bottom line.",
    "That\u2019s why you need to be aware of how your team is doing and be ready to step in if any issues arise. This takes a commitment to building trust and keeping communication open, says Emma Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, a faculty member at the Yale School of Management and author of Sovereign: Reclaim Your Freedom, Energy, and Power in a Time of Distraction, Uncertainty, and Chaos.",
    "\u201cMake sure your employees feel comfortable and safe with you,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they don\u2019t feel they can trust you or that you care, they won\u2019t be open to talking to you.\u201d",
    "Even with a strong rapport, it can be challenging to understand how your colleagues truly feel about their roles, work, and relationships \u2014 especially for your remote employees. Asking the right questions in focused one-on-one settings is key, says Steven Rogelberg, Chancellor\u2019s Professor at the University of North Carolina Charlotte and author of Glad We Met: The Art and Science of 1:1 Meetings.",
    "\u201cWhat we missed during the pandemic was connection and feeling seen by those critical to our success and careers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe missed having conversations that matter.\u201d",
    "To make sure you\u2019re in tune with your people, here are six questions our experts suggest to go beyond surface-level interactions.",
    "1. How are you showing up today on a scale of 1-10?",
    "The trouble with perfunctory questions like \u201cHow\u2019s life?\u201d is that they often lead to superficial responses like \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d But asking team members to rate their current state on a numerical scale invites a more deliberate form of self-assessment, says Rogelberg. This is particularly important for remote workers who may feel isolated and less connected. If someone ranks themselves a four, for instance, the follow-up question, \u201cWhat factors are contributing to that score?\u201d becomes a gateway to reflection and deeper understanding.",
    "\u201cMaybe someone is wrestling with a tough project or dealing with stuff at home,\u201d he says. \u201cAsking follow-up questions can help you learn things you might not find out otherwise.\u201d",
    "One word to the wise, however. Before launching into this conversation, set a tone of genuine concern and compassion, says Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. Make eye contact, use a warm voice, and signal that you\u2019re present. \u201cLet them know this conversation is for them and that you care for them as a human first, employee second.\u201d",
    "2. What\u2019s something you\u2019re excited about right now outside of work?",
    "This question might not reveal how your colleagues feel about their jobs, per se, but it does help you build personal connections by uncovering common interests and exploring differences. \u201cGetting to know your team members as people with lives outside of work takes time and trust,\u201d says Rogelberg. \u201cBut building this foundation is worthwhile because it makes it easier for people to talk about concerns later on.\u201d",
    "Stay within your colleague\u2019s comfort zone; if someone is hesitant to share, don\u2019t press. \u201cAs you gain their trust, they may feel more comfortable opening up,\u201d he says.",
    "Along with this question, Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 suggests trying to bridge the personal and professional by asking: \u201cWhat makes you come alive at work? And what are some things we\u2019re doing as an organization that energize you?\u201d Your goal is to find shared threads in what they enjoy and see how those can create opportunities for growth and engagement within the team.",
    "3. Do you derive meaning from your work? If not, what changes could help?",
    "Research shows that when employees have a sense of purpose and fulfillment at work, they experience greater job satisfaction and are more likely to stay with their organization. To get at this, Rogelberg suggests learning more about your colleagues\u2019 professional motivations. Ask: What parts of your job do you love? What do you dread? Has this role met your expectations? Have there been any surprises, good or bad? This is especially relevant for remote employees who may struggle with feelings of disconnection.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about asking; it\u2019s about showing that you want to support them and make their work more meaningful,\u201d he says.",
    "Active listening plays an important role here, says Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. Be curious and don\u2019t talk too much. \u201cWhen you do speak, echo back what the person has said in your own words. This way, they feel heard, and you can be sure you have properly interpreted what they are saying.\u201d",
    "4. What could make this job or organization more compelling for you in the long run?",
    "Understanding what drives your team members\u2019 motivation and commitment is critical, says Rogelberg. \u201cMotivation directly impacts engagement, satisfaction, and retention.\u201d The key is to be open to their ideas while being transparent about what\u2019s out of your hands or not feasible. For instance, if someone wants to work from home full-time but that\u2019s not an option, \u201cbe upfront about what you can influence.\u201d Avoid overpromising; instead, \u201ctry to get where they\u2019re coming from and brainstorm solutions together.\u201d",
    "Bear in mind that some feedback might be tough to hear. If an employee points out ways the work isn\u2019t running smoothly or highlights blind spots in your approach, it\u2019s natural to feel defensive, says Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. But \u201cavoid pushing back or interjecting.\u201d This meeting is about understanding their perspective, not justifying the status quo. \u201cUse this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cif you can\u2019t address everything, schedule a follow-up meeting.\u201d",
    "5. What makes you feel depleted or drains you at work and what can I do to support you?",
    "Your team members may be dealing with various challenges that you might not fully know about: a difficult assignment, complex team dynamics, or a subpar direct report. Identifying these roadblocks and concerns can help you provide the right support, says Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. The goal is to find out, \u201cwhat could help make it easier for them to perform at their best, and whether there is anything you can do to facilitate that.\u201d",
    "Rogelberg suggests probing about tasks they feel are a waste of time or whether they need clarification on expectations. Be careful not to come across as micromanaging, though; otherwise, you risk damaging your relationship and hurting their productivity. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to leave the conversation feeling like you\u2019re trying to dictate every detail of their work.\u201d",
    "6. What are your career goals and dreams? What can I do to help you move towards them?",
    "Many managers never bother to ask their employees about their long-term professional aspirations, and that\u2019s a missed opportunity. The more you recognize your team members as people with ambitions and dreams \u2014 not just cogs in the machine \u2014 the better you\u2019ll understand how they feel about their jobs and futures.",
    "To move beyond routine check-ins, Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 suggests starting with: \u201cI know we usually talk about business only, but today I want to ask about your professional goals. My objective is to ensure I am helping you move towards them and to see if there\u2019s any way I can help.\u201d",
    "Remember, it\u2019s not just about collecting information; it\u2019s about using what you learn to support their development. Whether you suggest targeted training, stretch assignments, or opportunities to showcase their skills, your aim is to show that you\u2019re invested in their growth.",
    "There isn\u2019t a universal approach to these conversations, experts say. It\u2019s important to choose questions that resonate with you and your colleagues, considering the dynamics of your relationships. Experiment with different questions to find your rhythm and what feels right.",
    "Ultimately, it\u2019s not just about the questions you ask; it\u2019s about \u201cyour sincerity and genuine interest in their answers,\u201d says Rogelberg. \u201cThis means listening attentively, delving into what they share, and offering support whenever possible.\u201d",
