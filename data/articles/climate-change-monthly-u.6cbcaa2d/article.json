    "Chinese carbon price reaches new record high",
    "China\u2019s emission trading scheme (ETS) is gaining momentum, with prices in April and May rising above Rmb100/tonne (US$13.8/tonne) for the first time since it came online three years ago. Regulators are tightening compliance so that firms that fail to meet the emission allowance will be subject to much heavier fines, according to new rules that came into effect in May 2024.\u00a0EIU expects China\u2019s regulators to continue refining the country\u2019s ETS in 2024-25, in order to create a functioning market that encourages emissions reductions.",
    "Emissions trading schemes, which create a carbon price by requiring certain high-emissions industries to purchase allowances proportional to their emissions, have been adopted in over a dozen countries worldwide. Most schemes start with a \u201clearning by doing\u201d period, when regulators need to periodically evaluate the supply and demand of emission permits, and allow the market to discover the prices that will incentivise emissions reductions. This process can take years: the first two phases of the EU ETS (2005-12), for instance, were characterised by an oversupply of emission permits, which left carbon prices too low to incentivise emission reductions until the system was reformed and allowances cut.",
    "In 2024-25 we expect China\u2019s ETS to tighten allowance allocations and expand to cover more sectors, increasing trading volumes. The scheme currently covers only the power sector but is likely to expand to include the steel, cement and aluminium sectors. These reforms are unlikely to restrict allowances sufficiently to cut emissions, but will serve to educate the market, start a gradual rise in the price of allowances and force overcapacity sectors to consolidate.\u00a0For example, in the steel and cement sectors, the reforms will heighten the operational costs of the least efficient firms and may force them out of the market.",
    "Expectations of a tightening market have already boosted China\u2019s carbon prices. As the system matures, we also expect Chinese regulators to initiate dialogue with their counterparts in the EU, where the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM, a carbon tariff system on EU imports) comes into effect in 2026.",
    "US takes a first step towards better governance of carbon markets",
    "On May 28th the administration of US president Joe Biden issued guidelines setting out how it would seek to regulate voluntary carbon markets. Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), which try to match carbon abatement projects with funders, are growing rapidly as more companies adopt net-zero targets. These projects often take the form of so-called \u2018nature based solutions\u2019 such as setting aside protected ecosystems, or reforestation. However, assessing how much carbon is removed by these projects can be difficult, with high risks of false assumptions or double-counting. Several recent reports have found that most voluntary carbon offset projects made little to no difference in the overall level of greenhouse gas emissions in the relevant project regions.",
    "Despite the controversy over VCMs, the Biden administration (along with most climate modellers) view VCMs as a way to incentivise projects that will create negative emissions, until solutions can be scaled to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors. The guidance reflects this, highlighting the need for corporate net-zero strategies to focus on emissions cuts, as well as the need for some offsets.",
    "However, the guidance remains vague, and does not set out a strong role for the public sector in setting or enforcing these standards other simply than highlighting the need to include more robust carbon accounting in financial disclosures.\u00a0If Mr Biden wins a second term as president, as we expect, these guidelines will likely form the basis for more specific regulation of VCMs.\u00a0If Donald Trump wins (not our core forecast), they will likely be scrapped altogether.",
    "Physical risk watch: Flooding in Brazil",
    "Many of the regions that experienced significant stress in April saw those impacts continue into May.\u00a0Flooding in east Africa, particularly Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Burundi\u00a0continued and intensified.\u00a0Droughts in southern Africa and Central and South America\u00a0expanded, with\u00a0Costa Rica\u00a0joining Colombia and Ecuador in rationing water.\u00a0Prolonged dry weather in Canada\u00a0has also led to an early start to its wildfire season, undermining hydropower generation and forcing it to become a net electricity importer from the US.",
    "The most acute climate disaster was\u00a0severe flooding in Brazil, which started in late April and persisted through the first half of May. The flooding led to more than 150 deaths and caused damage across many cities in the Rio Grande do Sul state, which accounts for roughly 9.5% of the Brazilian economy with officials estimating at least US$2bn in damages. The state governor declared a state of calamity at the height of the crisis, encompassing 88% of the population. Damage to cities and agricultural land will weigh on Brazil\u2019s GDP this year, while the initial costs of clean-up efforts at about US$10bn will widen the country\u2019s fiscal deficit. Both the immediate cleanup activities, and the larger environmental priorities of Brazilian president Lula de Silva are likely to increase in prominence as a result of the catastrophe.",
    "In the coming months, the El Ni\u00f1o atmospheric phenomenon that has led to an increase in global temperatures is likely to give way to the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. Although this is likely to lead to cooler weather overall, its impact will not be fully felt before summer in the northern hemisphere, keeping the risks of more extreme weather events during the coming months elevated.",
    "Looking forward: Will European elections stall climate action?",
    "We expect that the next European Parliament election, concluding on June 9th, will change the composition of the European Parliament.\u00a0Far-right parties, which are generally the most sceptical towards ambitious environmental and climate policies, are\u00a0expected to increase\u00a0their seat share, with the biggest losers being green parties.\u00a0The centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP) is likely to remain the largest single parliamentary group but may need to work with far-right parties, particularly the European Conservatives and Reformist (ECR) parliamentary group, to obtain a majority.",
    "The ECR bloc\u2019s views on climate change reflect its constituent parties\u2019 views: Few right-wing parties deny the existence of climate change outright, but instead don\u2019t prioritise action to reduce overall emissions over imposing costs on households or established sectors of the economy. For example, far-right parties, when they have gone into or supported governing coalitions in EU member states:",
    "generally oppose green initiatives that place costs on consumers such as increases in fuel taxes and requirements to retrofit homes.",
    "have generally aligned with agricultural interests that oppose the transition to more sustainable farming techniques or changing land use (which have led to protests in several European countries).",
    "have generally been sceptical of enshrining sectoral emissions targets into law, or empowering regulatory or judicial bodies to take climate change considerations into account in their rulemaking and arbitration processes",
    "generally have not attempted to roll back existing climate laws or incentives unless they are new or highly unpopular",
    "As a result, we expect that the next European Parliament is unlikely to push forward ambitious EU-wide initiatives on climate change.\u00a0Even in advance of the election, the EU\u00a0was moving away from green initiatives which were proving unpopular. The EU scrapped a proposed nature restoration directive, which would require member states to make efforts to improve 20% of their land area\u2019s biodiversity by 2030. The energy transition is likely to continue apace, but this will largely be driven by implementing the existing 2023 EU energy directive, which requires 42.5% of all electricity to be produced by renewable sources by 2030. Any further support for renewables is likely to be justified on the grounds of energy security rather than climate change. Existing green trade provisions, including the CBAM and deforestation-linked bans on palm and soy oil, are likely to be retained, but here again, we expect that the EU will justify these on more protectionist grounds, rather than solely due to climate change.",
