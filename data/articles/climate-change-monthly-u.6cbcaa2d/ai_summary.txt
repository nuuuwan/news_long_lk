Opinions:

- EIU expects China to refine its ETS over the next year to develop a functioning market that encourages emissions reductions.
- Biden's May guidelines are vague and avoid detailing a strong role for the public sector in setting or enforcing carbon standards.
- The European Parliament is unlikely to instigate ambitious EU-wide initiatives on climate change.
- The growth in far-right parties will likely stagnate progress on environmental and climate policies in the European Parliament.
- The EU is already moving away from unpopular green initiatives, having scrapped a proposed nature restoration directive.
- Further support for renewables is likely to be justified by energy security motives, rather than climate change, following the upcoming election.
