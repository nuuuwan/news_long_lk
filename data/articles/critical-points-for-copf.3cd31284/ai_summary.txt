1. 📜  The proposed Economic Transformation Bill in Sri Lanka might not deliver consistent, sustainable growth or increase disposable incomes for citizens. 

2. 📌Critiques suggest that a mix of reforms is needed for inclusive growth, including political stability, policy consistency,ease of doing business, and good governance.

3. 🇮🇳 🇨🇳 Effective supply chain linkages on India and China, and possibly extending to include options with the Asian Tigers could also be a key strategy.

4. 🚶‍♂️ Sri Lankan citizens are impacted by high cost of living, hunger, malnutrition and lack of opportunities for human development.

5. 💼 The Bill aims to reduce national debt and help Sri Lanka enter international credit markets, but whether it will ensure welfare and wellbeing of citizens and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals is questionable.

6. 📋The proposed Bill could negatively impact current businesses registered under the BOI and could lead to externally raised compensation claims under investment protection treaty rights.

7. 🤔A key question is whether the five new public institutions proposed by the bill could be avoided through restructuring, change management, and use of existing institutions.

8. 💡Several additions are suggested to the bill, including adding certain requirements under the preamble, ensuring long term economic policy framework implemented by the executive, and promoting human development among others.

9. ❗The bill could also be improved by introducing a clause where regulations have to be tabled in Parliament for review, expanding oversight control of Parliament, and ensuring all appointments associated with the bill must be governed by a Code of Ethics.

10. 🎓The bill should also include criteria related to human resources development, knowledge, skills and values, and promote environmental sustainability.
