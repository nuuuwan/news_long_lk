    "OpenAI has released a new image generator that\u2019s designed less for typical surrealist AI art and more for highly controllable and practical creation of visuals\u2014a sign that OpenAI thinks its tools are ready for use in fields like advertising and graphic design.\u00a0 The image generator, which is now part of the company\u2019s GPT-4o model, was promised by OpenAI last May but wasn\u2019t released. Requests for generated images on ChatGPT were filled by an older image generator called DALL-E. OpenAI has been tweaking the new model since then and will now release it over the coming weeks to all tiers of users starting today, replacing the older one.\u00a0  The new model makes progress on technical issues that have plagued AI image generators for years. While most have been great at creating fantastical images or realistic deepfakes, they\u2019ve been terrible at something called binding, which refers to the ability to identify certain objects correctly and put them in their proper place (like a sign that says \u201chot dogs\u201d properly placed above a food cart, not somewhere else in the image).\u00a0 It was only a few years ago that models started to succeed at things like \u201cPut the red cube on top of the blue cube,\u201d a feature that is essential for any creative professional use of AI. Generators also struggle with text generation, typically creating distorted jumbles of letter shapes that look more like captchas than readable text.",
    "OPENAI   Example images from OpenAI show progress here. The model is able to generate 12 discrete graphics within a single image\u2014like a cat emoji or a lightning bolt\u2014and place them in proper order. Another shows four cocktails accompanied by recipe cards with accurate, legible text. More images show comic strips with text bubbles, mock advertisements, and instructional diagrams. The model also allows you to upload images to be modified, and it will be available in the video generator Sora as well as in GPT-4o.\u00a0  OPENAI   OPENAI   OPENAI     OPENAI   OPENAI     It\u2019s \u201ca new tool for communication,\u201d says Gabe Goh, the lead designer on the generator at OpenAI. Kenji Hata, a researcher at OpenAI who also worked on the tool, puts it a different way: \u201cI think the whole idea is that we\u2019re going away from, like, beautiful art.\u201d It can still do that, he clarifies, but it will do more useful things too. \u201cYou can actually make images work for you,\u201d he says, \u201cand not just just look at them.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s a clear sign that OpenAI is positioning the tool to be used more by creative professionals: think graphic designers, ad agencies, social media managers, or illustrators. But in entering this domain, OpenAI has two paths, both difficult.\u00a0 One, it can target the skilled professionals who have long used programs like Adobe Photoshop, which is also investing heavily in AI tools that can fill images with generative AI.\u00a0 Related StoryOpenAI has released its first research into how using ChatGPT affects people\u2019s emotional well-beingWe\u2019re starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us\u2014but there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know.",
    "\u201cAdobe really has a stranglehold on this market, and they\u2019re moving fast enough that I don\u2019t know how compelling it is for people to switch,\u201d says David Raskino, the cofounder and chief technical officer of Irreverent Labs, which works on AI video generation.\u00a0 The second option is to target casual designers who have flocked to tools like Canva (which has also been investing in AI). This is an audience that may not have ever needed technically demanding software like Photoshop but would use more casual design tools to create visuals. To succeed here, OpenAI would have to lure people away from platforms built for design in hopes that the speed and quality of its own image generator would make the switch worth it (at least for part of the design process).\u00a0 It\u2019s also possible the tool will simply be used as many image generators are now: to create quick visuals that are \u201cgood enough\u201d to accompany social media posts. But with OpenAI planning massive investments, including participation in the $500 billion Stargate project to build new data centers at unprecedented scale, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the image generator won\u2019t play some ambitious moneymaking role.\u00a0 Regardless, the fact that OpenAI\u2019s new image generator has pushed through notable technical hurdles has raised the bar for other AI companies. Clearing those hurdles likely required lots of very specific data, Raskino says, like millions of images in which text is properly displayed at lots of different angles and orientations. Now competing image generators will have to match those achievements to keep up. \u201cThe pace of innovation should increase here,\u201d Raskino says. hide"
