The Sri Lankan Ministry of Finance has announced a plan to reform State Owned Banks (SOBs) following significant stress caused by an economic crisis. These banks' lending practices have deteriorated due to inadequate risk mitigation and weak governance, this has led to delays in reforms which have contributed to the economic crisis. The SOBs balance sheets have been loaded with income from lending to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), limiting their ability to lend to productive sectors of the economy. Despite their financial struggles, the SOBs claim to have met their profit targets. Proposed solutions include hiring reputable directors, stronger monitoring, and assessing the banks in light of their principal objectives. The re-capitalization of the SOBs will also play a key part in the reform plan.
