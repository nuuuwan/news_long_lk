A commemoration event called “Turning Point” was recently organised by a civil society collective at the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to remember the loss of life at the end of the three-decade war. A wide range of groups, including the Dharmashakthi Organisation, the Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES), the Young Men’s Buddhist Association (YMBA), Sangha for a Better Sri Lanka (SBSL) and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), were involved in organising the event. It was attended by people of all ethnicities and religions, as well as religious clergy and politicians. However, the National Peace Council criticised the government for increasing the presence of security forces in the north and east of the country and for arresting and harassing those who wish to mark May 18 or that week as a period of sorrow. The council called on the government to allow commemoration of losses in line with the Reparations Act, stating there could be no reconciliation without justice.
