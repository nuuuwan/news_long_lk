    "Remembering the dead on May 18 at Mullivaikkal",
    "The joint commemoration event titled \u201cTurning Point\u201d held on May 17 at the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo was in memory of the loss of life that took place 15 years ago at the end of the war of people from all sides.\u00a0 It is an indication that the wounds of the three-decade war are beginning to heal.\u00a0 The event was organised by a civil society collective consisting of inter-religious groups, different NGOs and Diaspora groups.",
    "The National Peace Council appreciates the leadership role played by the Dharmashakthi Organisation, the Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES), the Young Men\u2019s Buddhist Association (YMBA), Sangha for a Better Sri Lanka (SBSL) and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF). Those at the evening open-air event were persons of all ethnicities and religions, religious clergy and politicians. The images shown at the event and the words spoken represented a common concern for all life, including security services personnel lost during the war.",
    "Unfortunately, the continued polarization on the issue of memorialization is to be seen in the way in which May 18 is commemorated in the North and the East of the country as a day of sorrow, while May 19 is commemorated by the government as Victory Day and promotions are given to members of the security forces. The presence of security forces has been strengthened prior to the commemorations scheduled to take place in the North and the East, as it has been ever since the war ended.",
    "The National Peace Council condemns the arrest and harassment of those who wish to mark May 18 or that week as a period of sorrow owing to the loss of civilian life, which are also Sri Lankans whoever they may be, in the last battles of the war. The path to national reconciliation is not for members of the security forces to drag men and women away at night from their homes and arrest them as happened last week in the East for trying to commemorate their loved ones.",
    "Reconciliation process",
    "There can be no reconciliation process if there is no justice.\u00a0 Those who wish to commemorate have a right to do so.\u00a0 The Reparation Act provides for it. Section 27 of the Reparations Act states that \u201ccollective reparations mean, such measures as are intended to recognize the right to an effective remedy and benefits to the communities or groups of aggrieved persons and shall include (a) means of remembrance of deceased persons, including memorials\u2026\u201d If there is to be reconciliation, it is incumbent on the government to uphold the law and observe the example that civil society organisations provide in commemorating all who lost their lives and replicate it on a macro-scale.",
    "The National Peace Council is an independent and non partisan organization that works towards a negotiated political solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. It has a vision of a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka in which the freedom, human rights and democratic rights of all the communities are respected. The policy of the National Peace Council is determined by its Governing Council of 20 members who are drawn from diverse walks of life and belong to all the main ethnic and religious communities in the country."
