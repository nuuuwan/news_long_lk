In recent decades, women’s labor force participation has leveled off, men and women remain concentrated into different occupations, and women continue to shoulder significantly more housework and childcare than men. This slow — even stagnant — pace of change is a key finding from the new 2024 Women in the Workplace 10th anniversary report by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Company. The report highlights that there’s been even less progress when it comes to women’s lived experiences in the workplace. And most concerningly, there have been almost no improvements across generations. In fact, not only are the experiences of women under 30 similar to those of women 50 and older — in some ways, they’re worse. Companies must do more to address the distinct obstacles that stall women’s progress early in their careers. The authors present some troubling findings from the research, as well as specific actions companies can take to better support the next generation of women leaders.

Last year, for the first time in two decades, the gender wage gap widened, with men’s median earnings rising 3% while women’s grew only 1.5%. This backsliding surprised some, in part because it defies widely held beliefs in the U.S. that social progress unfolds automatically and steadily over time. Such conventional wisdom holds that each successive generation will become more egalitarian and enjoy more opportunities than the last. According to this view, reaching gender equality is “inevitable”; it just takes time.
