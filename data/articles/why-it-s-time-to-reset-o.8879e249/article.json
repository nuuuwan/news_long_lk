    "Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me. Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It\u2019s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).  At the same time I can't help feeling a little bit: Is that it? If you feel the same way, there\u2019s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!",

Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for. That\u2019s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it\u2019s time to re-set our expectations.",
    "As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package\u2019s intro essay, \u201cYou can\u2019t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what\u2019s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?\u201d\u00a0 Elsewhere in the package, James O\u2019Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for. Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.\u00a0 Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.  Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate. Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdAn industry I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI.Let\u2019s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don\u2019t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn\u2019t going anywhere. We shouldn't be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven\u2019t come true\u2014yet. The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we\u2019re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.\u00a0 Let\u2019s all catch our breath, shall we? This story first appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly free newsletter all about AI.
