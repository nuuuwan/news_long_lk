Palestinian protesters in Ramallah marked the 76th anniversary of ‘Nakba’ or ‘Catastrophe’, which led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948. The anniversary comes amid renewed violence, which has forced more displacement over the past week, particularly in Rafah. The events of Nakba began after UN General Assembly Resolution 181 allowed Israel to declare itself an independent state. Critics claim Western nations, including the US and UK, are complicit in this ongoing suffering for failing to uphold peace and justice, with suggestions that the United Nations is structured to preserve US hegemony and imperialistic interests.
