    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake",
    "The much anticipated Presidential election next month has created seismic activity in and out of the political arena. While the candidates are focused on winning, those in the periphery, the cohorts and the plutocrats are in a dilemma. The biggest joke is that for most of the sitting Members of Parliament and other politicians it does not matter whether Ranil wins or Sajith wins. Among their selfish and opportunistic agendas, the formidable challenge is to make sure that Anura does not come to power.",
    "It clearly explains why members of opposing camps are shaking hands in unity and support either with Ranil or Sajith for the upcoming Presidential election. There is no surprise here that the one who spoke against corruption shaking hands with the corrupt. The one who pledged to establish the rule of law on the same platform with those who grossly violated the law. The one who promised to prosecute murderers, criminals and drug traffickers in cohorts with the same ilk. The one who stood against racism hugging the racist. Those who shouted \u2018banku hora\u2019 (bank robber) campaigning shoulder to shoulder with the \u2018robber\u2019. This resonates well with Ranjan Ramanayake\u2019s clich\u00e9, \u201cEgollo okkoma yahaluwo\u201d (all of them are friends).",
    "The title to this column has deliberately omitted an important name \u2013 the Rajapaksas. Well, the general view of the public is that President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a dual role epitomises both himself and the Rajapaksas. Even Dr. Jekyll may feel jealous about this novel role on the duplicity of human nature that he played in the strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.",
    "The elite shenanigans",
    "Citizen Perera in his usual state of confusion is not aware of the ultimate goal of the burgeoning solidarity between the bourgeoisies but remains baffled either in his innocence or ignorance. He only asks the question, \u201cis this about winning elections by hook or by crook?\u201d which also means coming to power by whatever means. Even if it means sleeping with the devil in the ninth circle of hell (meaning; something that couldn\u2019t get worse \u2013 In Dante\u2019s, \u2018Inferno\u2019).",
    "The elitists who consider themselves as the movers and shakers of the political circle are not prepared to part with the cake to the lesser mortals. Someone wrote: \u201cWe have refined the subtleties of class distinctions so that accents, tastes, clothes, possessions, hobbies, and many other factors can immediately identify the position in society of our fellow citizens.\u201d In the society of wealth, individualism, status and aristocracy Anura and his set of proletariat comrades in red T-shirts are simply a non-entity.",
    "Another sub-category is the nouveau riche, the parvenus who rose from the lower class and who had been continuously interacting with the elite. They evolved to dilute the class distinction and now ride the wave of the elites.",
    "In Social Dominance Theory \u2018behavioural asymmetry\u2019 is referred to power imbalances in social interactions. Literally, it states, those with more power can shape norms, control resources, and influence outcomes. Under the veneer of this otherness there is a sense of superiority on the side of the elite class sociologically, politically and economically. This perception, sadly, is readily acknowledged by the not elite class, in the form of their submissive demeanour.",
    "In most of the elite, the feeling of being a superior class gives them the aura of impunity in matters involving the less fortunate folks. This behavioural asymmetry can be seen in a feudal set up. A destitute village damsel who had been abused may not have recourse to the law if she becomes a victim of an aristocrat\u2019s hedonist son. When the girl\u2019s father goes to the aristocrat to complain and seek justice, he would be treated with contempt, scorned and dismissed. \u201cHow dare you questions us? Who are you to question my son\u2019s conduct?\u201d",
    "In the fiefdom of Sri Lankan politics where hypocrisy, corruption, nepotism, impunity and servility reigns amongst the elite ruling class something serious is bothering them. The growing popularity of Anura\u2019s candidature is challenging this political culture. He is a threat to the disproportionate control by the elite minority of the majority working class, the peasantry and lumpen proletariat (the extremely poor and unemployed). Anura the village guy who was hawking in the train for a living is likely to play the role of the village damsel\u2019s father. In the elitists\u2019 mind, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d",
    "Anura\u2019s campaign inter alia has gained momentum by creating awareness and educating the public on good governance. From this, flows addressing of corruption and seeking accountability for various types of abuse of power, etc. A major plus is positioning himself as a proponent of transparent administration free from conflict of interests between family members, friends and henchmen. He has delegitimised the myth of \u2018Rule by the Elite\u2019 culture by exposing deceptive politics and emphasising on media responsibility towards the masses. Making a clear separation between politics and religion in a country where religions have caused mayhem is worthy of mention. Of course, also laying out various macro level policy statements and, so on.",
    "The reality that Anura may succeed in becoming the next President has triggered the primordial fears within the elite class. Primal fears are deep rooted and inborn feelings in every human mind. The genesis of the fear is founded in the misdoings, impropriety and shenanigans of most of our politicians, bureaucrats and the wealthy. Disgracefully, some belonging to the so called \u2018elite\u2019 class. Others, like the nouveau riche, who have worked themselves up to \u2018ride that wave of elitism\u2019. Both are blameworthy and are answerable to the people for their political and financial juggleries.",
    "Primordial fear in the ancient times was on the desire for survival thus fearing predators, darkness, heights and death. Though the elements of fear of the past have changed the desire for survival continues to exist in the human psyche even today. Today such fears translate into fears of another form. Fear of darkness those days is reflected in the unknown of today \u2013 \u201cwhat will happen?\u201d The fear of falling from heights in the past can be seen in fear of the fall from the impunity enjoyed. The instinctual love for survival as free as one wants will be hindered by the dangerous possibility of being prosecuted and the prospect of serving jail sentence.",
    "Besides addressing issues of the macro and micro economic problems faced by the nation, there has to be a parallel effort in some of the following areas also.",
    "1. to ensure that corruption is brought down to the bare minimum level",
    "2. to establish the rule of law without fear or favour",
    "3. prosecute the corrupt by revisiting all the previous cases which were filed and dismissed due to legal technicalities arising from improper and ineffective investigations",
    "4. prosecute all those who directly or indirectly contributed to bankrupt this country",
    "5. prosecute all those who have been acting with impunity for their crimes",
    "6. prosecute all those who acted in abuse of the power and authority vested in them",
    "7. clean up the Police and grant them independence in the enforcement of the law free from political influence",
    "8. clean up the bureaucracy that is rotting",
    "This is not an exhaustive list but would certainly help in turning around this nation to a decent habitable place on earth.",
