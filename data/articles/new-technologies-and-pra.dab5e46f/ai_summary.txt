💡 Renewable energy faces challenges like intermittency, variability, cost, and integration but continues to innovate. 
🍃 Green fuels such as hydrogen, methane, ammonia and ethanol can be stored and used for various applications; Sri Lanka has potential for these. 
☀️ A new type of solar cell using material called perovskite is being explored with high absorption and conversion efficiency.
🌊 Floating solar farms are being erected on lakes and reservoirs, saving land space.
💨 Offshore wind farms, installed in the sea, exploit wind corridors and have the potential of 56 GW in Sri Lanka.
🌀 Designers have created vertical-axis wind turbines that capture wind from any direction and operate at low speeds, suitable for urban areas.
🇪🇸 Bladeless wind turbines are being developed by a Spanish startup, Vortex Bladeless, which uses an elastic rod to produce energy from vibration.
🌬️ Traditional wind turbine capacity has increased to 20MW, significantly larger than most, including  Sri Lanka's 4MW wind turbines.
🤖 Big data and AI are being used for quick decision-making in energy grids, optimising power consumption forecasting and predictive maintenance.
🔋 The concept of Distributed Energy Storage Systems is gaining prominence, producing localised power and storage.
🌊 Start-ups are working on harnessing sea and ocean waves for energy. 
🌽 Bioenergy is increasingly derived from biomass sources, with companies now producing bio-oil from genetically modified algae.
