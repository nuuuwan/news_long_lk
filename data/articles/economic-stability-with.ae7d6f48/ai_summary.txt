The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been criticised for focusing on the affluent when recommending stabilisation measures for bankrupt economies. The accusations were made by a lecturer at Murdoch University's business school who claimed the IMF was more interested in maintaining the stability of capitalism and its finances. To this end, it recommended the increase of indirect taxes, such as VAT, which tended to affect the poor and working classes. It also called for state-owned enterprises to be made more profitable and, the writer claimed, for these to be privatised. For Sri Lanka to escape its economy woes, the writer added, it had to undertake reforms. These included addressing the more than $58bn of debt it needs to repay once its restructuring negotiations were concluded.
