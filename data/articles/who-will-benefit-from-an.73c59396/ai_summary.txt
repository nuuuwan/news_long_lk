Predicting the outcome of the upcoming Presidential election in Sri Lanka is challenging due to the country's current economic crisis and widespread public dissatisfaction with both current and former rulers. Several factors have influenced the political climate, including economic difficulties and widespread protests. This environment has led to significant decreases in support for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which traditionally had strong popular backing.

In contrast to other groups, Tamils in the North have been largely unswayed by the shift in political sentiment, remaining focused on ethnic issues and past grievances. As a result, they are considering rejecting all Sinhalese and south-based candidates in the election. Differences of opinion remain on how to implement this, with some advocating for a Tamil common candidate and others pushing for a boycott of the election.

The Tamil National Peopleâ€™s Front supports a boycott, arguing this would pressure the government to address the ethnic problem. Other groups advocate for a Tamil common candidate to force Sinhalese candidates to consider their political agenda. However, the main Tamil party, Ilangai Tamil Arasu Katchi, has not endorsed either approach, leading to possible confusion among Tamil voters. Offers to stand as a common candidate have been made by prominent political figures such as CV Wigneswaran, MP and former Chief Minister of Northern Province.

Whatever the Tamil leaders decide, a significant reduction in Sinhalese votes is expected, either through boycott or the voting for a Tamil candidate. A boycott would decrease the number of votes need for a presidential win due to constitutional requirements, while a Tamil candidate would place a greater burden on the other candidates to secure a majority. These political developments further complicate the prediction of the results of the Presidential election.
