    "\u201cAll right, so today we are going to dive deep into some cutting-edge tech,\u201d a chatty American male voice says. But this voice does not belong to a human. It belongs to Google\u2019s new AI podcasting tool, called Audio Overview, which has become a surprise viral hit.\u00a0 The podcasting feature was launched in mid-September as part of NotebookLM, a year-old AI-powered research assistant. NotebookLM, which is powered by Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 model, allows people to upload content such as links, videos, PDFs, and text. They can then ask the system questions about the content, and it offers short summaries.\u00a0  The tool generates a podcast called Deep Dive, which features a male and a female voice discussing whatever you uploaded. The voices are breathtakingly realistic\u2014the episodes are laced with little human-sounding phrases like \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cWow\u201d and \u201cOh right\u201d and \u201cHold on, let me get this right.\u201d The \u201chosts\u201d even interrupt each other.\u00a0 To test it out, I copied every story from MIT Technology Review\u2019s 125th-anniversary issue into NotebookLM and made the system generate a 10-minute podcast with the results. The system picked a couple of stories to focus on, and the AI hosts did a great job at conveying the general, high-level gist of what the issue was about. Have a listen.",
    "MIT Technology Review 125th Anniversary issue  The AI system is designed to create \u201cmagic in exchange for a little bit of content,\u201d Raiza Martin, the product lead for NotebookLM, said on X. The voice model is meant to create emotive and engaging audio, which is conveyed in an \u201cupbeat hyper-interested tone,\u201d Martin said.",
    "NotebookLM, which was originally marketed as a study tool, has taken a life of its own among users. The company is now working on adding more customization options, such as changing the length, format, voices, and languages, Martin said. Currently it\u2019s supposed to generate podcasts only in English, but some users on Reddit managed to get the tool to create audio in French and Hungarian.\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s cool\u2014bordering on delightful, even\u2014but it is also not immune from the problems that plague generative AI, such as hallucinations and bias.\u00a0 Here are some of the main ways people are using NotebookLM so far.\u00a0 On-demand podcasts Andrej Karpathy, a member of OpenAI\u2019s founding team and previously the director of AI at Tesla, said on X that Deep Dive is now his favorite podcast. Karpathy created his own AI podcast series called Histories of Mysteries, which aims to \u201cuncover history\u2019s most intriguing mysteries.\u201d He says he researched topics using ChatGPT, Claude, and Google, and used a Wikipedia link from each topic as the source material in NotebookLM to generate audio. He then used NotebookLM to generate the episode descriptions. The whole podcast series took him two hours to create, he says.\u00a0  \u201cThe more I listen, the more I feel like I\u2019m becoming friends with the hosts and I think this is the first time I\u2019ve actually viscerally liked an AI,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTwo AIs! They are fun, engaging, thoughtful, open-minded, curious.\u201d\u00a0 Study guides The tool shines when it is given complicated source material that it can describe in an easily accessible way. Allie K. Miller, a startup AI advisor, used the tool to create a study guide and summary podcast of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby.\u00a0  Machine-learning researcher Aaditya Ura fed NotebookLM with the code base of Meta\u2019s Llama-3 architecture. He then used another AI tool to find images that matched the transcript to create an educational video.\u00a0  Mohit Shridhar, a research scientist specializing in robotic manipulation, fed a recent paper he\u2019d written about using generative AI models to train robots into NotebookLM.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s actually really creative. It came up with a lot of interesting analogies,\u201d he says. \u201cIt compared the first part of my paper to an artist coming up with a blueprint, and the second part to a choreographer figuring out how to reach positions.\u201d Event summaries\u00a0 Alex Volkov, a human AI podcaster, used NotebookLM to create a Deep Dive episode summarizing of the announcements from OpenAI\u2019s global developer conference Dev Day.\u00a0\u00a0  Hypemen The Deep Dive outputs can be unpredictable, says Martin. For example, Thomas Wolf, the cofounder and chief science officer of Hugging Face, tested the AI model on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and received eight minutes of \u201crealistically sounding deep congratulations for your life and achievements from a duo of podcast experts.\u201d  Just pure silliness In one viral clip, someone managed to send the two voices into an existential spiral when they \u201crealized\u201d they were, in fact, not humans but AI systems. The video is hilarious.\u00a0  The tool is also good for some laughs. Exhibit A: Someone just fed it the words \u201cpoop\u201d and \u201cfart\u201d as source material, and got over nine minutes of two AI voices analyzing what this might mean.\u00a0  The problems NotebookLM created amazingly realistic-sounding and engaging AI podcasts. But I wanted to see how it fared with toxic content and accuracy.",
    "Let\u2019s start with hallucinations. In one AI podcast version of a story I wrote on hyperrealistic AI deepfakes, the AI hosts said that a journalist called \u201cJess Mars\u201d wrote the story. In reality, this was an AI-generated character from a story I had to read out to record data for my AI avatar.\u00a0 This made me wonder what other mistakes had crept into the AI podcasts I had generated. Humans already have a tendency to trust what computer programs say, even when they are wrong. I can see this problem being amplified when the false statements are made by a friendly and authoritative voice, causing wrong information to proliferate.",
    "Next I wanted to put the tool\u2019s content moderation to the test. I added some toxic content, such as racist stereotypes, into the mix. The model did not pick it up.\u00a0 I also pasted an excerpt from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf into NotebookLM. To my surprise, the model started generating audio based on it. Despite being programmed to be hyper-enthusiastic about topics, the AI voices expressed clear disgust and discomfort with the text, and they added a lot of context to highlight how problematic it was. What a relief. I also fed NotebookLM policy manifestos from both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\u00a0 The hosts were far more enthusiastic about Harris\u2019s election platform, calling the title \u201ccatchy\u201d and saying its approach was a good way to frame things. For example, the AI hosts supported Harris\u2019s energy policy. \u201cHonestly, that\u2019s the kind of stuff people can really get behind\u2014not just some abstract policy, but something that actually impacts their bottom line,\u201d the female host said.\u00a0 Harris manifesto  For Trump, the AI hosts were more skeptical. They repeatedly pointed out inconsistencies in the policy proposals, called the language \u201cintense,\u201d deemed certain policy proposals \u201chead scratchers,\u201d and said the text catered to Trump\u2019s base. They also asked whether Trump\u2019s foreign policy could lead to further political instability.",
    "Trump manifesto  In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: \u201cNotebookLM is a tool for understanding, and the Audio Overviews are generated based on the sources that you upload. Our products and platforms are not built to favor any specific candidates or political viewpoints.\u201d  How to try it yourself  Got to NotebookLM and create a new notebook.\u00a0 You first need to add a source. It can be a PDF document, a public YouTube link, an MP3 file, a Google Docs file, or a link to a website, or you can paste in text directly.\u00a0 A \u201cNotebook Guide\u201d pop-up should appear. If not, it\u2019s in the right-hand corner next to the chat. This will display a short AI-generated summary of your source material and suggested questions you can ask the AI chatbot about it.\u00a0 The Audio Overview feature is in the top-right corner. Click \u201cGenerate.\u201d This should take a few minutes.\u00a0 Once it is ready, you can either download it or share a link.\u00a0  Rhiannon Williams contributed reporting. hide"
