- 🇱🇰 The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party is splitting from Ranil Wickremesinghe.
- 🔀 This decision has seen 11 SLPP MPs leave the party and join the UNP, backing Wickremesinghe’s presidency.
- 👥 The split comes as the SLPP plans to present a separate candidate for the presidential election.
- 💭 The move has raised questions regarding Wickremesinghe’s electoral chances in light of the split.
- ⚖️ It is argued that Wickremesinghe may be better off without an endorsement from the Rajapaksas, leaders of the SLPP.

- 🧾 This has allowed Wickremesinghe to claim credit for the country’s economic recovery.
- 👥 Wickremesinghe’s split from the Rajapaksas could aid him in building a more diverse political coalition.
