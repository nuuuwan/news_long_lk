Staying proactive and informed is crucial for finance leaders to successfully navigate rapidly changing business environments. This includes managing diverse, hybrid teams across time zones and continents and adapting to the record high inflation rates that affect business costs. Today's companies are reassessing their approach to sustainability and ESG issues, and financial performance is now interconnected with sustainability. Therefore, finance leaders and their teams should continue to advise on sustainable business practices, data analysis, and regulatory reporting. As a CFO, one must not only be a financial expert but also be knowledgeable about emerging technology trends, ESG and sustainability initiatives, societal changes that spur business advancements, and managing diverse, multi-generational teams.
