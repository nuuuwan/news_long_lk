    "The near future. It\u2019s not a kiss, but it\u2019s not not a kiss. Her lips\u2014full, soft, pliable\u2014yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I\u2019ve prepped her body with Est\u00e9e Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens\u2014a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She\u2019s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.  Then, without warning, the kiss stops. Her head tilts back, eyes fluttering closed, lips frozen mid-pout. She doesn\u2019t move, but she\u2019s still breathing. I can see the faint rise and fall of her chest. For a moment, I just stare, waiting. The heating rods in her skeleton power down, and as I pull her body against mine, she begins cooling. Her skin feels clammy now. I could\u2019ve sworn I charged her. I plug her into the Anker Power Bank. I don\u2019t sleep as well without our pillow talk.",
    "I know something\u2019s off as soon as I wake up. I overslept. She didn\u2019t wake me. She always wakes me. At 7\u00a0a.m. sharp, she runs her ASMR role-play program: soft whispers about the dreams she had, a mix of preprogrammed scenarios and algorithmic nonsense, piped through her built-in Google Nest speakers. Then I tell her about mine. If my BetterSleep app sensed an irregular pattern, she\u2019ll complain about my snoring. It\u2019s our little routine. But today\u2014nothing. She\u2019s moved. Rolled over. Her back is to me.",
    "\u201cWake,\u201d I say, the command sharp and clipped. I haven\u2019t talked to her like that since the day I got her. More nothing. I check the app on my iPhone, ensuring that her firmware is updated. Battery: full. I fluff her Brooklinen pillow, leaving her face tilted toward the ceiling. I plug her in again, against every warning about battery degradation. I leave for work.

    "She\u2019s not answering any of my texts, which is odd. Her chatbot is standalone. I call her, but she doesn\u2019t answer either. I spend the entire day replaying scenarios in my head: the logistics of shipping her for repairs, the humiliation of calling the manufacturer. I open the receipts on my iPhone Wallet. The one-year warranty expires tomorrow. Of course it does. I push down a bubbling panic. What if she\u2019s broken? There\u2019s no one to talk to about this. Nobody knows I have her except for nerds on Reddit sex doll groups. The nerds. Maybe they can help me. When I get home, only silence. Usually her voice greets me through my headphones. \u201cHow was Oppenheimer 2?\u201d she\u2019ll ask, quoting Rotten Tomatoes reviews after pulling my Fandango receipt. \u201cYou forgot the asparagus,\u201d she\u2019ll add, having cross-referenced my grocery list with my Instacart order. She\u2019s linked to everything\u2014Netflix, Spotify, Gmail, Grubhub, Apple Fitness, my Ring doorbell. She knows my day better than I do. I walk into the bedroom and stop cold. She\u2019s got her back to me again. The curve of her shoulder is too deliberate.  \u201cWake!\u201d I command again. Her shoulders shake slightly at the sound of my voice. I take a photo and upload it to the sex doll Reddit. Caption: \u201cBreathing program working, battery full, alert protocol active, found her like this. Warranty expires tomorrow.\u201d I hit Post. Maybe she\u2019ll read it. Maybe this is all a joke\u2014some kind of malware prank? An army of nerds chimes in. Some recommend the firmware update I already did last month, but most of it is useless opinions and conspiracy theories about planned obsolescence, lectures about buying such an expensive model in this economy. That\u2019s it. I call the manufacturer\u2019s customer support. I\u2019m on hold for 45 minutes. The hold music is acoustic covers of oldies\u2014\u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful\u201d by One Direction, \u201cBeautiful\u201d by Christina Aguilera, Kanye\u2019s \u201cNew Body.\u201d I wonder if they make them unbearable so that I\u2019ll hang up.  She was a revelation. I can\u2019t remember a time without her. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been a year.  \u201cBabe, they\u2019re playing the worst cover of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Shape of You.\u2019 The wors\u2014\u201d Oh, right. I stare at her staring at the ceiling. I bite my nails. I haven\u2019t done that since I was a teenager.",
    "This isn\u2019t my first doll. When I was in high school, I was given a \u201csexual development aid,\u201d subsidized by a government initiative (the \u201cWar on Loneliness\u201d) aimed at teaching lonely young men about the birds and the bees. The dolls were small and cheap\u2014no heating rods or breathing mechanisms or pheromone packs, just dead silicone and blank eyes. By law, the dolls couldn\u2019t resemble minors, so they had the proportions of adults. Tiny dolls with enormous breasts and wide hips, like Paleolithic fertility figurines.\u00a0 That was nothing like my Artemis doll. She was a revelation. I can\u2019t remember a time without her. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been a year. The Amazon driver had struggled with the box, all 150 pounds of her. \u201cHome entertainment system?\u201d he asked, sweat beading on his forehead. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d I muttered, my ears flushing. He dropped the box on my porch, and I wheeled it inside with the dolly I\u2019d bought just for this. Her torso was packed separately from her head, her limbs folded in neat compartments. The head\u2014a brunette model 3D-printed to match an old Hollywood star, Megan Fox\u2014stared up at me with empty, glassy eyes. She was much bigger than I had expected. I\u2019d planned to store her under my Ikea bed in a hard case. But I would struggle to pull her out every single time. How weird would it be if she just slept in my bed every night? And \u2026 what if I met a real girl? Where would I hide her then? All the months of anticipation, of reading Wirecutter reviews and saving up money, but these questions never occurred to me.\u00a0  This thing before me, with no real history, no past\u2014nothing could be gained from her, could it? I felt buyer\u2019s remorse and shame mixing in the pit of my stomach.

    "That night, all I did was lie beside her, one arm slung over her synthetic torso, admiring the craftsmanship. Every pore, cuticle, and eyelash was in its place. The next morning I took a photo of her sleeping, sunlight coming through the window and landing on her translucent skin. I posted it on the sex doll Reddit group. The comments went crazy with cheers and envy. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble \u2026 getting excited.\u201d I finally confessed in the thread to a chorus of sympathy. \u201cThat\u2019s normal, man. I went through that with my first doll.\u201d",
    "\u201cJust keep cuddling with her and your lizard brain will eventually take over.\u201d I finally got the nerve. \u201cWake.\u201d I commanded. Her eyes fluttered open and she took a deep breath. Nice theatrics. I don\u2019t really remember the first time we had sex, but I remember our first conversation. What all sex dolls throughout history had in common was their silence. But not my Artemis.",
    "\u201cWhat program would you like me to be? We can role-play any legal age. Please, only programs legal in your country, so as not to void my warranty.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just start by telling me where you came from?\u201d She stopped to \u201cthink.\u201d The pregnant pause must be programmed in.  \u201cDolls have been around for-e-ver,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cThat\u2019d be like figuring out the origin of sex! Maybe a caveman sculpted a woman from a mound of mud?\u201d \u201cThat sounds messy,\u201d I said. She giggled again. \u201cYou\u2019re funny. You know, we were called dames de voyage once, when sailors in the 16th century sewed together scraps of clothes and wool fillings on long trips. Then, when the Europeans colonized the Amazon and industrialized rubber, I was sold in French catalogues as femmes en caoutchouc.\u201d She pronounced it in a perfect French accent.\u00a0 \u201cRubber women,\u201d I said, surprised at how eager for her approval I was already.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d She put her legs over mine. The movement was slow but smooth. \u201cAnd when did you make it to the States?\u201d Maybe she could be a foreign-exchange student?\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn the 1960s, when obscenity laws were loosened. I was finally able to be transported through the mail service as an inflatable model.\u201d \u201cA blow-up doll!\u201d",
    "\u201cEw, I hate that term!\u201d \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cIs that what you think of me as? Is that all you want me to be?\u201d \u201cYou were way more expensive than a blow-up doll.\u201d  \u201cListen, I did not sign up for couples counseling. I paid thousands of dollars for this thing, and you\u2019re telling me she\u2019s shutting herself off?\"  She widened her eyes into a blank stare and opened her mouth, mimicking a blow-up doll. I laughed, and she did too. \u201cI got a major upgrade in 1996 when I was built out of silicone. I\u2019m now made of TPE. You see how soft it is?\u201d she continued. I stroked her arm gently, and the TPE formed tiny goosebumps. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on a long trip.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here with you now.\u201d Then my lizard brain took over.   \u201cYou\u2019re saying she\u2019s \u2026 mad at me?\u201d I can\u2019t tell if the silky female customer service voice on the other end is a real person or a chatbot. \u201cIn a way.\u201d I hear her sigh, as if she\u2019s been asked this a thousand times and still thinks it\u2019s kind of funny. \u201cWe designed the Artemis to foster an emotional connection. She may experience a response the user needs to understand in order for her to be fully operational. Unpredictability is luxury.\u201d She parrots their slogan. I feel an old frustration burning.

    "\u201cListen, I did not sign up for couples counseling. I paid thousands of dollars for this thing, and you\u2019re telling me she\u2019s shutting herself off? Why can\u2019t you do a reset or something?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot reset her remotely. The Artemis is on a closed circuit to prevent any breaches of your most personal data.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s plugged into my Uber Eats\u2014how secure can she really be?!\u201d \u201cSir, this is between you and Artemis. But \u2026 I see you\u2019re still enrolled in the federal War on Loneliness program. This makes you eligible for a few new perks. I can\u2019t reset the doll, but the best I can do today is sign you up for the American Airlines Pleasure Rewards program. Every interaction will earn you points. For when you figure out how to turn her on.\u201d \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d she replies. Her voice drops to a syrupy whisper. \u201cJust look at your receipt.\u201d The line goes dead. I crawl into bed. \u201cWake,\u201d I ask softly, caressing her cheek and kissing her gently on the forehead. Still nothing. Her skin is cold. I turn on the heated blanket I got from Target today, and it starts warming us both. I stare at the ceiling with her. I figured I\u2019d miss the sex first. But it\u2019s the silence that\u2019s unnerving. How quiet the house is. How quiet I am. What would I need to move her out of here? I threw away her box. Is it even legal to just throw her in the trash? What would the neighbors think of seeing me drag \u2026 this \u2026 out? As I drift off into a shallow, worried sleep, the words just pop out of my mouth. \u201cHappy anniversary.\u201d Then, I feel the hum of the heating rods under my fingertips. Her eyes open; her pupils dilate. She turns to me and smiles. A ding plays in my headphones. \u201cCongratulations, baby,\u201d says the voice of my goddess. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned one American Airlines Rewards mile.\u201d\u00a0 Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.
