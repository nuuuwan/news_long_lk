    "In the decade-long fight to control CRISPR, the super-tool for modifying DNA, it\u2019s been common for lawyers to try to overturn patents held by competitors by pointing out errors or inconsistencies. But now, in a surprise twist, the team that earned the Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing CRISPR is asking to cancel two of their own seminal patents, MIT Technology Review has learned. The decision could affect who gets to collect the lucrative licensing fees on using the technology.  \u00ad\u00adThe request to withdraw the pair of European patents, by lawyers for Nobelists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, comes after a damaging August opinion from a European technical appeals board, which ruled that the duo\u2019s earliest patent filing didn\u2019t explain CRISPR well enough for other scientists to use it and doesn\u2019t count as a proper invention. The Nobel laureates\u2019 lawyers say the decision is so wrong and unfair that they have no choice but to preemptively cancel their patents, a scorched-earth tactic whose aim is to prevent the unfavorable legal finding from being recorded as the reason.",
    "\u201cThey are trying to avoid the decision by running away from it,\u201d says Christoph Then, founder of Testbiotech, a German nonprofit that is among those opposing the patents, who provided a copy of the technical opinion and response letter to MIT Technology Review. \u201cWe think these are some of the earliest patents and the basis of their licenses.\u201d Discovery of the century CRISPR has been called the biggest biotech discovery of the century, and the battle to control its commercial applications\u2014such as gene-altered plants, modified mice, and new medical treatments\u2014has raged for a decade.",

    "The dispute primarily pits Charpentier and Doudna, who were honored with the Nobel Prize in 2020 for developing the method of genome editing, against Feng Zhang, a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, who claimed to have invented the tool first on his own. Back in 2014, the Broad Institute carried out a coup de main when it managed to win, and later defend, the controlling US patent on CRISPR\u2019s main uses. But the Nobel pair could, and often did, point to their European patents as bright points in their fight. In 2017, the University of California, Berkeley, where Doudna works, touted its first European patent as exciting, \u201cbroad,\u201d and \u201cprecedent\u201d setting. After all, a region representing more than 30 countries had not only recognized the pair\u2019s pioneering discovery; it had set a standard for other patent offices around the world. It also made the US Patent Office look like an outlier whose decisions favoring the Broad Institute might not hold up long term. A further appeal challenging the US decisions is pending in federal court. Long-running saga But now the European Patent Office is also saying\u2014for different reasons\u2014that Doudna and Charpentier can\u2019t claim their basic invention. And that\u2019s a finding their attorneys think is so damaging, and reached in such an unjust way, that they have no choice but to sacrifice their own patents. \u201cThe Patentees cannot be expected to expose the Nobel-prize winning invention \u2026 to the repercussions of a decision handed down under such circumstances,\u201d says the 76-page letter sent by German attorneys on their behalf on September 20.  The chief intellectual-property attorney at the University of California, Randi Jenkins, confirmed the plan to revoke the two patents but downplayed their importance.\u00a0 \u201cThese two European patents are just another chapter in this long-running saga involving CRISPR-Cas9,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWe will continue pursuing claims in Europe, and we expect those ongoing claims to have meaningful breadth and depth of coverage.\u201d The patents being voluntarily disavowed are EP2800811, granted in 2017, and EP3401400, granted in 2019. Jenkins added the Nobelists still share one issued CRISPR patent in Europe, EP3597749, and one that is pending. That tally doesn\u2019t include a thicket of patent claims covering more recent research from Doudna\u2019s Berkeley lab that were filed separately. Freedom to operate The cancellation of the European patents will affect a broad network of biotech companies that have bought and sold rights as they seek to achieve either commercial exclusivity to new medical treatments or what\u2019s called \u201cfreedom to operate\u201d\u2014the right to pursue gene-slicing research unmolested by doubts over who really owns the technique.",
    "These companies include Editas Medicine, allied with the Broad Institute; Caribou Biosciences and Intellia Therapeutics in the US, both cofounded by Doudna; and Charpentier\u2019s companies, CRISPR Therapeutics and ERS Genomics. ERS Genomics, which is based in Dublin and calls itself \u201cthe CRISPR licensing company,\u201d was set up in Europe specifically to collect fees from others using CRISPR. It claims to have sold nonexclusive access to its \u201cfoundational patents\u201d to more than 150 companies, universities, and organizations who use CRISPR in their labs, manufacturing, or research products. For example, earlier this year Laura Koivusalo, founder of a small Finnish biotech company, StemSight, agreed to a \u201cstandard fee\u201d because her company is researching an eye treatment using stem cells that were previously edited using CRISPR. Although not every biotech company thinks it\u2019s necessary to pay for patent rights long before it even has a product to sell, Koivusalo decided it would be the right thing to do. \u201cThe reason we got the license was the Nordic mentality of being super honest. We asked them if we needed a license to do research, and they said yes, we did,\u201d she says.  A slide deck from ERS available online lists the fee for small startups like hers at $15,000 a year. Koivusalo says she agreed to buy a license to the same two patents that are now being canceled. She adds: \u201cI was not aware they were revoked. I would have expected them to give a heads-up.\u201d\u00a0 A spokesperson for ERS Genomics said its customers still have coverage in Europe based on the Nobelists\u2019 remaining CRISPR patent and pending application.

    "In the US, the Broad Institute has also been selling licenses to use CRISPR. And the fees can get big if there\u2019s an actual product involved. That was the case last year, when Vertex Pharmaceuticals won approval to sell the first CRISPR-based treatment, for sickle-cell disease. To acquire rights under the Broad Institute\u2019s CRISPR patents, Vertex agreed to pay $50 million on the barrelhead\u2014and millions more in the future. PAM problem There\u2019s no doubt that Charpentier and Doudna were first to publish, in a 2012 paper, how CRISPR can function as a \u201cprogrammable\u201d means of editing DNA. And their patents in Europe withstood an initial round of formal oppositions filed by lawyers.",
    "But this August, in a separate analysis, a technical body decided that Berkeley had omitted a key detail from its earliest patent application, making it so that \u201cthe skilled person could not carry out the claimed method,\u201d according to the finding. That is, it said, the invention wasn\u2019t fully described or enabled. The omission relates to a feature of DNA molecules called \u201cprotospacer adjacent motifs,\u201d or PAMs. These features, a bit like runway landing lights, determine at what general locations in a genome the CRISPR gene scissors are able to land and make cuts, and where they can\u2019t. In the 76-page reply letter sent by lawyers for the Nobelists, they argue there wasn\u2019t really any need to mention these sites, which they say were so obvious that \u201ceven undergraduate students\u201d would have known they were needed.\u00a0 The lengthy letter leaves no doubt the Nobel team feels they\u2019ve been wronged. In addition to disavowing the patents, the text runs on because it seeks to \u201cmake of public record the reasons for which we strongly disagree with [the] assessment on all points\u201d and to \u201cclearly show the incorrectness\u201d of the decision, which, they say, \u201cfails to recognize the nature and origin of the invention, misinterprets the common general knowledge, and additionally applies incorrect legal standards.\u201d hide"
