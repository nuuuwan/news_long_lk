    "To tackle complex global problems such as preventing disease and mitigating climate change, we\u2019re going to need new ideas from our brightest minds. Every year, MIT Technology Review identifies a new class of Innovators Under 35 taking on these and other challenges.\u00a0 On September 10, we will honor the 2024 class of Innovators Under 35. These 35 researchers and entrepreneurs are rising stars in their fields pursuing ambitious projects: One is unraveling the mysteries of how our immune system works, while another is engineering microbes to someday replace chemical pesticides.  Each is doing groundbreaking work to advance one of five areas: materials science, biotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, or climate and energy. Some have found clever ways to integrate these disciplines. One innovator, for example, enlists tiny robots to reduce the amount of antibiotics required to treat infections.

    "MIT Technology Review has published its Innovators Under 35 list since 1999. The first edition was created for our 100th anniversary and was meant to give readers a glimpse into the future, by highlighting what some of the world\u2019s most talented young scientists are working on today. This year, we\u2019re celebrating our 125th anniversary and honoring this 25th class of innovators with the same goal in mind. (Note: The 2024 list will be made available exclusively to subscribers. If you\u2019re not a subscriber, you can sign up here.)Keep an eye on The Download newsletter next week for our announcement of the new class. You can also meet some of them at EmTech MIT, which will take place on September 30 and October 1 on MIT\u2019s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. If you can\u2019t wait until then, we\u2019ll reveal our Innovator of the Year during a live broadcast on LinkedIn on Monday, September 9. This person stood out for using their ingenuity to address a power imbalance in the tech sector (and that\u2019s the only hint you get). They\u2019ll join me on screen to talk about their work and share what\u2019s next for their research. hide"
