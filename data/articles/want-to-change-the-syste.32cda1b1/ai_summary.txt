Facts:

- Sri Lanka is preparing for another Presidential election.
- The author argues that a 'system' is composed of elements, interconnections, and purpose, with purpose being the key determinant of a system's behaviour.
- Changing the purpose of a system could lead to significant changes in the system, even if all elements and interconnections remain the same.
- The expectation is that leaders should bring about system change but changing the leader alone, without changing the connections and purpose, does not necessarily change the system.
- Succeeding at system change requires conscious efforts by everyone partaking in a system and this cannot be accomplished overnight.
- A change in the purpose means changing the outcome and actions that the nation desires.

Opinions:

- The author believes that replacing every person in parliament will not cause a system change unless the interconnections and the purpose are also altered.
- The author questions whether the purpose of the Sri Lankan government is clear, deduced from the actions of the national leaders.
- The author criticises the view that education is merely about gaining a university certificate, suggesting that it involves deep and rational thinking about the country`s purpose and democratic participation.
- The author implies that voters should scrutinize the prospective policies of political candidates and their practicality rather than voting based on empty slogans.
- It is recommended that voters understand how a potential leader could facilitate the vision of the nation in practical steps rather than falling for "flashy words".
