    "The UK\u2019s Office of National Statistics has an online life expectancy calculator. Enter your age and sex, and the website will, using national averages, spit out the age at which you can expect to pop your clogs. For me, that figure is coming out at 88 years old. That\u2019s not too bad, I figure, given that globally, life expectancy is around 73. But I\u2019m also aware that this is a lowball figure for many in the longevity movement, which has surged in recent years. When I interview a scientist, doctor, or investor in the field, I always like to ask about personal goals. I\u2019ve heard all sorts. Some have told me they want an extra decade of healthy life. Many want to get to 120, close to the current known limit of human age. Others have told me they want to stick around until they\u2019re 200. And some have told me they don\u2019t want to put a number on it; they just want to live for as long as they possibly can\u2014potentially indefinitely.  How far can they go? This is a good time to ask the question. The longevity scene is having a moment, thanks to a combination of scientific advances, public interest, and an unprecedented level of investment. A few key areas of research suggest that we might be able to push human life spans further, and potentially reverse at least some signs of aging. Take, for example, the concept of cellular reprogramming. Nobel Prize\u2013winning research has shown it is possible to return adult cells to a \u201cyounger\u201d state more like that of a stem cell. Billions of dollars have been poured into trying to transform this discovery into a therapy that could wind back the age of a person\u2019s cells and tissues, potentially restoring some elements of youth.",
    "Related StoryThe quest to legitimize longevity medicineLongevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there\u2019s a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.",
    "Many other avenues are being explored, including a diabetes drug that could have broad health benefits; drugs based on a potential anti-aging compound discovered in the soil of Rapa Nui (Easter Island); attempts to rejuvenate the immune system; gene therapies designed to boost muscle or extend the number of times our cells can divide; and many, many more. Other researchers are pursuing ways to clear out the aged, worn-out cells in our bodies. These senescent cells appear to pump out chemicals that harm the surrounding tissues. Around eight years ago, scientists found that mice cleared of senescent cells lived 25% longer than untreated ones. They also had healthier hearts and took much longer to develop age-related diseases like cancer and cataracts. They even looked younger. Unfortunately, human trials of senolytics\u2014drugs that target senescent cells\u2014haven\u2019t been quite as successful. Unity Biotechnology, a company cofounded by leading researchers in the field, tested such a drug in people with osteoarthritis. In 2020, the company officially abandoned that drug after it was found to be no better than a placebo in treating the condition.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t one day figure out how to treat age-related diseases, or even aging itself, by targeting senescent cells. But it does illustrate how complicated the biology of aging is. Researchers can\u2019t even agree on what the exact mechanisms of aging are and which they should be targeting. Debates continue to rage over how long it\u2019s possible for humans to live\u2014and whether there is a limit at all. Still, we are getting better at testing potential therapies in more humanlike models. We\u2019re finding new and improved ways to measure the aging process itself. The X Prize is offering $101 million to researchers who find a way to restore at least 10 years of \u201cmuscle, cognitive, and immune function\u201d in 65- to 80-year-olds with a treatment that takes one year or less to administer. Given that the competition runs for seven years, it\u2019s a tall order; Jamie Justice, executive director of the X Prize\u2019s health-span domain, told me she initially fought back on the challenging goal and told the organization\u2019s founder, Peter Diamandis, there was \u201cno way\u201d researchers could achieve it. But we\u2019ve seen stranger things in science.\u00a0 Some people are banking on this kind of progress. Not just the billionaires who have already spent millions of dollars and a significant chunk of their time on strategies that might help them defy aging, but also the people who have opted for cryopreservation. There are hundreds of bodies in storage\u2014bodies of people who believed they might one day be reanimated. For them, the hopes are slim. I asked Justice whether she thought they stood a chance at a second life. \u201cHonest answer?\u201d she said. \u201cNo.\u201d It looks likely that something will be developed in the coming decades that will help us live longer, in better health. Not an elixir for eternal life, but perhaps something\u2014or a few somethings\u2014that can help us stave off some of the age-related diseases that tend to kill a lot of us. Such therapies may well push life expectancy up. I don\u2019t feel we need a massive increase, but perhaps I\u2019ll feel differently when I\u2019m approaching 88. The ONS website gives me a one in four chance of making it to 96, and a one in 10 chance of seeing my 100th birthday. To me, that sounds like an impressive number\u2014as long as I get there in semi-decent health. I\u2019d still be a long way from the current record of 122 years. But it might just be that there are some limitations we must simply come to terms with\u2014as individuals and in society at large. In a 2017 paper making the case for a limit to the human life span, scientists Jan Vijg and Eric Le Bourg wrote something that has stuck with me\u2014and is worth bearing in mind when considering the future of human longevity: \u201cA species does not need to live for eternity to thrive.\u201d\u00a0 hide"
