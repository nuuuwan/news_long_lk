    "Some lives leave behind not just memories but legacies that inspire generations to come",
    "On 24 January 2025, the Sri Lankan accounting fraternity was profoundly saddened to learn of the passing of Samy M. Pasupati, a distinguished member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), whose vital contributions helped shape the strong foundation instituted by our founding fathers.",
    "This article serves as a tribute to the late Pasupati, reflecting on his remarkable life that stands as a shining testament to unwavering professionalism, selfless service, and an enduring commitment to making a difference in the lives of others.",
    "As one of the first 131 members to be enrolled in the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka in 1961, Pasupati was a pioneer in the field of accountancy. His journey was not merely a professional one, but it was a mission to elevate the profession in Sri Lanka while contributing to the nation\u2019s development. His achievements as a Chartered Accountant reflect a unique lifetime of dedication to excellence, humility, and the power of service.",
    "A visionary in the world of taxation",
    "Pasupati\u2019s career was a beacon of excellence. His tenure as the senior partner of Satchithananda, Schokman, and Pasupati, and later as a partner at Coopers and Lybrand, helped shape the accountancy and taxation landscape in Sri Lanka.",
    "A visionary in the field of taxation, Pasupati served on the Presidential Commission on Taxation and was also a member of the GST compliance team, where he played a pivotal role in implementing the Government\u2019s tax reform package. He facilitated and managed change, addressed client and public educational needs, and developed strategies and representation as required. His perseverance and dedication allowed him to specialise in all facets of taxation, quickly emerging as an authority on tax policy and legislation, both domestically and internationally. With a unique ability to comprehend and interpret the complexities of tax codes across multiple countries, he also conducted a detailed study of double taxation treaties.",
    "Reflecting on his impact, CA Sri Lanka President Heshana Kuruppu said, \u201cThe passing of Mr. Pasupati will leave an indelible mark on our profession and the Institute. Since 1961, Mr. Pasupati has served the Institute and the profession with distinction, holding numerous positions, including that of a Council Member, during which time he also chaired several committees.\u201d",
    "\u201cMr. Pasupati was more than an accountant; he was a visionary who helped shape the very fabric of our profession in Sri Lanka. His knowledge and passion were unmatched, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.\u201d",
    "Apart from serving as a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, his dedication to the profession was equally evident in his service to CA Sri Lanka, where he chaired key committees, including the Taxation Committee and the Committee on Company Law and Legislation. He was also a member of the Accounting Standards, Examinations and Professional Conduct Committees.",
    "In recognition of his pioneering achievements, Pasupati was among the first inductees into the prestigious CA Sri Lanka Hall of Fame in 2011\u2014a fitting tribute to a man who became a role model for generations of Chartered Accountants.",
    "A champion of excellence",
    "Pasupati\u2019s commitment to progress extended far beyond his profession. He championed higher education reforms through his work with the University of Kelaniya and the University of Jaffna. He was also an active member of the Board of Management at the Postgraduate Institute of Management.",
    "He was hailed in the corporate sector for his inspiring and progressive leadership, having served as a director at top organisations, including the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka, Carson Cumberbatch, and Hatton National Bank.",
    "His dedication to community service was equally profound, having held the positions of President of the Lions (Host) Club, District Cabinet Treasurer, and Zonal Chairman of Lions International. These roles stood as a shining example of selflessness and compassion.",
    "Even after moving to Australia, Pasupati\u2019s commitment to community service remained unwavering. Whether in Sri Lanka or Australia, his passion for uplifting communities and promoting social and religious causes knew no boundaries, inspiring countless others to follow his lead.",
    "Deva Rodrigo, a Chartered Accountant who served as the Territory Senior Partner of PwC Sri Lanka and Maldives from 1992 to 2006 and had the privilege of working closely with the late Pasupati, fondly described him as a brilliant mind who was widely regarded as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost accountants. \u201cI had the honour of working with him at Coopers and Lybrand. In all my years, I never heard anyone speak ill of him. Mr. Pasupati was one of the longest-serving members of CA Sri Lanka at the time of his passing, holding membership number 7.\u201d",
    "Speaking further, Rodrigo explained that the late Pasupati\u2019s community work, especially in Australia, was highly praised, and he was widely respected as the undisputed leader of the Tamil community.",
    "\u201cWhen he was in Sri Lanka, he was a recognised specialist in tax matters, to the point that even the Inland Revenue Department held him in high esteem. His expertise was so valued that when new tax legislation was being drafted, he was consulted for his invaluable insights.\u201d",
    "As we honour Pasupati\u2019s extraordinary life, we are reminded of the values he embodied: professionalism, dedication, humility, and service, showcasing that one life can truly make a difference."
