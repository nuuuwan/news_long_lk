Battery swapping technology could alleviate range anxiety and long charging times for electric vehicles (EVs), attracting more consumers to EV adoption. However, implementation has proven difficult, as demonstrated by Tesla and Better Place's past failures. In contrast, Chinese company Nio has successfully implemented battery swapping through 2,300 stations across the country. When planning long distances, EV users must plan their routes carefully to ensure they can stop at available charging stations, a problem that battery swapping could solve. The Chinese success in this area provides valuable lessons for companies elsewhere.
