    "Taken together, Trump\u2019s record is a patchwork of genuine progress, unfinished proposals, and exaggerated claims",
    "The hostility between Israel and Iran has defined Middle Eastern geopolitics for decades. During his current presidency, Trump has claimed credit for preventing escalation and presenting this as proof of averting war. Yet Iran\u2019s nuclear program has advanced and Israel\u2019s security posture remains unchanged. His intervention appears more a pause in tensions than a resolution \u2014 not the durable peace that Nobel history rewards",
    "Examining his eight claimed peace deals and the Russia\u2013Ukraine war",
    "The Nobel Peace Prize has long symbolised the world\u2019s highest recognition of human effort to replace conflict with cooperation. From Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk\u2019s reconciliation in South Africa to Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s role in ending the Cold War, the Prize has celebrated transformative achievements that reshaped international relations. It has also, at times, sparked controversy \u2014 as when President Barack Obama received the award in 2009 at the very beginning of his presidency, largely for his promise rather than performance.",
    "More than a decade later, the same debate has resurfaced around President Donald Trump, who has claimed to have brought \u201csix wars to an end in six months\u201d and, at other times, \u201cseven unendable wars\u201d to a close. Some of his supporters extend this narrative to \u201ceight in eight,\u201d portraying him as a global peacemaker whose unconventional diplomacy halted or eased major confrontations. Trump himself has repeatedly asserted that he could \u201cend the Russia\u2013Ukraine war in 24 hours.\u201d",
    "This article examines that claim of peacemaking through evidence rather than rhetoric. It analyses eight conflicts that Trump says he helped resolve \u2014 including Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan, Israel\u2013Iran, and the ongoing Gaza crisis \u2014 alongside his approach to the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. The objective is not to dismiss his diplomatic ventures, but to critically assess whether they represent genuine, lasting peace or merely political performance wrapped in bold self-promotion.",
    "Israel\u2013Iran: De-escalation or durable peace?",
    "The hostility between Israel and Iran has defined Middle Eastern geopolitics for decades. During his current presidency, Trump has claimed credit for preventing escalation and presenting this as proof of averting war. Yet Iran\u2019s nuclear program has advanced and Israel\u2019s security posture remains unchanged. His intervention appears more a pause in tensions than a resolution \u2014 not the durable peace that Nobel history rewards.",
    "Rwanda\u2013DRC: Peripheral role in a chronic crisis",
    "The conflict in eastern Congo \u2014 the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) \u2014 has dragged on for almost thirty years. It began after the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when armed groups fled across the border into Congo and started fighting for control of land and rich mineral resources such as gold and cobalt. Since then, local militias and rebel groups, some linked to Rwanda, have kept the region unstable, displacing millions of people and causing immense human suffering. The Trump administration claimed credit for mediating a 2025 dialogue between Rwanda and Congo, but fighting in the area has continued, and peace remains out of reach.",
    "Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan: A real breakthrough",
    "By contrast, the US-brokered agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan in August 2025 stands as Trump\u2019s strongest achievement. The deal halted fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh and created humanitarian access. The White House hailed it as ending a \u201c100-year war.\u201d While fragile, this remains the clearest case of tangible peacemaking under Trump\u2019s leadership. If any single initiative strengthens his Nobel claim, it is this one.",
    "Thailand\u2013Cambodia: A modest gesture",
    "Border clashes around the Preah Vihear temple have flared repeatedly. In 2025, Trump\u2019s administration claimed credit for helping secure a truce. Yet ASEAN had been active, and both governments had already signalled readiness to step back. The truce reduced violence, but no structural settlement was reached. This was a modest diplomatic gesture, not a historic breakthrough.",
    "India\u2013Pakistan: A disputed mediation",
    "The long-running dispute between India and Pakistan centres on the divided region of Kashmir, claimed by both countries since their independence in 1947. Over the years, the two nuclear-armed neighbours have fought wars, exchanged artillery fire across the Line of Control, and accused each other of supporting cross-border terrorism. President Trump has said that he helped calm \u201cOperation Senthoor,\u201d a Pakistani military build-up that could have led to confrontation. However, India firmly rejects any outside involvement in Kashmir, while Pakistan acknowledges only informal US discussions. Although border tensions eased briefly, there was no formal peace process, making Trump\u2019s claim of mediation difficult to verify.",
    "Egypt\u2013Ethiopia: The Nile Dam stalemate",
    "The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia revolves around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a massive hydro-power project built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile River. Ethiopia sees the dam as essential for development and electricity generation, while Egypt fears it could reduce the water flow on which millions of its people depend. President Trump has said that his engagement helped prevent the two countries from going to war. Although tensions did ease, no binding agreement on water sharing has been reached, and negotiations continue under the African Union\u2019s supervision. Trump\u2019s involvement may have helped cool tempers, but the core dispute remains unresolved.",
    "Serbia\u2013Kosovo: Symbolism without substance",
    "The conflict between Serbia and Kosovo dates back to the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade still refuses to recognise it, and tensions often flare in the Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo. President Trump helped broker the Washington Agreement in 2020, which aimed to improve economic relations between the two sides, and later encouraged further talks during his current presidency. While the effort brought short-term goodwill and global attention, it did not lead to Serbia\u2019s recognition of Kosovo or lasting peace. The European Union has since taken over most of the mediation, leaving Trump\u2019s initiative more symbolic than substantive",
    "Gaza 20-point plan: A work in progress",
    "The Gaza war has devastated the enclave since 2023. Trump\u2019s 20-point plan, unveiled recently, is one of his boldest proposals: combining hostages-for-truce swaps, reconstruction aid, and security guarantees for Israel. Initially rejected outright, the plan has since seen Hamas show tentative interest in some provisions. It remains unratified, but it is evolving. If it gains traction, it could become a significant element of Trump\u2019s legacy. For now, it is a vision rather than an achievement.",
    "Russia\u2013Ukraine: A promise without delivery",
    "The Russia\u2013Ukraine war is the world\u2019s most consequential conflict. Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end it \u201cin 24 hours,\u201d citing his rapport with both Putin and Zelensky. His administration floated land-swap and neutrality ideas in 2025, but they never matured into negotiations and were rejected in Kyiv. The war continues unabated. At this point, Trump\u2019s claim remains rhetoric without delivery.",
    "A patchwork of claims and realities",
    "Taken together, Trump\u2019s record is a patchwork of genuine progress, unfinished proposals, and exaggerated claims. The Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan agreement represents a real achievement. The Gaza plan remains in flux and could, if successful, significantly shift the picture. But cases like Rwanda\u2013DRC, Thailand\u2013Cambodia, and India\u2013Pakistan suggest marginal or disputed US roles. Russia\u2013Ukraine remains unresolved.",
    "Nobel prizes are awarded not for ambition or temporary pauses, but for durable and transformative achievements. Jimmy Carter was honoured for a lifetime of mediation, the Oslo Accords for creating a framework of coexistence, and the Good Friday Agreement for bringing peace to Northern Ireland. By comparison, Trump\u2019s interventions produce headlines more often than history.",
    "Supporters of Trump often point to the example of President Barack Obama, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 only months into his first term. At that time, Obama had not resolved any conflict. The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him the prize for \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\u201d and for inspiring global hope after the Bush years. The decision was controversial even among Obama\u2019s allies, as it rewarded aspiration rather than accomplishment.",
    "By that precedent, some argue, Trump\u2019s case appears stronger: whatever their fragility, his record includes tangible agreements, such as the Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan deal, the Abraham Accords from his earlier presidency, and the ongoing Gaza plan. If Obama could be honoured for hope, why not Trump for deals?",
    "The counterpoint is that Obama\u2019s prize was itself widely criticised as premature. Even Obama admitted discomfort with it, recognising that it honoured potential more than reality. The lesson drawn by many is that Nobel recognition should rest on durable achievement, not symbolism. By that standard, Trump\u2019s case remains problematic. His initiatives are bold and occasionally substantive, but their sustainability has yet to be proven.",
    "President Trump\u2019s diplomacy is bold, personalised, and theatrical. It occasionally produces results, as seen in Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan, and sometimes launches ambitious ideas, as with Gaza. But much of it remains unfinished or overstated. If the Gaza plan matures into a binding settlement, his Nobel credentials may warrant reconsideration. For now, however, his record falls short of the durable, transformative peace that Nobel juries have historically rewarded.",
    "Trump thrives on dramatic gestures, but the Nobel Prize demands more than drama: it demands peace that endures.",
