    "Bill Gates doesn\u2019t shy away or pretend modesty when it comes to his stature in the climate world today. \u201cWell, who\u2019s the biggest funder of climate innovation companies?\u201d he asked a handful of journalists at a media roundtable event last week. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone else, I\u2019ve never met them.\u201d The former Microsoft CEO has spent the last decade investing in climate technology through Breakthrough Energy, which he founded in 2015. Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he\u2019s thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Let\u2019s get into it.\u00a0  Are we too focused on near-term climate goals? One of the central points Gates made in his new memo is that he thinks the world is too focused on near-term emissions goals and national emissions reporting. So in parallel with the national accounting structure for emissions, Gates argues, we should have high-level climate discussions at events like the UN climate conference. Those discussions should take a global view on how to reduce emissions in key sectors like energy and heavy industry.",
    "\u201cThe way everybody makes steel, it\u2019s the same. The way everybody makes cement, it\u2019s the same. The way we make fertilizer, it\u2019s all the same,\u201d he says. As he noted in one recent essay for MIT Technology Review, he sees innovation as the key to cutting the cost of clean versions of energy, cement, vehicles, and so on. And once products get cheaper, they can see wider adoption.",
    "What\u2019s most likely to power our grid in the future? \u201cIn the long run, probably either fission or fusion will be the cheapest way to make electricity,\u201d he says. (It should be noted that, as with most climate technologies, Gates has investments in both fission and fusion companies through Breakthrough Energy Ventures, so he has a vested interest here.) Related Story2025 Climate Tech Companies to Watch: Kairos Power and its next-generation nuclear reactorsRead next He acknowledges, though, that reactors likely won\u2019t come online quickly enough to meet rising electricity demand in the US: \u201cI wish I could deliver nuclear fusion, like, three years earlier than I can.\u201d He also spoke to China\u2019s leadership in both nuclear fission and fusion energy. \u201cThe amount of money they\u2019re putting [into] fusion is more than the rest of the world put together times two. I mean, it\u2019s not guaranteed to work. But name your favorite fusion approach here in the US\u2014there\u2019s a Chinese project.\u201d Can carbon removal be part of the solution? I had my colleague James Temple\u2019s recent story on what\u2019s next for carbon removal at the top of my mind, so I asked Gates if he saw carbon credits or carbon removal as part of the problematic near-term thinking he wrote about in the memo. Gates buys offsets to cancel out his own personal emissions, to the tune of about $9 million a year, he said at the roundtable, but doesn\u2019t expect many of those offsets to make a significant dent in climate progress on a broader scale: \u201cThat stuff, most of those technologies, are a complete dead end. They don\u2019t get you cheap enough to be meaningful. \u201cCarbon sequestration at $400, $200, $100, can never be a meaningful part of this game. If you have a technology that starts at $400 and can get to $4, then hallelujah, let\u2019s go. I haven\u2019t seen that one. There are some now that look like they can get to $40 or $50, and that can play somewhat of a role.\u201d \u00a0Will AI be good news for innovation?\u00a0 During the discussion, I started a tally in the corner of my notebook, adding a tick every time Gates mentioned AI. Over the course of about an hour, I got to six tally marks, and I definitely missed making a few. Gates acknowledged that AI is going to add electricity demand, a challenge for a US grid that hasn\u2019t seen net demand go up for decades. But so too will electric cars and heat pumps.",
    "I was surprised at just how positively he spoke about AI\u2019s potential, though: \u201cAI will accelerate every innovation pipeline you can name: cancer, Alzheimer's, catalysts in material science, you name it. And we're all trying to figure out what that means. That is the biggest change agent in the world today, moving at a pace that is very, very rapid \u2026 every breakthrough energy company will be able to move faster because of using those tools, some very dramatically.\u201d I\u2019ll add that, as I\u2019ve noted here before, I\u2019m skeptical of big claims about AI\u2019s potential to be a silver bullet across industries, including climate tech.
