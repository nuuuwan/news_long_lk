    "The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has decided to remove \u201cequity\u201d from its inclusion, equity, and diversity (IE&D) framework, now promoting \u201cinclusion and diversity\u201d (I&D) instead. This decision sets a dangerous precedent that flies in the face of decades of research about DEI in the workplace. It undermines efforts to create equitable workplaces and ignores the vital role of equity in fostering fairness and addressing systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups. Instead of scaling back their focus on equity, companies should: 1) Commit to achievable equity goals; 2) Implement and track evidence-based DEI policies and practices; and 3) Establish accountability and transparency.",
