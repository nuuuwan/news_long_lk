Cardinal Ranjith celebrated the golden jubilee of his Priestly Ordination on 29 June 2025

On 29 June 2025, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith celebrated 50 years in the priesthood—a significant milestone in a life dedicated to faith, service, justice, and the pursuit of peace. During a special sermon marking this anniversary, Rev. Fr. Ivan Perera, former Director of Catholic Education, described him as “a principled advocate of justice and reconciliation.” In a world often fractured by religious intolerance and violent extremism, genuine peace-builders emerge as beacons of hope.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, is one such figure—demonstrating that the most powerful response to hatred is not vengeance, but steadfast dedication to dialogue, empathy, and justice. His courageous leadership, particularly in the aftermath of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, has shaped a legacy that transcends ecclesiastical boundaries.

A journey rooted in peace and dialogue

Cardinal Ranjith’s path to becoming a voice for peace is deeply rooted in his faith and international experience. Born into a multi-religious society, educated in Rome, and later serving in Vatican diplomacy, he developed a nuanced understanding of global conflicts and the vital importance of interfaith harmony. Long before the Easter tragedy, he consistently advocated for dialogue among Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority as well as its Hindu, Muslim, and Christian minorities. He recognised early on that sustainable peace depends on mutual respect and understanding that transcend doctrinal differences. Across various platforms, he championed shared values—compassion, human dignity, and the sanctity of life—embedded within all major religions.

The 2019 Easter Sunday bombings: A defining moment

The horrific Easter Sunday attacks, which targeted churches and hotels, claimed over 270 lives—many of them Catholics gathered for worship. It was an unimaginable tragedy. In that moment of intense grief and public outrage, Cardinal Ranjith’s character shone with extraordinary clarity and resolve. In the face of overwhelming grief, he prioritised healing and inter-communal understanding over emotionally charged retaliation. Determined to resist the pull of sectarianism, he visited devastated churches and grieving families, offering solace and dignity to the dead and wounded.

His immediate message was not one of anger or blame but of sorrow, forgiveness, and a resolute plea to reject collective scapegoating. He publicly forgave the attackers, stating that authentic Christian faith demands such grace. He understood that retaliatory violence would only perpetuate the cycle of hatred. At a time when suspicion and fear ran high, he stood firmly against reprisals targeting innocent Muslim communities, reaching out to Muslim leaders and urging national unity.

Cardinal Ranjith’s commitment to peace did not preclude a relentless call for justice. He became a formidable advocate for a full and transparent investigation into the intelligence failures and possible complicity that enabled the attacks. His demands were never rooted in vengeance, but in the pursuit of a just and accountable society—where every citizen, regardless of creed, is protected by the rule of law.

An apostle of courage

What defines Cardinal Ranjith’s mission is his courage. In moments when anger and retribution might have seemed easier, he chose the harder path of restorative justice and bridge-building. He showed that peace is not merely the absence of violence but a deliberate effort to cultivate understanding, seek justice without hatred, and affirm the inherent dignity of every human being—across all social, ethnic, and religious lines. He has also consistently supported the fight against the menace of drug abuse.

A vision beyond religion

As Rev. Fr. Ivan Perera noted, Cardinal Ranjith’s influence extends far beyond the Church. The transformation of the BCI Campus—from an abandoned teacher training college into a thriving institution that now aspires to inspire thousands of young people—symbolises his enduring commitment to youth empowerment and education. He has also faced his fair share of criticism. Some have questioned his outspoken nature and his readiness to step beyond traditional religious roles—particularly when addressing national issues and political affairs. His candid remarks have occasionally unsettled the political establishment, resulting in misunderstandings or even ridicule. Yet, this boldness stems from deep conviction.

Motivated by a profound sense of duty to serve his people and uphold justice, he consistently moves beyond the confines of the pulpit, engaging actively in civic discourse in pursuit of national reconciliation and lasting peace.

A continuing crusade for peace

As Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith continues his journey of service, his life stands as a testament to what courage and spiritual conviction can achieve in a fractured world. He has shown that true leadership is not about position, but purpose—about speaking truth with compassion, standing firm in times of crisis, and offering healing where there is hurt. In a nation still seeking unity and justice, his unwavering voice remains both a moral compass and a call to action.

May his contribution not only inspire the faithful, but also encourage all citizens—regardless of creed—to build bridges, uphold dignity, and work toward a future where reconciliation is more than a hope, but a lived reality. May his peaceful crusade continue—guided by purpose and grace.
