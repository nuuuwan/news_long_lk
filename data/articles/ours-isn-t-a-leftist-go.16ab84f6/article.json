    "Tilvin Silva General Secretary of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna",
    "We cannot move ahead without friendly ties with India, need help from China",
    "We Participated in the ABBA Tribute Concert. We are people with a palate for enjoyment",
    "We have to deal with the IMF in accordance with the mandate exploring flexibility in areas where changes can be done",
    "We are happy that the party won elections in the wake of 35th commemoration of November heroes",
    "We have to grasp the true, serious message of this large mandate which is meant to rebuild the country",
    "There is some form of economic stability now",
    "Tilvin Silva, the General Secretary of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the core base of National People\u2019s Power (NPP), shares his views on the government\u2019s way forward and responds to social media criticism on his participation at ABBA Tribute Concert during an interview with the Daily Mirror.",
    "At the press conference conducted in the immediate aftermath of the general election, you talked about the seriousness of the mammoth mandate your party received.\u00a0 Did you panic because you received such a large mandate?",
    "It is not that we panicked due to the mandate. Ours is a political force different to others.\u00a0 We did not seek a mandate to realise our individual interests. We do not want to be arrogant with power.\u00a0 We only want to resuscitate this country. Whenever an overwhelming majority of people place their trust in us,\u00a0 \u00a0we have to take it with due seriousness. Then only, we can position ourselves for realization of their aspirations.\u00a0 We have to grasp the true, serious message of this large mandate which is meant to rebuild the country.",
    "\u201cOur mission was to create a just and fair society for the people. We engaged in politics for it.\u00a0 In the wake of past attempts to crush our party, we resorted to different means to press ahead with our struggle. Since then, society has evolved and we also adjusted ourselves accordingly.\u00a0 Still, we did not deviate from our founding principles and objectives. We changed our strategies and reorganised ourselves",
    "You got this mandate in the month of November when your party is commemorating its past leaders, including founder leader Rohana Wijeweera, who were assassinated. What do you feel about this victory at such a moment of time?",
    "It is only a coincidence. No matter what, we feel happy that we received this electoral victory came just after the 35th anniversary of our fallen comrades. Our victory has been destined and timed accordingly. Yes, we feel happy over this victory 35 years after our party was crushed.",
    "You have been through thick and thin during this period. Can you comment?",
    "Yes I joined the party in 1978.",
    "In today\u2019s context, is there any practical possibility to realise founding principles and objectives of the party?",
    "Our mission was to create a just and fair society for the people. We engaged in politics for it.\u00a0 In the wake of past attempts to crush our party, we resorted to different means to press ahead with our struggle. Since then, society has evolved and we also adjusted ourselves accordingly.\u00a0 Still, we did not deviate from our founding principles and objectives.\u00a0 We changed our strategies and reorganised ourselves, though.",
    "How do you specify it?",
    "In one era, armed struggles were considered in the world as a way of capturing power. In our movement, we resorted to it as and when the situation demanded.\u00a0 Later, it became a method disregarded in the world. After that, we turned to building a public movement. There were many transformations in the world. Technology evolved and lifestyles altered.\u00a0 People\u2019s necessities have changed since 1965, when we formed the party.\u00a0 \u00a0We harboured the idea right from the beginning that we should secure public support first to gain political power. We tried from the beginning to expand ourselves into public movements. We did it under different terminologies. It did not succeed initially. Yet, in 2018, it became successful. It is a public movement, not a coalition.\u00a0 We chose slogans in terms of public needs.",
    "\u201cThere is no individual staking claims for this (NPP) victory.\u00a0 \u00a0There is a limit to what I can do as an individual.\u00a0 This is the end result of a collective effort.\u00a0 I worked for it. Likewise others such as comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake worked for it.\u00a0 Besides, a whole lot of others who are lesser known to the country worked tirelessly at grassroots level. They call me Loku Ayya because I am the eldest within the party structure",
    "Yours is a party that was opposed to the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) right from the beginning. Now, your party, which is in power, has vowed to proceed with the IMF programme.\u00a0 \u00a0Isn\u2019t it ironic?",
    "What we see are nothing but challenges. We did not inherit a country that was in good shape to be governed.\u00a0 We inherited a country that is bankrupt and finds it difficult to settle huge debts accumulated over the years. It is a country that struck a deal with the IMF on disadvantageous terms. It would have been better had we not struck a deal with the IMF to get out of the current abyss.\u00a0 Now, there is nothing we can do because the agreement has already been signed. It is an agreement between Sri Lanka and the IMF. Whichever party is in power, the agreement has to be honoured. We cannot unilaterally abrogate it. If we do so, we will face serious repercussions.",
    "Now, we have to deal with the IMF in accordance with the mandate exploring flexibility in areas where changes can be done.",
    "Do you have any plan in the future to come out of this IMF programme?",
    "We have not given mind to it. That cannot be done now.\u00a0 We have to move ahead with this agreement with some amendments if possible.\u00a0 There is some form of economic stability now. We have to build on that.\u00a0 Depending on its success in terms of expected economic growth, indigenous economic strengths and our debt sustainability, we can think of the next step in the future.",
    "Now the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has formed the Government. The JVP is its core force.\u00a0 How does the government\u2019s role differ from that of the party?",
    "The party only ensured the electoral victory.\u00a0 Now, there is a government formed after an electoral victory. Both the party and the government are geared for the same objective.\u00a0 However, the entire party machinery has not become part of the government.\u00a0 It means there is one segment of the NPP not being aligned with the government.\u00a0 They continue to engage in political work such as educational activities, organizational activities etc.\u00a0 \u00a0 The JVP is also involved in its drive to increase membership.\u00a0 It is absolutely essential for us.\u00a0 The party machinery is needed to link the government with people.\u00a0 The party\u2019s role is important in ensuring public support to the government\u2019s initiatives. The government needs human resources in discharging its functions.\u00a0 The party has a role in building this human resource. The government and the party are not merged, but interlinked.",
    "\u201cIn this region, India is our neighbour. It is difficult for us to forge ahead without friendly ties with India.\u00a0 In our region, China is one of the most developed countries. We need help from China.\u00a0 Then, problems may crop up because of rivalry between India and China. We are not party to it.\u00a0 Ours is a free and open foreign policy. We are not aligned to anyone",
    "There were reports about the formation of a new mechanism to monitor and guide the government. How official is it?",
    "It is not an official mechanism, but a voluntary initiative. It will involve a large number of MPs who do not hold ministerial responsibilities in our government.\u00a0 Among them are MPs with different talents and interests.\u00a0 Earlier, we had ten committees that formulated policies covering areas such as economy, environment, education etc.\u00a0 All of them who served in these committees are not in the government.\u00a0 Some of them are not MPs. They too can be involved in this mechanism. That is a mechanism to ensure knowledge and expertise of others in running the government.\u00a0 \u00a0In parallel to the government, the party\u2019s structure will operate from grassroots level to the top.",
    "In countries such as China, we find it. Yours is also party based on socialist policies. Is this a replication of the same?",
    "This is based on socialist model for sure. Such systems exist in countries such as China and Vietnam.\u00a0 We had it in Sri Lanka in the past.\u00a0 For example, once Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won elections, the party and the government got merged and became inseparable.\u00a0 The party lost its organizational structure that should otherwise remain independent of the government.\u00a0 Once the government collapsed, it lost everything.\u00a0 For us, power originates from people.\u00a0 In the execution of power, there has to be a nexus between its centre and periphery.\u00a0 The government\u2019s structure, as usual, runs down to the level of Grama Niladhari. The political authority runs down to the local authorities. Simultaneously, we should have the party structure operating right down to grassroots level.",
    "In social media groups, you are referred to as Loku Ayya (Big Brother) by the party cadre.\u00a0 You are also cited as the pioneer of this electoral victory. Are you the key figure behind success?",
    "They may be doing so with affection towards me. There are exaggerations too. There is no individual staking claims for this (NPP) victory.\u00a0 \u00a0There is a limit to what I can do as an individual.\u00a0 This is the end result of a collective effort.\u00a0 I worked for it. Likewise others such as comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake worked for it.\u00a0 Besides, a whole lot of others who are lesser known to the country worked tirelessly at grassroots level.\u00a0 They call me Loku Ayya because I am the eldest within the party structure.",
    "It means you are the senior most comrade?",
    "No. Comrade Jinadasa Kitulegoda is there in the Central Committee of the party.\u00a0 He has been there since 1971.\u00a0 In the board of office bearers, I am the senior most.\u00a0 \u00a0All comrades call me Ayya.\u00a0 For them, I am more like the eldest brother of their family.\u00a0 They lovingly call me Loku Ayya. Otherwise, I am not the sole spiritual leader -like figure.",
    "As far as the foreign policy is concerned, there are concerns raised. Some countries believe whether yours will be following leftist policies.\u00a0 There are concerns raised that you will lean more towards China and compromise ties with neighbouring India.\u00a0 What is the actual policy?",
    "Earlier, those who raise such concerns said that our party had no understanding of geopolitics and world politics. They now talk with a different tone in this manner. It is a twist of destiny for them.\u00a0 We are a party reading on and learning politics.\u00a0 We have an understanding of world politics and its contradictions.\u00a0 Ours is not a party relying on business deals with countries.\u00a0 In this region, India is our neighbour. It is difficult for us to forge ahead without friendly ties with India.\u00a0 In our region, China is one of the most developed countries. We need help from China.\u00a0 Then, problems may crop up because of rivalry between India and China. We are not party to it.\u00a0 Ours is a free and open foreign policy. We are not aligned to anyone.\u00a0 We are not servile to anyone.\u00a0 Therefore, we can have balanced ties with both India and China.\u00a0 We seek to foster ties with Japan, Vietnam, the Middle-East and Europe. Likewise, we plan for ties with Africa. We have started bringing about changes in Foreign Service. Ours is not a leftist government, but a government of legist, progressive, democratic forces.",
    "There is a huge social media outcry about your participation in the ABBA Tribute Show at the Mount Lavonia Hotel recently. What is your response?",
    "Actually, I am not keen on talking about it.\u00a0 The forces that were defeated seek to cling to something or another.\u00a0 The Mount Lavinia Hotel handled it. The event was organised to promote tourism.\u00a0 I, along with Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath, was invited. There were others in the party who were invited. They came here to this office and handed it over to us.",
    "If there is an invitation from an organization for an event, we are duty bound to attend it. If there is an invitation for a wedding, you participate in it.\u00a0 There was a table reserved for us. It is true that the ticket had been priced at Rs.50,000.\u00a0 There had been tickets priced Rs.30,000, 15,000 and 7,500 too.\u00a0 We attended it. We enjoyed it. We are people with a palate for enjoyment.",
    "There is speculation that you will step down as the party\u2019s General Secretary to make way for Mr. Bimal Ratnayake to take charge. Is it true?",
    "We have not taken such a decision. We are not here to be in positions forever. There is no need to change this position in a hurry. There is a tussle among social media groups running pages to increase views. They publish sensational news stories like this to gain attraction."
