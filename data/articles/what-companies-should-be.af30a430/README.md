In a year of febrile politics, rising popular frustration with institutions, and two separate attempts to assassinate President Trump, the risks to executives in just about any industry cannot be minimized. The presence of an estimated more than 400 million firearms in the United States, combined with easy access to personal location data, schedules, and life patterns only adds to the danger.

One effective assessment tool for execs and chief security officers alike is to examine three simple factors of risk: threat, vulnerability, and consequence. By looking closely at each component, companies can assess the nature, degree, and seriousness of virtually any risk.
