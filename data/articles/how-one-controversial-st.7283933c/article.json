    "Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change\u2014for a price. The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects\u00a0 nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they\u2019ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.\u00a0  The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it\u2019s the \u201conly technologically feasible solution\u201d to climate change, the company said. The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.",
    "Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley\u2019s simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It\u2019s a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness. But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials\u2014and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They\u2019re also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ve ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,\u201d says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.\u201d The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company\u2019s first extensive interviews with MIT Technology Review for this story.Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it\u2019s appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology. That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years. \u201cIt could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it could be much worse. We\u2019re saying we\u2019d better be ready.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to decide, and I\u2019ll say humbly, it\u2019s not for these researchers to decide,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.\u201d The building blocks No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company\u2019s lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel\u2019s secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.  Stardust CEO Yanai Yedvab (right) and Chief Product Officer Amyad Spector (left) at the company's facility in Israel. ROBY YAHAV, STARDUST   Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon.\u00a0 Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change.",
    "\u201cMaybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,\u201d he says. Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm\u00a0 cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company\u2019s earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million. Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects. \u201cEssentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,\u201d he says.\u00a0  The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere\u2014for a fee\u2014by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering.\u00a0 But Stardust is serious, and now it\u2019s raised serious money from serious people\u2014all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use. \u201cThat marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,\u201d says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a more dangerous era now.\u201d Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdA location I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI. Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet.",
    "It\u2019s essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results \u201cto ensure there\u2019s no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,\u201d MacMartin says. \u201c[It] shouldn\u2019t be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.\u201dHe criticized, for instance, the company\u2019s claims to have developed\u00a0what he described as their\u00a0\u201cmagic aerosol particle,\u201d arguing that the assertion that it is perfectly safe and inert can\u2019t be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims. Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn\u2019t be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world\u2019s nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in \u201ca fair, inclusive, and effective manner.\u201d",
    "\u201cSolar geoengineering is not necessary,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cNeither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.\u201d The for-profit decision\u00a0 Stardust says it\u2019s important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world\u2019s ability to respond to it, requiring a new \u201cclass of solution \u2026 that buys us time and protects us from overheating.\u201d  Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered \u201cmost of the groundbreaking technologies\u201d in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer. He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent. \u201cThere is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,\u201d he says. He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they\u2019ve done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.",
    "Related StoryBig Tech's big bet on a controversial carbon removal tacticRead next \u201cIt seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,\u201d the company said in a follow-up email. \u201cEventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we\u2019re confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.\u201d Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.\u201cThere is no way this field could move forward if you don\u2019t have this governance framework, if you don\u2019t have external validation, if you don\u2019t have clear regulation,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they\u2019re favorable or not. That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says.",
    "Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence \u201csubstantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,\u201d he says, \u201cso that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.\u201d In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d but said it is \u201cthe only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.\u201d \u201cThe only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions\u2014which is what we see as our role,\u201d the company added later. \u201cWe are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.\u201d Ambitious projections Stardust\u2019s earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first \u201cstratospheric aerial experiments\u201d last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment). On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a \u201clarge-scale demonstration\u201d around 2030 and proceed to a \u201cglobal full-scale deployment\u201d by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively. Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly. Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues.\u00a0 \u201cWe won\u2019t have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,\u201d she says.  A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies\u2014and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved. There\u2019s also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust\u2019s materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of After Geoengineering. \u201cIt is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,\u201d Buck wrote in an email. She says the timelines are also \u201cunrealistic\u201d because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely).\u00a0 Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups.\u00a0 Related StoryThis startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuelRead next Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust\u2019s for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says. \u201cI find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,\u201d she says. \u201cWe actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.\u201d Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you\u2019d turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,\u201d he says. An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts.\u00a0 \u201cWhat if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?\u201d asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2008. \u201cShould global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today\u2019s reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?\u201d Revised plans Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust\u2019s strategy at a \u201cvery early stage in our work,\u201d adding that their thinking has \u201cevolved,\u201d partly in response to consultations with experts in the field. He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, \u201cThat\u2019s a necessary but not sufficient condition.\u201d \u201cGovernments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could be a case that they will say \u2018We want to move forward.\u2019 It could be a case that they will say \u2018We want to wait a few years.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for them to make these decisions,\u201d he says. Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the Wall Street Journal reported last year. It\u2019s also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility. But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn\u2019t conducted outdoor particle experiments and won\u2019t move forward with them until it has approval from governments.\u00a0  \u201cEventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.\u201d But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, \u201cshould be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.\u201d Generating returns \u00a0 Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there\u2019s no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could \u201cdrive the timelines,\u201d says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University.\u00a0 And that raises a different set of concerns. Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says.\u00a0 \u201cThe whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that\u2019s the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.\u201d She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good. Stardust has \u201cquietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill\u201d and has hired the law firm Holland & Knight, according to Politico. It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop \u201cstrategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,\u201d according to a case study on the company\u2019s\u00a0 website.\u00a0  \u201cThe company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,\u201d Red Duke states. \u201cThis effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.\u201d Red Duke didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry from MIT Technology Review. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort. Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it\u2019s not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it\u2019s making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering. \u201cWhen we speak to policymakers\u2014and we speak to policymakers; we don\u2019t hide it\u2014essentially, what we tell them is \u2018Listen, there is a solution,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not decades away\u2014it\u2019s a few years away. And it\u2019s your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.\u2019\u201d \u201cAny solution needs checks and balances,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is how we see the checks and balances.\u201d Related StoryThree things to know about the future of electricityRead next He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change. \u201cWe are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.\u201d He says the company\u2019s investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust\u2019s work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts. Lowercarbon Capital didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry from MIT Technology Review. \u2018Sentiment of hope\u2019 Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes.\u00a0 In Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s 2020 novel, The Ministry for the Future, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people.\u00a0 Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, Geoengineering: The Gamble, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set.\u00a0 But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death. \u201cWe understand that probably it will not be perfect,\u201d Yedvab says. \u201cWe understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.\u201d \u201cI think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,\u201d he adds. hide"
