The New Orleans terror attack on New Year’s Day, the Tesla truck bomb outside a hotel owned by President-elect Donald Trump the same day, billionaire Elon Musk’s anti-Muslim X posts, the Christmas Eve attack in a German market, renewed allegations of Muslim Asians raping British girls, and similar reports appear to indicate an orchestrated attempt to rekindle Islamophobia.

Although the Islamic State (ISIS) was blamed for the New Orleans and the German market attacks, there is certainly more to it than meets the eye. ISIS is neither Islamic nor a state. It is a terror outfit controlled by states hell-bent on achieving national interest and geopolitical objectives even if it means stoking terrorism. Events unfolding in Syria only give credence to the claim that Israel and Western imperialism control Islamic radicalism and radical outfits.

The ISIS ideology and actions are far from Islamic, for Islam does not condone terrorism. Any student of Islam knows that in Islam, if a person kills someone, it is as though he has killed the entire humanity, and conversely, if a person saves someone, it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity. ISIS is a tool created by those who seek to achieve not only their geopolitical or national interest objectives but also to discredit Islam and portray it as a religion of terrorism and evil. No wonder, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion.

Islamophobia is not a recent phenomenon. It is as old as Islam. In a narrower sense, it has been there ever since the Prophet Muhammad began his mission 1,450 years ago in Arabia. In a broader sense, every prophet and philosopher who came before him preaching monotheism or social reforms saw their opponents—often the rich and the powerful—resorting to fear-mongering, hate speech, and various nefarious activities to discredit their message.

Islamophobia is today a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing. Partnering with big-power intelligence agencies, it resorts to fearmongering and spreads misinformation and conspiracy theories about Muslims and Islam.

Not long ago, Sri Lanka experienced a surge in Islamophobia, culminating in the tragic Easter Sunday attacks and anti-Muslim violence. Whenever significant instances of Islamophobia arise, the government must probe any potential involvement of foreign actors, particularly those with significant global influence.

This does not mean that Zahran Hashim and his co-terrorists were not to be blamed for the Easter carnage. Far from it. They represented what Islam is not. They were believers of a violent theology and thus have become natural partners of Islamophobic architects.

Although Islam and terrorism have no connection, the so-called Islamic terrorism is very much a reality. Various groups continue to attract Muslim youths who are angry at what is happening in Gaza and elsewhere. In Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the new rulers with al-Qaeda credentials, attracted fighters as far afield as Central Asia. However, the strong probability is that such radical groups are controlled by a foreign spy agency, often without their knowledge.

Islamophobic architects leave no stone unturned to make Islam a religion of terrorists and thereby achieve their goals. The terror laboratories work 24/7, especially Israeli intelligence Mossad. They produce Israeli agents fluent in Arabic and conversant in the Quran and the scholarly work of Islamic theologians, including Ibn Taiymiyyah, Abdul Wahhab, and Syed Kutb—the trio whose writings were essential references for terrorists like ISIS founder leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

A few months ago, some websites, including Israeli websites, reported a news item that went unreported in the mainstream media. The news item was about the arrest of an ISIS leader who was working as a mosque imam under the sobriquet Abu Hafs. The Benghazi security forces who interrogated him learnt that the man who spoke fluent Arabic in a Libyan dialect was indeed Mossad agent Ephraim Benjamin.

During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the US financed the printing of a jihad alphabet to be distributed among the tender minds studying in Afghan refugee camp madrasas in Pakistan. In this alphabet, the Pashtun letter ‘ja’ is for jihad or holy war, ‘ta’ is for tufang (meaning rifle), and ‘za’ is for zulm, meaning oppression, with a footnote adding that Russians are oppressors.

The more Israel and other Islamophobic architects succeed in injecting anti-Islam hate into targeted audiences, the easier it becomes for them to achieve their goals. Given Mossad’s false flag op dexterity, stories galore in the alternative media about a Mossad script behind the New Orleans attack that killed 15 people. The attack was perhaps timed to reverse the growing support in the United States for the Palestinian cause, especially among the young and educated. Since a majority of the Palestinians are Muslims, the more hatred towards Islam is generated through terror attacks attributed to Islamic groups, the less sympathy there will be in the US, Europe, and other countries for the suffering people in Gaza.

Israel’s Islamophobic programme did not start on October 7, 2023, the day on which the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas launched a surprise attack that led to a conflict in which some 1,100 Israeli and foreign nationals were killed. The programme was rolled out no sooner than the Cold War ended in 1991. Islam replaced the defeated communism, with warts and all. Overnight, Jihadi Islam became the most discussed security topic around the world.

Israeli leaders and Israeli-sponsored journalists employed at Fox News, CNN, and other outlets, along with Israeli-funded US politicians, were at the forefront of a campaign to warn of a coming Islamic terror wave. Days before the February 1993 attack on the World Trade Centre in New York by a suspected Islamic group, then-Israeli President Chaim Herzog was quoted as saying that Israel was engaged in a major battle against Iranian-controlled Islamic fundamentalism. “It’s true that there’s no Soviet Union now threatening, but there are all sorts of lunatic states like Iran and Iraq and so forth which could upset the balance in the world.”

David Miller, a British professor of sociology and an expert in Islamophobia studies, insists that the idea of Islamic terrorism was invented by Zionist intellectuals in the 1990s and streamlined at a Washington DC conference organised by none other than Benjamin Netanyahu, who is today an international war crime suspect and head of the genocide-committing Israeli government.

Writing about Islamic terrorism, Mossad agents became celebrated authors of best sellers. Capitalising on the 1993 World Trade Centre attack was a Mossad agent turned academic turned author, Yossef Bodansky. The back cover of his best-selling book, ‘Target America: Terrorism in the US,’ had this warning: “The terrorists are coming, and no Americans will be safe.”

The Islamic bogey thus created gains more flesh with each terror attack with an Islamic label. Each such terror attack has the potential to ratchet up anti-Islamic sentiments, which enable Israel to pursue its expansionist policy with little or no international pressure. Little wonder, Israel says it is fighting Islamic terrorism from the frontlines and protecting the rest of the world. Sadly, many people fall prey to deception.

It is concerning that the surge in Islamophobia, together with Elon Musk’s anti-Muslim X campaign, comes ahead of pro-Zionist Trump’s inauguration as the new US president on January 20. The combination could not be worse.
