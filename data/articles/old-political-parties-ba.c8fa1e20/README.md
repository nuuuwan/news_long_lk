Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

I am appalled to see how all the old political parties are scrambling to form alliances against the NPP for the upcoming general election. These are the same corrupt figures who took a different stance during the Presidential election, and now they’re back to their old tricks. Meanwhile, the NPP is showing wisdom by steering clear of these alliances, positioning themselves to secure over 113 seats in Parliament.

It’s time for the other party leaders to walk the talk and stop playing blame games. Instead of dwelling on the past, they should focus on presenting their manifestos for the upcoming election and offer real solutions to the public. It’s clear that the people are well-informed and no longer fooled by these antics.

I also find it amusing to see party leaders excited about corruption cases being raised, challenging the AKD government with just three ministers. This seems like a fear-driven response, jumping the gun before anything has even happened. To those leaders—take a step back, relax, and let the AKD government focus on good governance.

This is the first real opportunity in four decades to root out corruption, bring justice for murders and missing persons, and set things right. Let’s give them the chance to fulfil what they promised during the Presidential campaign.
