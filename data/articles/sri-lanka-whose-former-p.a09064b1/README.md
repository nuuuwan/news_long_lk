Hours after Bangladesh Prime MinisterSheikh Hasina quit and fled the country on Monday following mass protests, Sri Lanka — whose former President was ousted by a citizen’s uprising two years ago — expressed solidarity with the people of Bangladesh.

“Our hearts are with the people of #Bangladesh during these incredibly challenging times. The recent events have led to significant unrest and, tragically, the loss of many lives. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those affected and to all who are suffering during this difficult period,” said Foreign Minister Ali Sabry in a message on social media platform ‘X’ Monday, August 5, 2024 night.

Mr. Sabry served as Minister of Justice and later, Minister of Finance under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was booted out of office in 2022. “Sri Lanka values its enduring friendship with Bangladesh and stands in solidarity with its people. We believe in the resilience and unity of the Bangladeshi nation and hope for a swift return to peace and stability,” he said
