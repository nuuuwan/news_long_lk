    "People often frame artificial intelligence (AI) in binary terms, as a technology that will either save us or replace us. However, this can be simplistic. The real story of AI is one of expanding possibilities: the potential to create new markets, redefine industries, and fuel new forms of economic growth through new customer experiences, data-driven services, and more scalable and adaptive business models.",
    "AI as a Business Enhancer",
    "When electricity became widely available, it didn\u2019t just make factories more efficient; it gave rise to new classes of products, services, and companies.",
    "The digital revolution has followed a similar pattern. The internet does more than automate communications\u2014it has enabled the rise of digital marketplaces, streaming platforms, and cloud-native businesses.",
    "AI today is on the same trajectory. Eighty-two percent of global business leaders are now adopting AI, according to the Arm AI Readiness Index, and 80% are allocating dedicated budgets for it. While conventional wisdom about the technology emphasizes job displacement and operational efficiencies, AI is laying the groundwork for new business models, experiences, services, and systems, including:",
    "\u2022 AI-native services, with companies building applications using predictive modeling, generative design, and conversational interfaces that would not have been feasible even five years ago.",
    "\u2022 Intelligent infrastructure, with AI enabling smart logistics, energy optimization, and adaptive manufacturing that respond to real-time conditions.",
    "\u2022 Hyper-personalized experiences, with businesses using AI to dynamically tailor services\u2014such as health care diagnostics and e-commerce recommendations\u2014to individual users on a massive scale.",
    "Transformation Across Industries",
    "The effects of the AI-enabled transformation are already changing various industries. In health care, McKinsey estimates, generative AI could enable cost reductions of up to 50% in clinical-trial processes and lead to a 12-month (or more) acceleration in conducting trials, so lifesaving treatments can reach patients faster. AI is also supporting the development of personalized medicine and empowering people to make better-informed health decisions through insights available via their wearable devices.",
    "In the automotive industry, vehicle manufacturers are embedding AI into most aspects of the vehicle and overall driving experience, including automated driving features for greater autonomy on the road, personalized content based on driver and passenger preferences, and automatic predictive maintenance that identifies and fixes issues in real time.",
    "The energy sector is using AI in smart grid management systems to balance energy loads, mitigating the stress from peak demands to reduce disruptions and overall emissions. In telecommunications, AI\u2019s ability to predict demand lets networks optimize their infrastructure, ensuring they still work during peak use.",
    "In manufacturing, smart factories are using AI to dynamically adjust production lines in milliseconds and detect anomalies to improve quality control and safety, creating more responsive and sustainable operations.",
    "The retail industry is using AI both to make e-commerce recommendations to customers and to manage logistics and supply chains more effectively. Real-time route optimization, inventory forecasting, and predictive maintenance are all becoming standard.",
    "These changes indicate a broad economic transformation. AI is not eliminating roles but redefining what industries can do and creating more innovation opportunities.",
    "Cloud-to-Edge Infrastructure",
    "Whether it\u2019s a startup developing vision AI for smart agriculture, a health care provider deploying patient monitoring at the edge, or a global streaming platform running generative AI models in the cloud, successful AI deployment depends on having the right computing infrastructure in place.",
    "Businesses need integrated, scalable computing infrastructure that enables them to train, deploy, and run AI workloads wherever they can deliver the most value, whether in the cloud when training large language models or aggregating vast data sets, or at the edge where latency-sensitive inference tasks, like real-time personalization or text-to-speech, are increasingly moving.",
    "At the same time, computing infrastructure needs to be portable, efficient, and unified across every layer of AI development and deployment. A consistent compute foundation\u2014from the hyperscaler to the handset\u2014helps developers reuse models, reduce overhead, speed up time to market, and scale their innovations, paving the way for new AI applications across industries.",
    "Responsible, Safe, Secure AI",
    "Unlocking the full potential of AI means deploying it responsibly, especially as businesses become increasingly reliant on AI-powered insights for both internal operations and external services to customers. Along with standard internal compliance and audits, businesses need to build their systems on a secure and trusted digital infrastructure to embed trust and transparency into AI systems and to create inclusive opportunities for innovation.",
    "Close government and industry collaboration is crucial to ensuring that AI infrastructure is secure, interoperable, and equitably distributed. Responsible AI deployment includes promoting open standards, strong security, and long-term sustainability. By treating AI not as a closed product but as a shared open platform, the entire industry can move faster and more confidently into the AI era.",
    "From Efficiency to Possibility",
    "While AI can make businesses more efficient, the greater opportunities lie in its ability to help businesses reimagine what they offer, how they operate, and who they serve.",
    "Just as past technology revolutions created more opportunities than they displaced, AI will do the same. However, this outcome relies on adopting the right compute foundation to support this once-in-a-generation shift. This means investing in efficient compute platforms in the cloud and at the edge, fostering open ecosystems, and putting innovation in the hands of as many people as possible.",
    "Business leaders who view AI as a catalyst for reinvention will be best positioned to unlock new value and competitive advantages, redefining the next era of experiences, operations, and services for their companies.",
    "The ubiquity of the Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) platform\u2014which touches 100% of the connected global population\u2014ensures AI compute is accessible to all types of businesses, not just the hyperscalers and big corporations. By delivering efficient performance from cloud to the edge, Arm is helping companies of all sizes build AI services and systems that are cost-effective, energy-aware, and ready to scale."
