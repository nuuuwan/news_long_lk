- From 2010-2023, 111 gazettes were published to change ministry duties, functions, institutions, or laws.
- Frequent changes in ministry compositions have led to fragmented and misaligned government operations.
- Subjects that should be under a single ministry are often split, leading to inefficiencies.
- Unrelated subjects are frequently housed together in single ministries (e.g., Ministry of Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs).
- Example shifts of institutions: The Department of Immigration and Emigration changed ownership 10 times since 2015.
- The National Lotteries Board changed ownership 8 times, once being under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 2015.
- Verit√© Research suggests creating a rational government structure with fewer, more logically grouped ministries.
- Recommendations include a limit of 15 ministries and appointing a structured set of three ministers per ministry.
- Proposed constitutional amendments to specify the number and outline of ministries to reduce frequent changes.
- Purpose: To create a more rational, effective, and efficient public service in Sri Lanka.
