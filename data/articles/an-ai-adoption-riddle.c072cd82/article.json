    "A few weeks ago, I set out on what I thought would be a straightforward reporting journey.\u00a0 After years of momentum for AI\u2014even if you didn't think it would be good for the world, you probably thought it was powerful enough to take seriously\u2014hype for the technology had been slightly punctured. First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending?  I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs, the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.\u00a0 But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to perhaps not go all in on AI were nowhere to be found. Or, at least, none that were willing to admit it. What gives?",
    "There are several interpretations of this one reporter\u2019s quest (which, for the record, I\u2019m presenting as an anecdote and not a representation of the economy), but let\u2019s start with the easy ones. First is that this is a huge score for the \u201cAI is a bubble\u201d believers. What is a bubble if not a situation where companies continue to spend relentlessly even in the face of worrying news? The other is that underneath the bad headlines, there\u2019s not enough genuinely troubling news about AI to convince companies they should pivot.

I spoke with Martha Gimbel, who leads the Yale Budget Lab and coauthored a report finding that AI has not yet changed anyone\u2019s jobs. What I gathered is that Gimbel, like many economists, thinks on a longer time scale than anyone in the AI world is used to.",
    "\u201cIt would be historically shocking if a technology had had an impact as quickly as people thought that this one was going to,\u201d she says. In other words, perhaps most of the economy is still figuring out what the hell AI even does, not deciding whether to abandon it.\u00a0 The other reaction I heard\u2014particularly from the consultant crowd\u2014is that when executives hear that so many AI pilots are failing, they indeed take it very seriously. They\u2019re just not reading it as a failure of the technology itself. They instead point to pilots not moving quickly enough, companies lacking the right data to build better AI, or a host of other strategic reasons. Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdAn industry I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI.Even if there is incredible pressure, especially on public companies, to invest heavily in AI, a few have taken big swings on the technology only to pull back. The buy now, pay later company Klarna laid off staff and paused hiring in 2024, claiming it could use AI instead. Less than a year later it was hiring again, explaining that \u201cAI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy.\u201d\u00a0 Drive-throughs, from McDonald\u2019s to Taco Bell, ended pilots testing the use of AI voice assistants. The vast majority of Coca-Cola advertisements, according to experts I spoke with, are not made with generative AI, despite the company\u2019s $1 billion promise.\u00a0 So for now, the question remains unanswered: Are there companies out there rethinking how much their bets on AI will pay off, or when? And if there are, what\u2019s keeping them from talking out loud about it? (If you\u2019re out there, email me!) hide"
