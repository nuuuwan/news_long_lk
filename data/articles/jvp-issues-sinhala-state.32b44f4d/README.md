The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the chief constituent of Sri Lanka’s ruling National People’s Power (NPP) coalition, on Sunday (January 4, 2025) “strongly condemned” the United States’ actions in Venezuela.

“We strongly condemn the United States of America’s military aggression against the independent and sovereign State of Venezuela and the abduction of democratically elected President Nicholas Maduro and his wife,” the leftist JVP said in a statement issued in Sinhala.

According to reports in local media, the statement — which party General Secretary Tilvin Silva also shared on his Facebook page — said: “As in any other free and sovereign state, the right to determine the future, and the leaders of the country, rests on the people of Venezuela. Powerful countries do not have the right to violate this principle.”

Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued a statement on the development so far. No member of the government has commented yet.

Further, the JVP statement said that modern society and governance “should be civilised”. “Democracy, human rights, and the sovereignty of states are universally accepted principles. Military aggressions and invasions against sovereign states in violation of these principles cannot be justified,” it said, adding that it stands for Venezuela’s sovereignty and independence.

“We believe that nobody will approve of the forceful military aggression against Venezuela by the United States of America,” it further said.
