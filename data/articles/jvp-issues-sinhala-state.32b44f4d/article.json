    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the chief constituent of Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling National People\u2019s Power (NPP) coalition, on Sunday (January 4, 2025) \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the United States\u2019 actions in Venezuela.",
    "\u201cWe strongly condemn the United States of America\u2019s military aggression against the independent and sovereign State of Venezuela and the abduction of democratically elected President Nicholas Maduro and his wife,\u201d the leftist JVP said in a statement issued in Sinhala.",
    "According to reports in local media, the statement \u2014 which party General Secretary Tilvin Silva also shared on his Facebook page \u2014 said: \u201cAs in any other free and sovereign state, the right to determine the future, and the leaders of the country, rests on the people of Venezuela. Powerful countries do not have the right to violate this principle.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued a statement on the development so far. No member of the government has commented yet.",
    "Further, the JVP statement said that modern society and governance \u201cshould be civilised\u201d. \u201cDemocracy, human rights, and the sovereignty of states are universally accepted principles. Military aggressions and invasions against sovereign states in violation of these principles cannot be justified,\u201d it said, adding that it stands for Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty and independence.",
    "\u201cWe believe that nobody will approve of the forceful military aggression against Venezuela by the United States of America,\u201d it further said."
