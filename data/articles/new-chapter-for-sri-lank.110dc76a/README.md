President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the NPP now have the mandate to rewrite Sri Lanka’s story

With the recent General election victory of the National People’s Power (NPP), Sri Lanka has entered a new chapter in its history. This moment of transition offers a unique opportunity to address the deep-rooted issues that have plagued our governance, economy, and social fabric. The people of Sri Lanka have spoken decisively, expressing their desire for change, transparency, and a fresh approach to leadership.

This article seeks to advise the new administration on critical priorities, highlighting the mistakes of the past and proposing pathways to ensure long-term prosperity, public satisfaction, and fiscal responsibility.

Learning from past governance failures

Over the years, successive governments have been criticised for systemic corruption, policy inconsistency, and economic mismanagement. From large-scale scandals like the Central Bank Bond Scam and the Avant Garde Maritime Scandal to misjudged projects like the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and many more, public trust in leadership has eroded significantly.

The consequences of these failures are stark:

nCrippling debt: Mismanaged loans and poorly conceived projects have contributed to an unsustainable debt burden.

nPublic distrust: A lack of accountability has alienated citizens from their leaders.

nEconomic inefficiency: Corruption and nepotism have stifled innovation and productivity, discouraging both local and foreign investment.

It is imperative that the new administration acknowledges these past missteps, takes corrective action, and ensures that such errors are not repeated.

Priorities for the new administration

Eradicating corruption:

Establish an independent anti-corruption commission with robust powers to investigate and prosecute wrongdoings. The existing Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to be activated to work efficiently.

Digitise public procurement and governance processes to minimise human intervention and enhance transparency.

Create whistleblower protection mechanisms to encourage reporting of malpractices.

Strengthening economic management:

Develop a clear, actionable plan for debt repayment while safeguarding essential social services.

Diversify the economy by focusing on export-oriented industries, technology, tourism, and agriculture. The right kind of promotions and the initiatives like Clean Sri Lanka can improve the tourism and foreign exchange inflows.

Encourage local entrepreneurship, startups and small businesses with tax incentives, easier access to credit, and streamlined regulations.

Good governance and accountability:

Implement structural reforms to ensure independence and efficiency in the judiciary and public institutions.

Enhance parliamentary oversight mechanisms to scrutinise government spending and policies.

Foster an open government model with regular public consultations and updates on key initiatives.

Promoting unity and inclusivity:

Launch programs to foster ethnic and religious reconciliation, promoting a united national identity. This year election results demands this from the Government and serious attention is required.

Ensure equitable development across all regions, addressing disparities in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Advancing environmental sustainability:

Invest in renewable energy projects, leveraging Sri Lanka’s natural resources for solar, wind, and hydropower.

Protect biodiversity by strengthening laws against deforestation, pollution, and illegal mining.

Develop green urban planning initiatives to improve the quality of life in cities.

Engaging the global community:

Maintain a balanced foreign policy, emphasising partnerships that benefit national interests.

Secure international aid and technical expertise to support development while ensuring transparency in fund utilisation.

Enhance Sri Lanka’s image as a reliable trade and investment partner.

A vision for a better tomorrow

The road ahead will not be easy. Paying off Sri Lanka’s massive debts while meeting the aspirations of its citizens requires both visionary leadership and collective effort. However, with the right strategies and a commitment to justice, equity, and accountability, the country can achieve sustainable growth.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the NPP now have the mandate to rewrite Sri Lanka’s story. By focusing on governance reforms, economic prudence, and social justice, they can inspire hope and rebuild the nation’s confidence. The business community, civil society, and international partners are ready to support this transformative journey, provided it is guided by integrity and a shared vision for progress.

Let this moment be a turning point—a new beginning where Sri Lanka rises as a beacon of responsible governance, economic resilience, and social harmony.
