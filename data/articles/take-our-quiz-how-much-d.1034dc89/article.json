    "This week we had some terrifying news from the World Health Organization: Antibiotics are failing us. A growing number of bacterial infections aren\u2019t responding to these medicines\u2014including common ones that affect the blood, gut, and urinary tract. Get infected with one of these bugs, and there\u2019s a fair chance antibiotics won\u2019t help.\u00a0 The scary truth is that a growing number of harmful bacteria and fungi are becoming resistant to drugs. Just a few weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report finding a sharp rise in infections caused by a dangerous type of bacteria that are resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics. Now, the WHO report shows that the problem is surging around the world. In this week\u2019s Checkup, we\u2019re trying something a bit different\u2014a little quiz. You\u2019ve probably heard about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) before, but how much do you know about microbes, antibiotics, and the scale of the problem? Here\u2019s our attempt to put the \u201cfun\u201d in \u201cfundamental threat to modern medicine.\u201d Test your knowledge below!
