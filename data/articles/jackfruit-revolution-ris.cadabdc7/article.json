    "Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry",
    "From humble beginnings to global stardom",
    "Imagine a fruit so versatile it can mimic the taste and texture of pulled pork and shredded chicken, so sustainable it thrives with minimal resources, and so nutritious it\u2019s a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals. Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry.",
    "Native to Southeast Asia and boasting the title of the largest tree-borne fruit on Earth, jackfruit has transcended its Sri Lankan roots to become a global culinary sensation. Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title \u201cRice Tree\u201d.",
    "A versatile star on the rise",
    "Jackfruit is not only delicious but also a nutritional powerhouse. Packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fibre, it offers a range of health benefits. It\u2019s an excellent source of vitamin C, which supports immune function and collagen production. Potassium and magnesium contribute to heart health and muscle function. Additionally, jackfruit\u2019s fibre content aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. While it\u2019s not a complete protein like meat, it provides a good amount of protein compared to other fruits, making it a valuable addition to vegetarian and vegan diets as well as for those keen on healthy weight management.",
    "This commonly available naturally grown food produce in Sri Lanka, with very high medicinal properties, is the ideal gold mine for those who are passionate on winning the global food based entrepreneurship. Jackfruit is not only highly cherished for its versatility and unique flavour profile, but also because of its massive size and fibrous meaty texture, makes it a culinary chameleon internationally, rapidly gaining popularity as a sustainable plant-based alternative to meat. Moreover, the jackfruit\u2019s neutral flavour allows it to absorb the tastes of the spices and ingredients it\u2019s cooked with, making it suitable for various cuisines and dishes. This combination has sparked a global culinary revolution, propelling jackfruit to the forefront of the plant-based food industry also embraced by international brands like Starbucks and Pizza Hut. This versatility makes it a popular choice for vegan and vegetarian dishes to adding creative twist to pizzas, wraps, tacos, burgers and flavourful curries.",
    "A sustainable solution with stable income",
    "Driven by growing concerns about the health, environmental, and ethical implications of animal agriculture, international consumers are increasingly seeking plant-based alternatives. Jackfruit trees are prolific growers, requiring minimal water and resources compared to meat production, making the perfect sustainable solution, contributing to reduced environmental impact. Additionally, jackfruit trees can help diversify agricultural practices, promoting biodiversity and supporting sustainable livelihoods for local farmers and communities with its year round production.",
    "A brighter future for Sri Lanka fuelled by sustainability",
    "Sri Lankan farmers, well-versed in the jackfruit\u2019s potential, can well capitalise on this rising global demand as a stable income source while also promoting agroforestry practices. It is no secret that, sadly, per year, thousands of jackfruits fall and rot island-wide. Nevertheless, local businesses who follow the international food trends, are actively processing and exporting jackfruit in various forms, catering to diverse needs of all consumer levels starting from infants. From versatile jackfruit flakes, and pre-seasoned jackfruit patty options to convenient ready-to-eat jackfruit curries and refreshing natural drinks, with the increasing global popularity of Jackfruit, the possibilities are endless. This surge in international popularity creates new economic opportunities, empowers local communities, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.",
    "As the global plant-based market continues to expand, Sri Lanka can be well poised to become a key player in the jackfruit revolution with its versatility, sustainability, and nutritional benefits. With the rich culinary heritage, innovative processing techniques, and commitment to sustainability, the island nation is uniquely positioned to lead the way in this exciting new chapter of food production.",
    "The transformative journey of Sri Lankan jackfruit from a local staple food to a global symbol, is a testament to the power of tradition, innovation, and sustainability. As the world embraces plant-based alternatives, the humble jackfruit is taking centre stage offering a delicious and responsible solution for a more mindful future of a healthier planet and food security.",
