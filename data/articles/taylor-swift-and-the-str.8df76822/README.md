Taylor Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour, wrapping up December 8 in Vancouver, has redefined the modern concert experience. With more than 150 shows across five continents and a staggering $10 billion impact on local economies, it’s the highest-grossing tour in history. Beyond the numbers, Swift has mastered the art of fan engagement, continuously releasing fresh music and using platforms like TikTok to amplify her connection with Swifties. The tour, a career-spanning celebration, combined nostalgia with innovation, inviting audiences to co-create and relive the magic online. In doing so, Swift has mastered her own very specific take on being “customer obsessed” in an era demanding constant creativity and engagement.
