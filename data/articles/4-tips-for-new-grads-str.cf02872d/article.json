    "If you\u2019re a new grad without a job lined up, you may be feeling anxious about the current market. During this time, it\u2019s useful to remember that the demand of labor is constantly fluctuating and varies between sectors. When the economy is in a lull, the job search can feel discouraging, but ultimately, such factors are out of your control. To stay motivated, it\u2019s helpful to remind yourself that it\u2019s not a reflection of your individual value or abilities. You can use this time post-graduation to reflect on what you really want upon entering the workforce and build out your network. Even if it takes you longer to land a job than you hope for, resume gaps are not as stigmatized as they used to be. The key is to frame them as purposeful and share what you learned during that time if a job interviewer brings it up.",
