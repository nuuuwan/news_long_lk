Over three decades ago, I was fortunate to be part of Sri Lanka’s telecom revolution, as founding MD of Mobitel — helping connect fishermen, farmers, and families far beyond Colombo. Back then, a simple mobile call could transform a fisherman’s daily catch into a better income, or help a rural family access vital information. It was a reminder that real progress often starts by giving people the tools to help themselves.

Today, the world has changed dramatically. I have spent much of my life in the telecom and technology sectors, helping roll out mobile networks not just in Sri Lanka but across Asia — from India and Bangladesh to Myanmar. Technology continues to move at lightning speed, and now we stand on the threshold of another profound leap forward: artificial intelligence.

AI might be controversial, but when used wisely, it can become a powerful tool for good. One area where it can have an immediate, practical impact in Sri Lanka is in bridging the English-speaking gap.

Anyone who travels across this country will see firsthand the hunger for growth and opportunity, especially among young people, informal workers, and small businesses who stand to gain the most from the surge in tourism, trade, and global connectivity.

Yet one barrier persists: spoken English.

Many Sri Lankans can read or write some English, but struggle with confidence when it comes to real conversation. Whether it’s a tuk-tuk driver, a hotel worker, a small B&B owner, or a police officer helping a tourist, the difference that clear communication makes is huge.

If we want to truly unlock Sri Lanka’s potential, we must tackle this gap head-on.

Teaching to fish, not giving a fish

With that goal in mind, I decided that my next chapter should focus on giving back in a meaningful way. Inspired by my own experiences and by the age-old wisdom that it is better to “teach a person to fish than to give them a fish,” I set up the Selvern Trust to invest in education-focused initiatives that empower people — not just for today, but for life.

The result is SELVE, the Speak English Language Very Easily app. Using the latest AI conversational tools, SELVE is designed to be an always-available practice partner for everyday Sri Lankans who want to learn spoken English in a safe, private, and practical way.

The SELVE app does more than just translate words, it coaches you. The lessons start with familiar, everyday topics: family, daily life, jobs, and common interactions. AI app holds a simple conversation with the user, listens to how you respond, corrects pronunciation, and gives feedback, encouraging you to try again until you gain confidence.

By practicing for as little as an hour a day, people who are hesitant to speak in public can build fluency in the privacy of their homes. We expect that most people will see significant improvement in just four to six weeks.

We are using robust, globally tested AI from Google, but training it specifically for the local context with practical, Sri Lankan everyday speech in mind. This is made possible through partnerships with three local institutions: Perfectus, who manage the technical development; Rainbow Institute, which brings in-depth English language expertise; and Headstart, a leader in local digital learning.

A small cost for a big step forward

One lesson I have learned throughout my career is that people value what they invest in. Free apps often go unused; commitment is missing. That’s why SELVE will have a small subscription fee, just enough to cover the operational costs of maintaining the AI platform and to encourage users to see the value in dedicating time each day to practice.

This is not about profit. It is about impact. I am not seeking to recover my investment, but to see real, lasting change for the tuk-tuk driver who can earn a bigger tip by communicating better, the bed-and-breakfast owner who can offer a warmer welcome to foreign guests, the tuk-tuk driver who services the tourist sector, or the tourist police themselves or the young jobseeker who can open new doors with confidence.

My hope is that SELVE will help thousands of Sri Lankans; especially those who feel stuck to find their voice. With better spoken English, more people can participate in our growing tourism sector, find better work opportunities, and connect more meaningfully with the wider world.

This journey takes me back to where it all began: using technology not just to connect calls, but to connect people to better opportunities and brighter futures.

Sri Lanka’s greatest resource is its people; resilient, hardworking, and eager to grow. By unlocking the power of language, we can unlock a better tomorrow for all.
