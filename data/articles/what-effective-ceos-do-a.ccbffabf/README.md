We often focus our attention on the first 90 days of a CEO’s tenure — and for good reason, as a successful first 90 days establishes a strong foundation for the months and years to come. But it’s often the period afterwards that can make or break a CEO’s impact on the transformation of an organization. Together, six actions become a system of thinking and doing that sustains progress, creates profitable growth opportunities, and builds a more capable organization: 1) Communicate what you value and want to change; 2) show how much the work matters; 3) anchor the growth strategy on customer lives; 4) create the organization of the future; 5) remove legacy and bureaucracy; and 6) encourage people to speak up and take responsibility.

The first 90 days of your new CEO role have come to an end. You’ve identified the strategic issues, delivered quick wins, and put out fires. The focus of the next period is on exploring growth opportunities and building the new organization. What could possibly go wrong?
