    "While he was brilliant in his studies, Amal was always one to experience things to explore, be exposed to different cultures and was in no way someone who enjoyed being buried with his books! But his intelligence and abilities ensured he got his undergraduate degree at LSE and returned to Sri Lanka whilst we in Colombo had barely completed our A\u2019 Levels at Royal",
    "Amal leaves behind him a masterclass in humility, caring, devotion and passion",
    "23 July 2024 marked one year since my friend Amal\u2019s untimely demise. For those who knew Amal, he was a deeply private person. Amal was not guarded with his privacy because he was necessarily shy or not social \u2013 he was just a very private person and what mattered to him was caring for the people he loved. He was a man content with the hand that life had dealt him and was never one to trumpet his own achievements.",
    "I was in two minds whilst writing this, contemplating whether Amal would have even wanted an appreciation or the sharing of what is penned down here. And it is the same with Ayoma, his beloved wife, whose thoughts and beliefs were so in sync with those of Amal\u2019s, which is what made them the perfect couple and partners in life. Having cleared the publication of writing this appreciation with Ayo, I felt I needed to share Amal\u2019s story as I know it \u2013 his beliefs, his way of life.",
    "The intent is not to set out his achievements but to show how someone, in what was an unfortunately short life, had so many impacts on the people around him; the humility he maintained despite his many achievements, how much care and compassion he had for those around him and beyond. These virtues and examples are lessons for all of us who had the benefit of knowing him. Although I may not in any way be ever able to fully describe the kind, humble, person Amal was, my intent of sharing this is so that we may reflect on the impact he had on our lives and be able to take away something from it to help better ourselves and the people around us, as it were.",
    "I knew Amal from our early years in school at Royal College. I was later to find out that we were not only born a day apart, but that we were also born at the same nursing home \u2013 just one room away! Our connection through our days at Royal was built on many facets and I cannot place one single reason for our strong bond. He was one of the early bloomers and left Royal in Grade 10 following his excellent results in the O\u2019 Levels. Although he left school early, we were in touch continuously \u2013 this too in an era with no mobile phones. He would cycle occasionally to my place or we would meet up at his house.",
    "While he was brilliant in his studies, Amal was always one to experience things to explore, be exposed to different cultures and was in no way someone who enjoyed being buried with his books! But his intelligence and abilities ensured he got his undergraduate degree at LSE and returned to Sri Lanka whilst we in Colombo had barely completed our A\u2019 Levels at Royal!",
    "To most people, Amal was a profoundly serious individual. For those who knew him well, he was quietly mischievous, loved hatching devious (but innocent) pranks and executing them with hilarious results. He would have so much fun and laugh at seeing those elaborate plans come through.",
    "When Amal met Ayoma for the first time at a 31st night party, he was completely and truly smitten, and wanted to be introduced. This resulted in numerous calls he and I had with hours of discussing and strategising as to how he should approach Ayo after the event, given there were two sets of mutual friends who knew Ayo. Amal, of course, had to consider the multiple possible strategies he could adopt, the risks of each, and how he could make it seem casual and unplanned. The list goes on. As we all know, all his scenarios and evaluations did end up with a positive and happy outcome. His meticulous planning of something like a surprise party for Ayo went beyond his usual social life. It was what made him the successful entrepreneur he was. Always planning multiple scenarios. Detailed plans for each scenario. Willing to take risks and take action at the right time.",
    "Amal was never a conformist. Despite his unassuming and easy-going manner, he also knew exactly what he did and didn\u2019t want. This was so in his personal life and his professional life. This made things hard at times when it came to trivial things like convincing him to come on a trip or attend a party which he simply didn\u2019t want to. While he could have landed any corporate job and made a tremendous career in the corporate field, he was an entrepreneur and a pioneer at heart. He wanted to make a difference and have an impact on how things worked, to change the way the capital markets worked. Amal\u2019s way of achieving this outcome was not to make that change through the corporate world \u2013 a harder task to achieve change, perhaps, but also the relatively safer approach to life.",
    "We had many debates on the merits of each, but it was clear his heart was in setting up his own firm \u2013 a truly independent research firm \u2013 where he could shape and influence the manner in which research was done, where he could create a market for research which did not exist at the time, where he could develop young talent in a structured, corporate manner but developing their leadership and skills with his entrepreneurial approach. While this journey had many challenges, of which I am sure only a very few knew the details, I am certain that both Amal and Ayo can be proud of what Frontier Research has achieved and continues to still successfully do.",
    "Despite Amal\u2019s success in creating Frontier Research and his unparalleled recognition in the finance and economics fields, the integrity, humility and simplicity he demonstrated in the light of these successes, epitomised the person we all knew. Early in his career, he decided he didn\u2019t want to wear a tie for meetings or corporate attire, for that matter. He just wanted to take the \u2018clutter\u2019 out \u2013 such as what he should wear for meetings and decided to be his own person. Hence, a bunch of white linen shirts as a nod to our tropical climate, which he subsequently expanded to include a few colours! Amal never went after accolades (well, he frankly didn\u2019t need to!) but he never let any of the trappings of that get to him. He was absolutely focused on doing what he loved, developing his team, making a difference to the country and corporates through his insightful and forthright research.",
    "While many may not know this, Amal found the pandemic period difficult to handle. Not due to lockdowns or other issues, nor concerns over business, but the impact his advice and research could have on those relying on guidance, given how volatile and unprecedented the macro landscape was. The fact that his advice could affect corporate decisions in what was a very difficult time in Sri Lanka, deeply disturbed him. Those around him advised Amal that his views and insights were still valued and anyone taking his advice on board had to be cognisant of the environment and not only on his research recommendations.",
    "But, this was Amal. His caring for his clients went beyond the contractual relationship. He cared so deeply about the impact that it sadly affected him fundamentally. The number of corporate leaders and finance industry professionals present to pay their respects to Amal on his passing, amply demonstrates the wide and far reaching impact he had on corporates in Sri Lanka and leadership at the boardroom level.",
    "Amal leaves behind him a masterclass in humility, caring, devotion and passion. One cannot do justice with a simple appreciation for everything Amal was as a person. His impact on my own life goes beyond bounds. The endless chats we used to have on politics, the economy, and so many random things about life in general are one of the things I will miss in untold ways.",
    "You were with us for way too little time, Amal. But know that you have made all of us around you, far better people. Taking away a little of what we have seen and learnt from you will help those around you to care for and impact society in better ways. Ayo, Eran, Aunty Indira and Uncle Nimal \u2013 no one can imagine how difficult the past year would have been for all of you. But you have all shown tremendous resilience in dealing with Amal\u2019s untimely demise. While it does not bring Amal back, his ways of life, selflessness, humility and integrity are things that will live beyond him.",
    "Regardless of our faiths or beliefs, I am deeply comforted by knowing that Amal is definitely in a place where his life on earth will be reflected in his journey beyond. Rest in peace, my beloved friend. You will never be forgotten and will always be remembered through your kind and loving deeds."
