    "What\u2019s happened?The survival of the regime of the president, Bashar al-Assad, hangs in the balance following the fall of most of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second city, into the hands of opposition forces. It was the most significant gain by opposition groups since Russia\u2019s intervention in 2015 turned the tide of the conflict in Mr Assad\u2019s favour. Although the Syrian regime was dramatically enfeebled by the rebel assault, we still consider the wholesale collapse of the regime an unlikely prospect in the near term.Why does it matter?The\u00a0opposition assault, which began on November 27th and was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, an armed Salafi group), is expanding rapidly in the face of limited resistance by regime forces.\u00a0HTS has capitalised on the\u00a0weakening of regime defences\u00a0in northern Syria, with most of the Syrian military there composed of conscripts and less-experienced units. Meanwhile, the\u00a0redeployment\u00a0of Iranian and allied Lebanese militia forces to Lebanon to confront Israel\u2019s incursion at the start of October has further weakened the regime\u2019s position. Most of Aleppo, along with its international airport and the Kuweiris airbase on the eastern outskirts, is now under the control of HTS, which faced minimal casualties during its takeover. The ease with which the rebels captured Aleppo highlights their strategic advantage.\u00a0In addition, rebel forces have successfully recaptured towns along the south-eastern border of the province of Idlib, including Sarakib and Maarat Naaman. With control over a section of the M5, Syria\u2019s main north-south highway, HTS is now positioned on the outskirts of Hama, another major government-held\u00a0city.Despite the unprecedented gains made by HTS, alongside the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, we expect that the rebels\u2019 momentum will slow.\u00a0The Syrian army has regrouped around Hama, with the support of more experienced and loyal units, in order to slow the HTS advance. Its position will be reinforced by the addition of Iranian-backed groups from elsewhere in Syria, notably the Afghan-dominated Fatimiyoun, and Popular Mobilisation Forces militias from Iraq. Russia and the Syrian air force have meanwhile stepped up air strikes on HTS positions, both those recently captured and those in the rebel heartland surrounding the city of Idlib, which will probably delay any plans to organise a fresh push into the\u00a0south.Even if Hama were to fall to the rebels, making further gains would be increasingly difficult.\u00a0Homs and Damascus, Syria\u2019s capital, along with the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, would pose significant challenges to any rebel advance. These areas are the heartland of Mr\u00a0Assad\u2019s Alawite sect, where fears of sectarian violence from the Salafi HTS could galvanise the local population to support the regime. Moreover, Latakia and Tartous are home to Russia\u2019s main military bases, and Iran and Hizbullah (a Lebanese Iranian-backed Shia Islamist political group) have concentrated their forces around Homs and Damascus.In addition, there is a persistent risk of intra-rebel clashes in recently captured territories, which would undermine HTS\u2019s momentum.\u00a0Although HTS has so far avoided direct contact with the SNA and the SDF in Aleppo, the SNA has engaged SDF-held position to the north-east of the city, reflecting Turkey\u2019s objectives to curb the spread of Kurdish influence near its border. Any fighting between these factions could draw HTS into the conflict, diverting crucial military resources away from its new front lines against the regime.What next?Clashes are expected to continue along the new front lines near Hama and in southern Aleppo province in the medium term,\u00a0although we believe that significant rebel gains that could fundamentally threaten the regime are improbable.\u00a0However, the government is unlikely to reverse the recent advances made by the rebels because of the weakness of Syrian army as an offensive force, especially without considerable support from Russia, Iran, Hizbullah and other key allies, which we do not expect to be forthcoming. The recent campaign has left the government weakened, shattering perceptions of regime stability and making Mr\u00a0Assad more vulnerable to internal challenges, as shown by reports of clashes within the army in Damascus on November\u00a030th. Although we currently assess that a military coup is unlikely, these recent developments have significantly undermined Mr\u00a0Assad\u2019s prospects of extending his regime beyond the end of his current presidential term in\u00a02028.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
