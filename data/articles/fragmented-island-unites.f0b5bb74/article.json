    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at a political rally in Jaffna",
    "For the first time in history, Sri Lankans have demonstrated a noteworthy advancement in political literacy, with all three communities rejecting divisive politics.",
    "In Thursday\u2019s elections, the NPP secured 61.56% of the total vote, marking a significant increase from the 42.2% they achieved previously. This surge was driven by 1.2 million former SJB, NDF and minority party voters (from the previous 7 million), who shifted their support to the NPP. Meanwhile, only 2.4 million votes went to the rest on 14th; others abstained from voting altogether.",
    "It signals a broader mandate and provides a stronger foundation as they move forward in governing the nation. Anyone engaging in excessive lamentation or dramatic expressions of grief over Thursday\u2019s election victory should consider this a long-overdue wake-up call. This outcome, while stirring emotions, is a consequence of dynamics set in motion seventy five years ago. The delay in addressing underlying issues has only compounded the situation, making this victory almost inevitable for those closely observing the political landscape. The country not only endorsed their presidential victory back in September but also demonstrated its growing support by significantly improving upon that performance.",
    "This is not just a victory for a single party\u2014it is a great victory for the entire nation. For years, past elections, while yielding victories for various administrations, were often won without a mandate from the North and the East, nation divided on ethnicity, a situation that remained a source of concern for the unity and stability of the country. The people have witnessed the unthinkable\u2014nine more than the \u2018unachievable\u2019 150-seat mark set by J.R. Jayewardene in 1978, a benchmark long deemed insurmountable, shattered by a single party in this election. This remarkable feat underscores a seismic shift in voter sentiment and the unparalleled momentum of a political movement that has defied historical precedents. It is a testament to the electorate\u2019s readiness to break away from traditional patterns and embrace change on an unprecedented scale.",
    "[In the 1994 Presidential election, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga secured a sweeping victory with 62.28% of the vote, [influenced in part by the assassination of her opponent, winning every district, and all electorates except Mahiyangana, and helped by poor voter turnout --a mere 2.9%\u00a0 in the Jaffna district. The northern regions, historically outside the reach of Southern political parties, had remained largely indifferent or opposed to the traditional power centers. However, in this election, that trend has been decisively altered. The north, once a stronghold of political resistance, has shifted its stance, signaling a dramatic change in voter behavior.",
    "The election result signifies the end of blind allegiance to political parties, the dismantling of mythological divisions that have long perpetuated societal divides, and the fading away of the last remnants of feudalistic systems that thrived on serving the powerful in exchange for favours.",
    "It would be a mistake to assume that no democratic progress emerged from this outcome. On the contrary, the election represents a significant step forward in reshaping the political landscape. It has shattered the traditional elite\u2019s arrogant presumption that Colombo\u2019s upper echelons could unilaterally determine what was best for the masses, while manipulating public perception with ease. This result underscores a heightened political consciousness and a collective assertion of agency among ordinary citizens, marking a decisive rejection of the entrenched dominance and privilege of a self-serving few. What we see today are the consequences of that failed thinking.",
    "Weary of Colours, Symbols and Families",
    "This was a vote cast by an electorate weary of hollow democratic labels that delivered little to improve their everyday lives while simultaneously dismissing them as unsophisticated, uneducated, and probably dim-witted.\u00a0 \u00a0Thursday\u2019s polls signify a seismic shift in the political dynamic. The old system of loyalties\u2014\u201dkapuwath kola, kapuwath nil, kapuwath rathu\u201d\u2014a cyclical allegiance to traditional political parties and their symbols, has lost its hold over the electorate. These familiar affiliations, which once dictated voter behaviour through entrenched tribalism and identity politics, have been rendered obsolete. The electorate has signaled a resounding rejection of these outdated paradigms, refusing to be confined by party colours or symbols. Instead, they have demonstrated a clear desire for substantive change, one that aligns with their pressing realities and addresses the systemic failures that have long been ignored. This election underscores a watershed moment where the people prioritise pragmatic solutions over blind loyalty.",
    "The SLPP and the SJB emerged as a result of the internal rifts between leaders and the new ambitious leaders of the once-mighty SLFP and UNP that ruled this nation since its independence 76 years ago slicing away a substantial portion for their own interests.\u00a0 Did these parties truly believe that after decades of grievous missteps\u2014both in internal governance and national policy\u2014their constituents would blindly continue to vote for them merely because of their historic names? Or that the electorate\u2019s growing disillusionment could be pacified by clever legal maneuvers, backstabbing alliances, or the adroit manipulations of a cunning few?",
    "The answer has become glaringly evident. The public\u2019s sheer disgust, fueled by an unbroken cycle of failure after failure and betrayal upon betrayal of their trust, has reached a breaking point. The electorate has decisively rejected the entitlement and arrogance of these parties, demanding accountability and signaling that brand loyalty alone is no longer sufficient. The collapse of the old guard, with its hollow promises and calculated power plays, is a reckoning long in the making\u2014and perhaps, a necessary step toward genuine renewal\u2026",
    "The JVP/NPP has firmly established its presence in Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape, leaving a significant imprint on the nation\u2019s democratic framework. Thursday\u2019s election results further underscored the party\u2019s evolving, multi-dimensional approach to governance and representation. Among the most notable developments was the inclusion of new parliamentarians from diverse fields, particularly academics and intellectuals, who bring fresh perspectives and expertise to the national discourse. One standout achievement came from Premier Harini Amarasuriya, who initially polled over 600,000 preference votes, setting a new record. However, her lead lasted only a few hours before being surpassed by Vijitha Herath, with 700,000. This shift emphasizes the value of political experience, highlighting the contrast between seasoned leadership and political amateurism.",
    "Daunting Task Fraught with Challenges",
    "For now, the new government is fully entitled to relish the fruits of their remarkable victory. Having won the confidence of a large majority of the country, they now bear the responsibility of fulfilling the trust placed in them by the electorate. The party\u2019s sweeping electoral victory has only heightened the people\u2019s aspirations, placing immense pressure on the government to deliver. This sets the stage for a precarious political challenge. The task ahead of them is undeniably daunting, fraught with challenges that will test their resolve at every turn. Yet, with hope comes high expectation, and often\u2014more frequently than not. They understand that the weight of their promises will not be carried lightly. All of the 61 percent are not their supporters, a good share being floating voters who hold them accountable for every action, or inaction, as the new government sets out to navigate the complex terrain of governance."
