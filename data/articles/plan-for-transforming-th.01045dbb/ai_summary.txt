The Sri Lankan government has proposed an economic transformation bill, which aims to prevent future economic collapses and is scheduled to be reviewed by Parliament soon. This is part of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s implementation of the Growth Lab Approach, a system developed by the Centre for International Development at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. The methodology calls for a series of discussions among government ministers, officials, subject matter experts and key private sector representatives to address any obstacles to investment and projects. Outcomes from these discussions will be shared with the public for feedback under the title "Open Day". The President has also promised to provide regular updates on reform and reorganisation programs. However, the writer concludes that the economic transformation bill lacks public engagement and consensus building, and thus may fail to bind future governments to its quantitative goals and may not achieve Sri Lanka’s long-term growth aspirations.
