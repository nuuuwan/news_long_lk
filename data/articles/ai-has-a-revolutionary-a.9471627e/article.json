    "Humans have relied on generalizations forever as a mental shortcut \u2014 and a way of running a business efficiently. But just as advancements in AI are making it possible to move beyond a handful of customer personas to infinitely personalizable products and messaging, they are also revealing to us a broader world full of ever-changing unique detail.

For example, businesses design campaigns for market segments, or create three, 10, or \u2014 amazing! \u2014 50 personas.",
