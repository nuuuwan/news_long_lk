    "Everyone struggles to manage their emotions at times. It\u2019s normal to have negative feelings and we can\u2019t expect ourselves \u2013 or others \u2013 to leave those behind just because we\u2019re at work. But those negative emotions can be detrimental to our relationships, performance, focus, and overall well-being. So it\u2019s worthwhile to hone our emotional intelligence skills that help us handle negative feelings. The author shares three simple approaches to enhance three specific aspects of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, and positive connections. These exercises include: assessment of bodily sensations, cognitive load, and emotional states; strategic breathing exercises; and authentic, intentional acts of kindness and understanding.",
