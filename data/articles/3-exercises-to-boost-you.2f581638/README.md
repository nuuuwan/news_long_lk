Everyone struggles to manage their emotions at times. Itâ€™s normal to have negative feelings and we canâ€™t expect ourselves â€“ or others â€“ to leave those behind just because weâ€™re at work. But those negative emotions can be detrimental to our relationships, performance, focus, and overall well-being. So itâ€™s worthwhile to hone our emotional intelligence skills that help us handle negative feelings. The author shares three simple approaches to enhance three specific aspects of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, and positive connections. These exercises include: assessment of bodily sensations, cognitive load, and emotional states; strategic breathing exercises; and authentic, intentional acts of kindness and understanding.

Have you ever reacted to a situation at work in a way you werenâ€™t proud of? Or sent an email when you were upset that you later regretted?Â No matter how successful or accomplished we may be, weÂ allÂ struggle with managing our emotions at times â€” and suffer the consequences afterward.
