Sam Dillavou, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, is developing an energy-efficient circuit composed of a network of resistors that can perform simple machine learning tasks. The system successfully classified iris flowers into three species, a linear classification problem, based on properties such as petal length and width. The novelty lies in encoding data on a voltage scale, rather than the traditional binary approach used in GPUs. Although currently less efficient than digital chips, Dillavou believes that scaling up the analog circuit will increase its computational power and energy efficiency. The "neuromorphic" design, modelling bottom-up information processing as seen in the brain, could present another energy-saving advantage over digital computers. Despite interest in the energy-efficient aspect of the design, it remains in a prototype phase.
