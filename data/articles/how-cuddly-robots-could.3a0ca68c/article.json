To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here.\u00a0 Last week, I scoured the internet in search of a robotic dog. I wanted a belated birthday present for my aunt, who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Studies suggest that having a companion animal can stave off some of the loneliness, anxiety, and agitation that come with Alzheimer\u2019s. My aunt would love a real dog, but she can\u2019t have one.  That\u2019s how I discovered the Golden Pup from Joy for All. It cocks its head. It sports a jaunty red bandana. It barks when you talk. It wags when you touch it. It has a realistic heartbeat. And it\u2019s just one of the many, many robots designed for people with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia. This week on The Checkup, join me as I go down a rabbit hole. Let\u2019s look at the prospect of\u00a0 using robots to change dementia care.",
    "As robots go, Golden Pup is decidedly low tech. It retails for $140. For around $6,000 you can opt for Paro, a fluffy robotic baby seal developed in Japan, which can sense touch, light, sound, temperature, and posture. Its manufacturer says it develops its own character, remembering behaviors that led its owner to give it attention.\u00a0\u00a0 Golden Pup and Paro are available now. But researchers are working on much more\u00a0 sophisticated robots for people with cognitive disorders\u2014devices that leverage AI to converse and play games. Researchers from Indiana University Bloomington are tweaking a commercially available robot system called QT to serve people with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. The researchers\u2019 two-foot-tall robot looks a little like a toddler in an astronaut suit. Its round white head holds a screen that displays two eyebrows, two eyes, and a mouth that together form a variety of expressions. The robot engages people in\u00a0 conversation, asking AI-generated questions to keep them talking.",
    "The AI model they\u2019re using isn\u2019t perfect, and neither are the robot\u2019s responses. In one awkward conversation, a study participant told the robot that she has a sister. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d the robot responded. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d But as large language models improve\u2014which is happening already\u2014so will the quality of the conversations. When the QT robot made that awkward comment, it was running Open AI\u2019s GPT-3, which was released in 2020. The latest version of that model, GPT-4o, which was released this week, is faster and provides for more seamless conversations. You can interrupt the conversation, and the model will adjust.\u00a0\u00a0 The idea of using robots to keep dementia patients engaged and connected isn\u2019t always an easy sell. Some people see it as an abdication of our social responsibilities. And then there are privacy concerns. The best robotic companions are personalized. They collect information about people\u2019s lives, learn their likes and dislikes, and figure out when to approach them. That kind of data collection can be unnerving, not just for patients but also for medical staff. Lillian Hung, creator of the Innovation in Dementia care and Aging (IDEA) lab at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, told one reporter about an incident that happened during a focus group at a care facility.\u00a0 She and her colleagues popped out for lunch. When they returned, they found that staff had unplugged the robot and placed a bag over its head. \u201cThey were worried it was secretly recording them,\u201d she said. Related StoryRobots that teach autistic kids social skills could help them developIn recent years, advancements in socially-assistive robots have opened up a promising new way for more affordable and personalized care. On the other hand, robots have some advantages over humans in talking to people with dementia. Their attention doesn\u2019t flag. They don\u2019t get annoyed or angry when they have to repeat themselves. They can\u2019t get stressed.\u00a0  What\u2019s more, there are increasing numbers of people with dementia, and too few people to care for them. According to the latest report from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, we\u2019re going to need more than a million additional care workers to meet the needs of people living with dementia between 2021 and 2031. That is the largest gap between labor supply and demand for any single occupation in the United States. Have you been in an understaffed or poorly staffed memory care facility? I have. Patients are often sedated to make them easier to deal with. They get strapped into wheelchairs and parked in hallways. We barely have enough care workers to take care of the physical needs of people with dementia, let alone provide them with social connection and an enriching environment.  \u201cCaregiving is not just about tending to someone\u2019s bodily concerns; it also means caring for the spirit,\u201d writes Kat McGowan in this beautiful Wired story about her parents\u2019 dementia and the promise of social robots. \u201cThe needs of adults with and without dementia are not so different: We all search for a sense of belonging, for meaning, for self-actualization.\u201d If robots can enrich the lives of people with dementia even in the smallest way, and if they can provide companionship where none exists, that\u2019s a win.",
    "\u201cWe are currently at an inflection point, where it is becoming relatively easy and inexpensive to develop and deploy [cognitively assistive robots] to deliver personalized interventions to people with dementia, and many companies are vying to capitalize on this trend,\u201d write a team of researchers from the University of California, San Diego, in a 2021 article in Proceedings of We Robot. \u201cHowever, it is important to carefully consider the ramifications.\u201d Many of the more advanced social robots may not be ready for prime time, but the low-tech Golden Pup is readily available. My aunt\u2019s illness has been progressing rapidly, and she occasionally gets frustrated and agitated. I\u2019m hoping that Golden Pup might provide a welcome (and calming) distraction. Maybe\u00a0 it will spark joy during a time that has been incredibly confusing and painful for my aunt and uncle. Or maybe not. Certainly a robotic pup isn\u2019t for everyone. Golden Pup may not be a dog. But I\u2019m hoping it can be a friendly companion.

Karen Hao has the story.\u00a0 Japan is already using robots to help with elder care, but in many cases they require as much work as they save. And reactions among the older people they\u2019re meant to serve are mixed. James Wright wonders whether the robots are \u201ca shiny, expensive distraction from tough choices about how we value people and allocate resources in our societies.\u201d\u00a0 From around the web A tiny probe can work its way through arteries in the brain to help doctors spot clots and other problems. The new tool could help surgeons make diagnoses, decide on treatment strategies, and provide assurance that clots have been removed.
