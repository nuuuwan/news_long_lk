The Golden Pup from Joy for All and a fluffy robotic baby seal called Paro can act as robotic companions for people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, and more advanced versions are being developed. For instance, researchers from Indiana University Bloomington are developing a robot named QT, which uses AI to initiate and maintain conversations. Personalized robots collect data about a patient's preferences to enhance its interactions with them, but this raises concerns about privacy. There are fears AI-assisted robots could lead to relinquishing care of dementia patients to machines. However, as the Alzheimer's Association warns, more than a million additional care workers will be needed by 2031 to meet demand, making a case for AI to fill this gap. Despite potential reservations, low-tech options like the Golden Pup are gaining popularity for their affordability and companionship.
