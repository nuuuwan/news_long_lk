It is reported that parents of the students, who sat for the exam, have made a complaint with the Human Rights Commission with regard to the issues connected to the Year Five Scholarship Exam question paper

Department of Examinations has launched a special investigation into the claims regarding the early release of the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam’s first question paper

One of the major reforms introduced during time of C.W.W Kannangara was the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination

Due to severe competition this exam is often the only opportunity for children from rural schools to gain admission to prestigious schools in the city

In 1931, the Donoughmore Constitution granted more authority to the natives over internal governance for the first time. As a result, Sri Lanka became the first country in Asia to be granted universal franchise in the same year. Representatives of the Constitutional Council were elected through voting. Under the State Council system, education was managed by an executive committee, with the chairman of this committee serving as the Minister of Education. C.W.W. Kannangara held this ministerial position, giving him the authority to implement numerous policy decisions in Sri Lanka’s education system.

C.W.W. Kannangara served as the Minister of Education from 1931 to 1947, a period known as the “Kannangara Era” due to his significant contributions to education. One of the major reforms introduced during this time was the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. The primary purpose of this exam was to provide equal educational opportunities to talented students from low-income families.

The scholarship exam was revised over time. During a meeting of the Education Executive Committee on February 10, 1942, resolutions were passed regarding how the scholarships should be held. The eligibility for the exam required students to have studied in a government or assisted school in an area where a Central College was located or a Central College or post primary class. Additionally, the family’s annual income had to be less than 600 rupees, and there was no age limit for exam candidates. In 1944, based on these qualifications, 40 students were awarded scholarships to study at a Central College. These students were selected from those who had studied in the area where the Central College was located. All recipients were required to live in residential accommodation. This marked the beginning of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.

The Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which began as described, has now become highly competitive. Due to this competition, it is often the only opportunity for children from rural schools to gain admission to prestigious schools in the city. For this reason, the exam is commonly referred to as the “Mother’s Exam,” as mothers are especially determined to help their children secure a place in a popular school through this scholarship, aiming to provide them with a quality education.

However, this year’s scholarship exam has run into much controversy. Allegations have emerged that the exam question paper was leaked before the test. As a result, the Department of Examinations has launched a special investigation into the claims regarding the early release of the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam’s first question paper. One specific accusation is that a government teacher who conducts tutoring classes in Alawwa included questions in his mock paper that were almost identical to those appearing on this year’s scholarship exam paper. Additionally, parents of students, who sat for the exam this year, claim that the same teacher shared that question paper in a social media group. That post is said to have been later deleted on the morning (September 15) of the exam, according to the complaint lodged by a group of parents with the Department of Examinations.

Controversial modal exam paper

Another allegation has surfaced regarding schools in the Kegalle district, where some had reportedly used a model question paper containing those questions. Three questions, strikingly similar to those in the first paper of the exam, were leaked prior to the examination. This has led parents to demand immediate action from the Department of Examinations. Furthermore, parents continued to claim that 11 questions in the model papers closely matched those in the first paper of this year’s scholarship examination.

It is also alleged that the essay in the question paper was exactly the same as one given in this model paper. Parents also claimed that this topic of essay had been taught to students in the North-Western Province. There is also a report about a tuition teacher in Alawwa who, for a fee of 2,500 rupees, taught the exam questions online on the night of September 14. Parents alleged that the same teacher presented the exam paper as a model paper to his students that Saturday night (September 14). This matter has been reported to the Criminal Investigation Department. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Education’s media division, it said that the Department of Examinations and the CID are conducting a joint investigation into the matter.

The Commissioner General of Examinations, Amith Jayasundara, said that an immediate investigation was launched in response to the complaints. On September 17, the panel of experts who contributed to preparing the exam, along with the relevant parties, were summoned for discussions. During the meeting, a decision was made regarding three of the questions in this year’s scholarship exam. A new scoring system was implemented removing the three questions. The Commissioner General clarified that these questions would be excluded and no candidates would be disadvantaged.

It was also reported that the first question paper of the scholarship exam was photographed before the exam began and sent to a group of teachers. As a result, the Department of Examinations took the assistant exam hall supervisor from an examination centre near Anuradhapura, along with five other teachers, in for questioning. The assistant hall supervisor reportedly took a photo of the first exam paper using his mobile phone and distributed it. The Commissioner General confirmed that the six teachers, including the assistant supervisor, were brought in by the Department of Examinations for questioning.

A group of individuals, including a principal from government schools in Anuradhapura and Nochchiyagama, were also accused for the same reason. Investigations have revealed that the leaked question paper was distributed to several areas, including Anuradhapura, Nochchiyagama, Colombo, and Kurunegala. This strongly suggests that the first paper of this year’s scholarship exam was entirely leaked. The release of 11 or 16 questions or the teaching of the entire paper online has caused a serious injustice to the students who worked hard in preparation for the exam.

The right of these children to study and fairly compete in the exam has been violated. In a system where everyone is entitled to a free education, the future of these children has been compromised by dishonest tutoring and individuals motivated by greed. As a result, parents protested in front of the Department of Examinations, strongly opposing the decision to remove only three questions from the first paper and adjust the scoring. They said that the entire paper had been leaked, not just the three questions. Parents have again raised their concerns with the Commissioner General of Examinations, claiming that this year’s exam paper was leaked not only through model papers but also via online teaching sessions.

This year, 323,879 students sat for the scholarship examination, and parents accused that their children’s rights were violated by the removal of only three questions. They alleged that the entire question paper was leaked through online messages exchanged after the exam, with a tuition teacher from the Warakapola area being implicated. Parents also claimed that the same teacher had revealed both English questions from last year’s scholarship exam before it took place.

As a result, parents believe this situation has caused significant injustice to the children who genuinely worked hard for the exam. If a child answered correctly the three questions that were removed, deducting their marks would be deeply unfair. Additionally, awarding full marks for these questions would also be unjust to other students. Therefore, the parents are calling for the entire exam to be cancelled and re-conducted, as it has been proven that the entire paper was leaked.

“We’re prepared to hold the examination again if necessary”-Jayasundara

“If anyone has strong evidence or facts to support canceling the paper, please provide them as soon as possible. While the three questions are not a 100 percent match with those in the exam paper, they will be removed, and evaluation work will be carried out”-Jayasundara

Examination Commissioner General Amith Jayasundara addressed the concerns regarding whether the Department of Examinations will fulfill the parents’ request or what steps will be taken next. He stated, “If it is further revealed that there is an issue with the grade five scholarship exam paper, appropriate action will be taken. I have spoken with the parents, and they are requesting the cancellation of the entire exam. If anyone has strong evidence or facts to support canceling the paper, please provide them as soon as possible. While the three questions are not a 100 percent match with those in the exam paper, they will be removed, and evaluation work will be carried out. Depending on the investigation reports, a cancellation or another resolution may follow. We are prepared to hold the examination again if necessary.”

We also attempted to speak with the tutor accused in this matter. When we called his phone number, a woman responded. However, when asked about the allegations against the tutor, she hung up.

Meanwhile, the Secretary of the Ministry of Education confirmed that the marking process of the scholarship exam papers has been temporarily halted until all investigations are completed and their findings are obtained.

Several arrests made regarding question paper leak

The CID has taken into custody a director of the National Institute of Education (NIA) on suspicion that he is connected with the leaking of some questions in paper one of the year five scholarship examination. The main reason for his arrest was because he served in the committee that was authorised to make the said question paper. This suspect was remanded till October 7 after being produced in the Kaduwela Magistrates Court.

Meanwhile, the tuition master, from Alawwa, who is also suspect in the leaking of this question paper, was also arrested by the CID on September 24.

An investigation team working under the supervision of the CID is probing the issue regarding the leaking of the question paper.

It is reported that parents of the students, who sat for the scholarship exam, had made a complaint with the Human Rights Commission with regard to the issues connected to the question paper. These complainants want of the exam conducted again.

Meanwhile, Teachers’ Association President Priyantha Fernando said that the investigations carried out against nine teachers from North Central Province, regarding the leaking of this question paper, have been stopped. Fernando pointed out that there is much pressure exerted on the authorities carrying out investigations into the leaking of the question paper by certain forces.
