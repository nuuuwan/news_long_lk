Latin American countries possess a vast amount of minerals crucial for the global energy transition, like lithium and copper, which are essential for technologies such as electric cars and electricity-intensive artificial intelligence operations. However, most Latin American countries have poor infrastructure and high operational risk. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the best-prepared countries to attract investments for these critical minerals are Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, while Bolivia, Cuba, Guatemala, and Panama rank poorly. The International Energy Agency predicts that the demand for these minerals will increase by more than 6% per year on average until 2030. Although Latin America has more than half of the world's lithium reserves, its global production share has been decreasing due to low investment in mining projects compared to other regions.
