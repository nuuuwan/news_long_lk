# Critical minerals in Latam: opportunities and challenges

## Summary ðŸ¤–

Latin American countries possess a vast amount of minerals crucial for the global energy transition, like lithium and copper, which are essential for technologies such as electric cars and electricity-intensive artificial intelligence operations. However, most Latin American countries have poor infrastructure and high operational risk. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the best-prepared countries to attract investments for these critical minerals are Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, while Bolivia, Cuba, Guatemala, and Panama rank poorly. The International Energy Agency predicts that the demand for these minerals will increase by more than 6% per year on average until 2030. Although Latin America has more than half of the world's lithium reserves, its global production share has been decreasing due to low investment in mining projects compared to other regions.


## Follow-up Questions ðŸ¤–

1. What specific steps can Latin American countries take to attract more investments in critical mineral mining?
2. Would lessening the permitting processes in some countries, like Chile, be beneficial to the mining sector?
3. How can the US and the EU effectively compete with China in accessing Latin America's critical minerals?
4. What has caused the decrease in Latin America's global production share in recent years?
5. Are there any specific mining projects that forecasters believe to be particularly promising in Latin America?
6. How have instances of social unrest and corruption impacted the mining industry in Latin America?
7. What are the potential implications for global technology advancement if the demand for critical minerals outpaces the supply?
8. How can countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic improve their regulatory environments to attract mining investors?
9. Why are Bolivia and Cuba hostile towards private investment in their critical mineral reserves? 
10. What is the nature of Panama's dispute with the Canadian company over the copper mine? 
11. How is Latin America's potential in the critical minerals sector compared to other regions in the world?

Critical minerals in Latam: opportunities and challenges

ForecastingAmericasCountry Analysis

As competition for access to critical minerals hots up between China, the US and the EU, investor attention is turning increasingly to Latin Americaâ€™s vast resources of lithium, copper, nickel and rareÂ earths.

These minerals are crucial for the global energy transition and for new technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), and electricity-intensive artificial intelligence operations and data centres, but Latin America will need to attract huge international mining investments to ramp up production and fulfil its development potential.

Most countries in Latin America suffer from poor infrastructure and relatively high operational risk, but large and unexplored reserves, coupled with low levels of geopolitical risk (due to the regionâ€™s location away from global conflict zones), make it an attractive destination for investors seeking reliable partners along the supply chain.

Within the region, the preparedness of resource-rich nations to take advantage of investment opportunities in critical minerals varies significantly. According to EIUâ€™s analysis, presented below in a critical-minerals readiness heatmap, the three Latin American countries that are best prepared to attract investments in this area are Chile, Argentina and Brazil. In contrast, Bolivia, Cuba, Guatemala and Panama perform poorly, with little scope for improvement in the near term.

Reflecting the sectorâ€™s attractiveness, the International Energy Agency (an intergovernmental organisation) forecasts that demand for critical minerals will increase by more than 6% per year on average until 2030. Investment in mining projects in Latin America will be crucial to satisfy this growing demand. The region is home to more than half of the worldâ€™s reserves of lithium, more than a third of its copper and nearly one-fifth of nickel and rare-earth metals, but its share of global production has been diminishing in recent years amid lacklustre investment in mining projects compared with some other regions.

The disparity between these bountiful reserves and low levels of investment can be traced back to an unstable regulatory environment in many countries in the region, as well as episodes of labour and social unrest and prevalent corruption. However, our comprehensive assessment of the business environment for critical minerals shows thatÂ the regionâ€™s huge, unexplored reserves largely compensate for these shortcomings, making many Latin American countries more opportune choices for investors than other major producer nations elsewhere in the world.

In our critical-minerals readiness heatmap, all of the regionâ€™s five major producer countries perform well.Â Chile comes out on top, owing to strong confidence in the sector, firm commitment to the rule of law, and high-quality labour and infrastructure. In terms of regulations, however, there is some cause for concern;Â permitting processes are onerous, and the current governmentâ€™s more statist approach towards critical minerals (especially lithium) weighs on our assessment. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Peru are also positioned well. They each have their own shortcomings, but there is still substantial potential for growth.

Investors may be less confident in tapping opportunities in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador, where significant political commitment to improve the regulatory environment for investment in critical minerals is needed and is unlikely to materialise within our 2024â€‘28 forecast period. A high risk of labour and social unrest is also a major deterrent to investors in these countries.

Guatemala, Panama, Cuba and Bolivia are poorly positioned to receive critical-mineral investments. In Cuba and Bolivia, this reflects hostile policies towards private investment, which are likely to remain in place for the entire outlook period. Meanwhile, Panamaâ€™s government is embroiled in a major dispute with a Canadian operator over its huge, mothballed copper mine, causing the countryâ€™s score to suffer.
