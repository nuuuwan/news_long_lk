    "It has been a grim few months for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) community. There had been some excitement when, a couple of years ago, a gene therapy for the disorder was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first time. That drug, Elevidys, has now been implicated in the deaths of two teenage boys. The drug\u2019s approval was always controversial\u2014there was a lack of evidence that it actually worked, for starters. But the agency that once rubber-stamped the drug has now turned on its manufacturer, Sarepta Therapeutics. In a remarkable chain of events, the FDA asked the company to stop shipping the drug on July 18. Sarepta refused to comply.

And that\u2019s worth the risk.",
    "In the days since, the company has acquiesced. But its reputation has already been hit. And the events have dealt a devastating blow to people desperate for treatments that might help them, their children, or other family members with DMD. DMD is a rare genetic disorder that causes muscles to degenerate over time. It\u2019s caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for a protein called dystrophin. That protein is essential for muscles\u2014without it, muscles weaken and waste away. The disease mostly affects boys, and symptoms usually start in early childhood.",
    "At first, affected children usually start to find it hard to jump or climb stairs. But as the disease progresses, other movements become difficult too. Eventually, the condition might affect the heart and lungs. The life expectancy of a person with DMD has recently improved, but it is still only around 30 or 40 years. There is no cure. It\u2019s a devastating diagnosis. Elevidys was designed to replace missing dystrophin with a shortened, engineered version of the protein. In June 2023,\u00a0the FDA approved the therapy for eligible four- and five-year-olds. It came with a $3.2 million price tag.",
    "The approval was celebrated by people affected by DMD, says Debra Miller, founder of CureDuchenne, an organization that funds research into the condition and offers support to those affected by it. \"We've not had much in the way of meaningful therapies,\" she says. \"The excitement was great.\" But the approval was controversial. It came under an \u201caccelerated approval\u201d program that essentially lowers the bar of evidence for drugs designed to treat \u201cserious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need.\u201d Elevidys was approved because it appeared to increase levels of the engineered protein in patients\u2019 muscles. But it had not been shown to improve patient outcomes: It had failed a randomized clinical trial. The FDA approval was granted on the condition that Sarepta complete another clinical trial. The\u00a0topline results of that trial were described in October 2023 and\u00a0were published in detail a year later. Again, the drug failed to meet its \u201cprimary endpoint\u201d\u2014in other words, it didn\u2019t work as well as hoped.  In June 2024, the FDA expanded the approval of Elevidys. It granted traditional approval for the drug to treat people with DMD who are over the age of four and can walk independently, and another accelerated approval for those who can\u2019t.

    "Some experts were appalled at the FDA\u2019s decision\u2014even some within the FDA disagreed with it. But things weren\u2019t so simple for people living with DMD. I spoke to some parents of such children\u00a0a couple of years ago. They pointed out that drug approvals can help bring interest and investment to DMD research. And, above all, they were desperate for any drug that might help their children. They were desperate for hope. Unfortunately, the treatment does not appear to be delivering on that hope. There have always been questions over whether it works. But now there are serious questions over how safe it is.\u00a0 In March 2025, a 16-year-old boy died after being treated with Elevidys. He had developed acute liver failure (ALF) after having the treatment, Sarepta\u00a0said in a statement. On June 15, the company\u00a0announced a second death\u2014a 15-year-old who also developed ALF following Elevidys treatment. The company said it would pause shipments of the drug,\u00a0but only for patients who are not able to walk.",
    "The following day, Sarepta held\u00a0an online presentation in which CEO Doug Ingram said that the company was exploring ways to make the treatment safer, perhaps by treating recipients with another drug that dampens their immune systems. But that same day, the company announced that\u00a0it was laying off 500 employees\u201436% of its workforce. Sarepta did not respond to a request for comment. On June 24, the FDA\u00a0announced that it was investigating the risks of serious outcomes \u201cincluding hospitalization and death\u201d associated with Elevidys, and \u201cevaluating the need for further regulatory action.\u201d There was more tragic news on July 18, when there were\u00a0reports that a third patient had died following a Sarepta treatment. This patient, a 51-year-old, hadn\u2019t been taking Elevidys but was enrolled in a clinical trial for a different Sarepta gene therapy designed to treat limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The same day,\u00a0the FDA asked Sarepta to voluntarily pause all shipments of Elevidys. Sarepta\u00a0refused to do so. The refusal was surprising, says Michael Kelly, chief scientific officer at CureDuchenne: \u201cIt was an unusual step to take.\u201d After\u00a0significant\u00a0media\u00a0coverage, including reporting that\u00a0the FDA was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the decision and would use its \u201cfull regulatory authority,\u201d Sarepta backed down a few days later. On July 21, the company announced its decision to\u00a0\u201cvoluntarily and temporarily\u201d pause all shipments of Elevidys in the US. Sarepta says it will now work with the FDA to address safety and labeling concerns. But in the meantime, the saga has left the DMD community grappling with \u201ca mix of disappointment and concern,\u201d says Kelly. Many are worried about the risks of taking the treatment. Others are devastated that they are no longer able to access it. Miller says she knows of families who have been working with their insurance providers to get authorization for the drug. \"It's like the rug has been pulled out from under them,\" she says. Many families have no other treatment options. \"And we know what happens when you do nothing with Duchenne,\" she says. Others, particularly those with teenage children with DMD, are deciding against trying the drug, she adds.  The decision over whether to take Elevidys was already a personal one based on several factors, he says. People with DMD and their families deserve clear and transparent information about the treatment in order to make that decision.",
    "The FDA's decision to approve Elevidys was made on limited data, says Kelly. But as things stand today, over 900 people have been treated with Elevidys. \"That gives the FDA... an opportunity to look at real data and make informed decisions,\" he says.  \u201cFamilies facing Duchenne do not have time to waste,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThey must navigate a landscape where hope is tempered by the realities of medical complexity.\u201d A version of this article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.
