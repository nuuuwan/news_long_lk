Facts:

- Gideon Rachman, columnist for Financial Times, presented two distinct ideas about the West’s position in global politics.
- Rachman said that the West needs to stop viewing its role as a defender of a rules-based international order and start seeing itself as a champion of the ‘free world’.
- Rachman portrayed the far-right as a threat to Western democracies, arguing that its hostility to democracy and the rule of law could lead to violence and political intimidation.
- Rachman implied that moderate right-wing politicans like Marine Le Pen and Giorgia Meloni are reconciling with the political establishment, and unlike far-right leaders, could be removed from power in the next election.
- The commentator argued that Western democracies can defend against far-right threats at home while pursuing stability in international relations, regardless of whether this means supporting repressive regimes.
