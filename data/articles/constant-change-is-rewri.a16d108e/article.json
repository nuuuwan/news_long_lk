    "Let\u2019s face it: we are massively failing at change. According to research from Gartner published last May, employees\u2019 willingness to support enterprise change collapsed to just 43% in 2022, compared to 74% in 2016.

The report also included data that just broke my heart: a whopping 15% of employees worldwide are \u201dloudly quitting\u201d \u2014 \u201cdirectly harming the organization, undercutting its goals and opposing its leaders.\u201d",
