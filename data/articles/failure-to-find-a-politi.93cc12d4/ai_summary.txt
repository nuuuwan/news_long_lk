1. 📝The article reflects on the ethnic violence that occurred in Sri Lanka in July 1983, the event known as Black July. 📆
2. 🏚️Black July refers to the anti-Tamil pogrom spread across Sri Lanka, resulting in approximately 3000 deaths and significant destruction of property. 🏚️
3. 😔For many Tamils, the events were devastating, leading to mass migration from Sri Lanka to Western Europe, North America, and Australia, causing a dispersal similar to that of the Jewish diaspora. 🌍
4. 🔫Following an attack by Tamil Tigers that killed 13 Army men, a reaction of fierce violence was triggered across the nation. This event became the start of a destructive ethnic war. 💥
5. ✊The way the government handled the aftermath of Black July is critiqued. Rather than working towards a political solution, governments have focussed on a military solution. 👮
6. 🇮🇳The article touches on India's intervention in the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict resulting in the signing of the 1987 Indo-Lanka Peace Accord. This was a significant event in Indo-Sri Lanka relations. 👩‍🤝‍👨
7. 📝The signing of the accord was followed by the passing of the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution which introduced the Provincial Councils. Unfortunately, this did not bring a resolution to the national problem. 🏦
8. 🗣️Sri Lanka's principal political forces are still grappling with basic issues relating to the country's ethnic problem, more than 15 years after the end of the war and 40 years after Black July. ⏳
9. 💭The three main candidates in the upcoming Presidential Election have pledged to implement the 13th Amendment. However, their stance on provincial administration powers appears to be inconsistent. 💡
10. 🇱🇰Regrettably, Sri Lanka's political class has not learned from past experiences and continues to grapple with a solution to the national problem, making this a bigger shame than Black July. 🙇‍♂️
