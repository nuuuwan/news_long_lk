1. 🌍💼 Companies and entrepreneurs need to adapt their risk management frameworks to accommodate the changing climate, particularly in climate-vulnerable developing nations like Sri Lanka.
2. 🌳📖 Traditional enterprise risk management (ERM) has a strong focus on financial, operational and compliance risks. However, climate change necessitates incorporating environmental and social governance (ESG) criteria.
3. 🧭💡 ERM should consider the threats posed by climate change, including vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and sea-level rise. Deep understanding of supply chains and their potential exposure to climate impacts is crucial.
4. 🏭📊 Incorporating ESG criteria into ERM makes sure environmental and social impacts are considered in decision-making. This includes setting goals such as reducing carbon footprints and ensuring fair labor practices.
5. 💲💚 Achieving transformation in ERM requires not only the right resources but also funding, which can be challenging in developing countries. Green financing can support environmentally friendly and sustainable initiatives by providing low-interest loans, grants, and tax incentives.
6. 👩‍💻🚀 Technologies such as artificial intelligence, digitization, and the Internet of Things offer businesses new ways to monitor environmental impacts, predict climate-related risks, and optimize resource usage.
7. 🌿📏 Supportive regulatory frameworks are essential for a climate-smart business environment, including emission reduction targets and guidelines for sustainable practices.
8. 🧑‍🎓🔄 Entrepreneurs require specific skills and a risk-aware mindset to implement sustainable and climate-friendly ERM. Education and training play a pivotal role in this transformation.
9. 📚🌱 Embedding sustainability and climate resilience into formal education systems is necessary for long-term sustainable development.
10. 🇱🇰💪 If entrepreneurs in climate-vulnerable countries like Sri Lanka can innovate and navigate complex risks, it will pave the way for a more resilient and prosperous economy.
