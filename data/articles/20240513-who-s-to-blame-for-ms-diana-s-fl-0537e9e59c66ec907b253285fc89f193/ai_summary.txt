- British citizen Diana Gamage, not to be confused with Princess Diana, was unseated as a Sri Lankan Member of Parliament (MP) and State Minister.

- Diana, aged 60, was appointed a National List MP by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) after transferring control of Ape Jathika Peramuna (AJP) to SJB.

- Former Commissioner of Elections Mahinda Deshapriya clarified Sri Lankan law prevents non-citizens from becoming MPs or voting.

- AJP was founded by late MPs Mangala Samaraweera and Sripathi Sooriyarachchi after splitting from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

- Diana’s husband, Senaka de Silva, was previously an aide to General Sarath Fonseka, SJB’s current chairman.

- Questions arise over SJB's responsibility in nominating Diana without proper vetting.

- Diana entered Sri Lanka with a British passport, and there is no evidence of her Sri Lankan visa renewal post-2015.

- The Supreme Court verdict unseating Diana is welcomed yet raises concerns about insufficient deterrents for such offences.

- Highlighted issue of societal inequality: privileged members evade severe repercussions whereas underprivileged face harsh punishments.

- Call for accountability: suggestions include making those who exploit the system repay expenses and income received during their parliamentary tenure.
