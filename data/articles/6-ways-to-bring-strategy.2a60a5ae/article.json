    "Business leaders are expected to be strategic, and while organizational obstacles can prevent you from translating intent into strategic actions, so can your personal limitations and practices. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Even when it feels like the odds are stacked against you, you have more choices than you may realize. Small decisions about where to focus and what to do throughout your day may feel inconsequential, but their impacts accumulate. Master those small decisions and before you know it, you\u2019ll overcome the obstacles as you pursue your strategy with greater clarity, determination, and ultimately success. The author presents six ways to incorporate strategy into your daily practices.",
