Business leaders are expected to be strategic, and while organizational obstacles can prevent you from translating intent into strategic actions, so can your personal limitations and practices. It doesn’t have to be this way. Even when it feels like the odds are stacked against you, you have more choices than you may realize. Small decisions about where to focus and what to do throughout your day may feel inconsequential, but their impacts accumulate. Master those small decisions and before you know it, you’ll overcome the obstacles as you pursue your strategy with greater clarity, determination, and ultimately success. The author presents six ways to incorporate strategy into your daily practices.

Being strategic — that is, making a coherent set of choices to help you pursue an ambition or goal — is a nonnegotiable skill for business leaders. But it can be hard to practice, and strategies are notoriously hard to design and deliver. Sometimes we blame organizational obstacles. For example, micromanagement dampens enthusiasm for trying something new. Incentives encourage us to stick to the status quo. Poor communication makes it hard to know where to focus.
