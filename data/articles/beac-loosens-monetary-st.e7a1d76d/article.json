    "What\u2019s happened?At its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on March\u00a024th the Banque des Etats de l\u2019Afrique centrale (BEAC), the central bank of the Communaut\u00e9 \u00e9conomique et mon\u00e9taire de l\u2019Afrique centrale (CEMAC) region, cut its benchmark interest rate by 50\u00a0basis points, to 4.5%.\u00a0We expect a further rate cut later in 2025 as inflation trends downwards and\u00a0the BEAC seeks to boost liquidity conditions and support economic\u00a0activity.Why does it matter?Monetary loosening will support liquidity conditions for governments and banks\u00a0(which are heavily exposed to regional sovereigns through the regional debt market, with notable rollover risks). It will also boost non-oil economic activity (which has remained lacklustre in recent years, with regional growth dominated by the hydrocarbons sector) and credit to the private sector (which has been rising, albeit from a low base). The BEAC also continues to provide liquidity injections to support regional banks.\u00a0We expect regional economic growth to pick up slightly in 2025,\u00a0supported in part by expected monetary loosening, but driven largely by an uptick in hydrocarbons and mining\u00a0activity.Regional inflation averaged 4.1% in 2024, above the BEAC\u2019s target ceiling of 3%, although it has generally been trending downwards since late 2023. The BEAC expects inflation to continue moderating in 2025, and reach its 3% target ceiling by year-end.\u00a0We forecast that inflation will moderate in each of the six CEMAC member states in 2025 on the back of lower domestic food and energy prices, alongside modest currency appreciation over the\u00a0year.The BEAC\u2019s rate cut is supported by monetary loosening by the European Central Bank (ECB), which has instituted six rate cuts since June\u00a02024 (to 2.5% after its March MPC meeting) owing to slowing inflation and subdued economic activity in the euro zone. We expect the ECB to continue easing monetary policy in 2025, with its main policy rate falling to 1.75% at year-end, from 3% at end-2024. The interest-rate differential between the BEAC and the ECB reached a nadir in 2023. The ECB was able to maintain a tight monetary stance in order to tame inflation in the euro zone, but the BEAC\u2019s ability to raise its main policy rate was constrained by the need to avoid a liquidity crunch for governments and banks (even when inflation was rising persistently). However, foreign-exchange reserves in the CEMAC region are solid (at about 4.5\u00a0months), supported by oil\u00a0revenue.What next?We expect the BEAC to cut its main policy rate by a further 50\u00a0basis points later in 2025, to 4% by year-end. We also forecast that the ECB will enact deeper rate cuts than the BEAC (of a cumulative 125\u00a0basis points in 2025, compared with 100\u00a0basis points),\u00a0widening the interest-rate differential against 2024 levels (closer to the historical average) and bolstering the BEAC\u2019s foreign-reserves position.\u00a0This will improve regional liquidity conditions and support economic\u00a0activity.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
