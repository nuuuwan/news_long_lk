The UNP, United National Party, in Sri Lanka has suggested to hold a referendum in order to extend the term of the President and Parliament for two more years. This is reportedly driven by an election phobia of the UNP. However, several UNP leaders including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, have denied any agreement with this proposal. Opinions are divided as to whether this is a collective decision or a personal sentiment of the party’s General Secretary, Palitha Range Bandara.

Last year, a similar idea was floated by UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena, pointing to previous referendums that enabled more extended leadership terms. Abeywardena suggested that the extension would allow the UNP to successfully implement economic reforms alongside the IMF, World Bank, etc. Critics suggest that fear of election loss was a more significant motivator than economic planning. 

Additionally, a claim was made that the upcoming election’s estimated cost (13 billion Rs.) could be directed to benefit the public, such as reducing electricity tariffs if a national consensus agrees to keep President Wickremesinghe as the sole candidate. 

Deeper criticisms highlight the worsening economic state and the rising debt crisis under Wickremesinghe's leadership.

Meanwhile, opposition parties such Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya /National People’s Power (NPP) believe that regime change will not disrupt the IMF programme and consider the UNP's caution against regime change to be unfounded and baseless. 

The article expresses scepticism of the UNP's proposal, suggesting that it may simply repeat the controversial events of the 1982 referendum that extended the Parliament's term by six additional years. This involved an allegedly large-scale rigging, use of violence, and abuse of power.
