    "A previously unreported document distributed by senior US State Department official Darren Beattie reveals a sweeping effort to uncover all communications between the staff of a small government office focused on online disinformation and a lengthy list of public and private figures\u2014many of whom are longtime targets of the political right.\u00a0 The document, originally shared in person with roughly a dozen State Department employees in early March, requested staff emails and other records with or about a host of individuals and organizations that track or write about foreign disinformation\u2014including Atlantic journalist Anne Applebaum, former US cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, and the Stanford Internet Observatory\u2014or have criticized President Donald Trump and his allies, such as the conservative anti-Trump commentator Bill Kristol.\u00a0  The document also seeks all staff communications that merely reference Trump or people in his orbit, like Alex Jones, Glenn Greenwald, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In addition, it directs a search of communications for a long list of keywords, including \u201cPepe the Frog,\u201d \u201cincel,\u201d \u201cq-anon,\u201d \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d \u201cfar-right,\u201d and \u201cinfodemic.\u201d For several people who received or saw the document, the broad requests for unredacted information felt like a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d one official says\u2014one that could put the privacy and security of numerous individuals and organizations at risk.",
    "Beattie, whom Trump appointed in February to be the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, told State Department officials that his goal in seeking these records was a \u201cTwitter files\u201d-like release of internal State Department documents \u201cto rebuild trust with the American public,\u201d according to a State Department employee who heard the remarks. (Beattie was referring to the internal Twitter documents that were released after Elon Musk bought the platform, in an attempt to prove that the company had previously silenced conservatives. While the effort provided more detail on the challenges and mistakes Twitter had already admitted to, it failed to produce a smoking gun.)  \"What would be the innocent reason for doing that?\"~Bill Kristol  The document, dated March 11, 2025, focuses specifically on records and communications from the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub, a small office in the State Department\u2019s Office of Public Diplomacy that tracked and countered foreign disinformation campaigns; it was created after the Global Engagement Center (GEC), which had the same mission, shut down at the end of 2024. MIT Technology Review broke the news earlier this month that R/FIMI would be shuttered.",
    "Some R/FIMI staff were at the meeting where the document was initially shared, as were State Department lawyers and staff from the department\u2019s Bureau of Administration, who are responsible for conducting searches to fulfill public records requests.\u00a0 Also included among the nearly 60 individuals and organizations caught up in Beattie\u2019s information dragnet are Bill Gates; the open-source journalism outlet Bellingcat; former FBI special agent Clint Watts; Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister; Daniel Fried, a career State Department official and former US ambassador to Poland; Ren\u00e9e DiResta, an expert in online disinformation who led research at Stanford Internet Observatory; and Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who briefly led the Disinformation Governance Board at the US Department of Homeland Security.

When told of their inclusion in the records request, multiple people expressed alarm that such a list exists at all in an American institution. \u201cWhen I was in government I\u2019d never done anything like that,\u201d Kristol, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, says. \u201cWhat would be the innocent reason for doing that?\u201d Fried echoes this sentiment. \u201cI spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn\u2019t collect names or demand email records,\u201d says Fried. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing\u201d\u2014at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European \u201cCommunist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.\u201d\u00a0  He adds: \u201cIt also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.\u201d\u00a0 Targeting the \u201ccensorship industrial complex\u201d Both GEC and R/FIMI, its pared-down successor office, focused on tracking and countering foreign disinformation efforts from Russia, China, and Iran, among others, but GEC was frequently accused\u2014and was even sued\u2014by conservative critics who claimed that it enabled censorship of conservative Americans\u2019 views. A judge threw out one of those claims against GEC in 2022 (while finding that other parts of the Biden administration did exert undue pressure on tech platforms).\u00a0 Beattie has also personally promoted these views. Before joining the State Department, he started Revolver News, a website that espouses far-right talking points that often gain traction in certain conservative circles. Among the ideas promoted in Revolver News is that GEC was part of a \u201ccensorship industrial complex\u201d aimed at suppressing American conservative voices, even though GEC\u2019s mission was foreign disinformation. This idea has taken hold more broadly; the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing titled the \u201cCensorship-Industrial Complex: The Need for First Amendment Safeguards at the State Department,\u201d on April 1 focused on GEC.\u00a0 Most people on the list appear to have focused at some point on tracking or challenging disinformation broadly, or on countering specific false claims, including those related to the 2020 election. A few of the individuals appear primarily to be critics of Trump, Beattie, or others in the right-wing media ecosystem. Many have been the subject of Trump\u2019s public grievances for years. (Trump called Krebs, for instance, a \u201csignificant bad-faith actor\u201d in an executive order targeting him earlier this month.)",
    "Beattie specifically asked for \u201call documents, emails, correspondence, or other records of communications amongst/between employees, contractors, subcontractors or consultants at the GEC or R/FIMI\u201d since 2017 with all the named individuals, as well as communications that merely referenced them. He sought communications that referenced any of the listed organizations.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, he sought a list of additional unredacted agency records\u2014including all GEC grants and contracts, as well as subgrants, which are particularly sensitive due to the risks of retaliation to subgrantees, who often work in local journalism, fact-checking, or pro-democracy organizations under repressive regimes. It also asked for \u201call documents mentioning\u201d the Election Integrity Partnership, a research collaboration between academics and tech companies that has been a target of right-wing criticism.\u00a0 Several State Department staffers call the records requests \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cimproper\u201d in their scope. MIT Technology Review spoke to three people who had personally seen the document, as well as two others who were aware of it; we agreed to allow them to speak anonymously due to their fears of retaliation.\u00a0 While they acknowledge that previous political appointees have, on occasion, made information requests through the records management system, Beattie\u2019s request was something wholly different.\u00a0  Never had \u201can incoming political appointee\u201d sought to \u201csearch through seven years\u2019 worth of all staff emails to see whether anything negative had been said about his friends,\u201d says one staffer.\u00a0 Another staffer calls it a \u201cpet project\u201d for Beattie.\u00a0 Selective transparency Beattie delivered the request, which he framed as a \u201ctransparency\u201d initiative, to the State Department officials in a conference room at its Washington, D.C., headquarters on a Tuesday afternoon in early March, in the form of an 11-page packet titled, \u201cSO [Senior Official] Beattie Inquiry for GEC/R/FIMI Records.\u201d The documents were printed out, rather than emailed. Labeled \u201csensitive but unclassified,\u201d the document lays out Beattie\u2019s requests in 12 separate, but sometimes repetitive, bullet points. In total, he sought communications about 16 organizations, including Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center and the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), as well as with and about 39 individuals.",

    "Notably, this includes several journalists: In addition to Bellingcat and Applebaum, the document also asks for communications with NBC News senior reporter Brandy Zadrozny.\u00a0 Press-freedom advocates expressed alarm about the inclusion of journalists on the list, as well as the possibility of their communications being released to the public, which goes \u201cconsiderably well beyond the scope of what \u2026 leak investigations in the past have typically focused on,\u201d says Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Rather, the effort seems like \u201ca tactic designed to \u2026 make it much harder for journalists to strike up those source relationships in the first instance.\u201d",
    "Beattie also requested a search for communications that mentioned Trump and more than a dozen other prominent right-leaning figures. In addition to Jones, Greenwald, and \u201cRFK Jr.,\u201d the list includes \u201cDon Jr.,\u201d Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk, Marine Le Pen, \u201cBolsonaro\u201d (which could cover either Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, or his son Eduardo, who is seeking political asylum in the US), and Beattie himself. It also asked for a search for 32 right-wing buzzwords related to abortion, immigration, election denial, and January 6, suggesting a determined effort to find State Department staff who even just discussed such matters.\u00a0  (Staffers say they doubt that Beattie will find much, unless, one says, it\u2019s \u201cprevious [FOIA] queries from people like Beattie\u201d or discussions about \u201csome Russian or PRC [Chinese] narrative that includes some of this stuff.\u201d)  Multiple sources say State Department employees raised alarms internally about the records requests. They worried about the sensitivity and impropriety of the broad scope of the information requested, particularly because records would be unredacted, as well as about how the search would be conducted: through the eRecords file management system, which makes it easy for administrative staff to search through and retrieve State Department employees\u2019 emails, typically in response to FOIA requests.\u00a0 This felt, they say, like a powerful misuse of the public records system\u2014or as Jankowicz, the disinformation researcher and former DHS official, put it, \u201cweaponizing the access [Beattie] has to internal communications in order to upend people\u2019s lives.\u201d \u201cIt stank to high heaven,\u201d one staffer says. \u201cThis could be used for retaliation. This could be used for any kind of improper purposes, and our oversight committees should be informed of this.\u201d Another employee expressed concerns about the request for information on the agency\u2019s subgrantees\u2014who were often on the ground in repressive countries and whose information was closely guarded and not shared digitally, unlike the public lists of contractors and grantees typically available on websites like Grants.gov or USAspending.gov. \u201cMaking it known that [they] took money from the United States would put a target on them,\u201d this individual explains. \u201cWe kept that information very secure. We wouldn\u2019t even email subgrant names back and forth.\u201d",
    "Several people familiar with the matter say that by early April, Beattie had received many of the documents he\u2019d requested, retrieved through eRecords, as well as a list of grantees. One source says the more sensitive list of subgrantees was not shared.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither the State Department nor Beattie responded to requests for comment. A CISA spokesperson emailed, \u201cWe do not comment on intergovernmental documents and would refer you back to the State Department.\u201d We reached out to all individuals whose communications were requested and are named here; many declined to comment on the record. A \u201cchilling effect\u201d Five weeks after Beattie made his requests for information, the State Department shut down R/FIMI.\u00a0 An hour after staff members were informed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio published a blog post announcing the news on the Federalist, one of the outlets that sued the GEC over allegations of censorship. He then discussed in an interview with the influential right-wing Internet personality Mike Benz plans for Beattie to lead a \u201ctransparency effort.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat we have to do now\u2014and Darren will be big involved in that as well\u2014is sort of document what happened \u2026 because I think people who were harmed deserve to know that, and be able to prove that they were harmed,\u201d Rubio told Benz. This is what Beattie\u2014and Benz\u2014have long called for. Many of the names and keywords he included in his request reflect conspiracy theories and grievances promoted by Revolver News\u2014which Beattie founded after being fired from his job as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration when CNN reported that he had spoken at a conference with white nationalists.\u00a0 Ultimately, the State Department staffers say they fear that a selective disclosure of documents, taken out of context, could be distorted to fit any kind of narrative Beattie, Rubio, or others create.\u00a0 Weaponizing any speech they consider to be critical by deeming it disinformation is not only ironic, says Jankowicz\u2014it will also have \u201cchilling effects\u201d on anyone who conducts disinformation research, and it will result in \u201cless oversight and transparency over tech platforms, over adversarial activities, over, frankly, people who are legitimately trying to disenfranchise US voters.\u201d\u00a0 That, she warns, \u201cis something we should all be alarmed about.\u201d hide"
