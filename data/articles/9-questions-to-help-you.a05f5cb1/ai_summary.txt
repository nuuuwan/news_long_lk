The World Health Organization defines burnout as comprising of sustained feelings of exhaustion, feelings of personal inefficacy, and increased mental distance from one’s job. A Harvard Business Review article presented nine questions to help one diagnose the cause of burnout. The questions cover areas including failure to manage workload, insufficient reward for effort, lack of community, lack of control, insufficient values match, perceived lack of fairness, and conflict between work and personal values. The article notes that burnout is likely to be caused by a combination of factors and should be dealt with over time—it is not something that a brief holiday can alleviate.
