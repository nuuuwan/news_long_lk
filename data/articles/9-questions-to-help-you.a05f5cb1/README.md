# 9 Questions to Help You Figure Out Why Youâ€™re Burned Out

## Summary ðŸ¤–

The World Health Organization defines burnout as comprising of sustained feelings of exhaustion, feelings of personal inefficacy, and increased mental distance from oneâ€™s job. A Harvard Business Review article presented nine questions to help one diagnose the cause of burnout. The questions cover areas including failure to manage workload, insufficient reward for effort, lack of community, lack of control, insufficient values match, perceived lack of fairness, and conflict between work and personal values. The article notes that burnout is likely to be caused by a combination of factors and should be dealt with over timeâ€”it is not something that a brief holiday can alleviate.

The World Health Organization characterizes burnout as comprising three key dimensions: sustained feelings of exhaustion, feelings of personal inefficacy, and increased mental distance from oneâ€™s job. In this article, the author outlines nine questions to ask yourself under each of these three categories to help you diagnose whatâ€™s causing your burnout. Itâ€™s likely a combination of factors, requiring a number of changes over time to fully address it, and not something a one-off vacation can reverse right away. Nonetheless, the answers to these questions serve as a starting point and can inform steps you can take to address your burnout and possibly prevent it from happening again in the future.

Itâ€™s no secret that managers and employees have been suffering from burnout for quite some time.
