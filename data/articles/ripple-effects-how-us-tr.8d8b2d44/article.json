    "Increased tariffs or reduced preferential access to the US market could lead to significant job losses and a decline in export revenue",
    "In an interconnected global economy, the trade policies of major powers like the United States have far-reaching consequences. While geographically distant, Sri Lanka\u2014along with numerous other emerging markets\u2014finds itself vulnerable to the shifting tides of US trade strategies. This article delves into the potential impacts of US trade policies, examining their effects on Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, key export sectors, and the broader implications for regional and global markets.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s trade dependence and vulnerability",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on exports\u2014particularly textiles, apparel, and agricultural products\u2014with the US being a significant market. In 2023, Sri Lanka exported approximately $ 2.5 billion worth of goods to the US, with apparel making up around 70% of these exports. Changes in US trade policies, such as tariffs, quotas, or alterations to trade agreements, can disrupt established supply chains and erode Sri Lanka\u2019s competitive advantage.",

    "Products like tea (accounting for $ 1.2 billion in annual exports), rubber, and spices are crucial commodities. Changes in US import regulations or tariffs could negatively impact these sectors, affecting rural livelihoods and export earnings.",
    "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)",

    "Investor sentiment: Trade uncertainty creates volatility in financial markets, affecting investor confidence and capital flows.",
    "Competitive pressures: Restrictions on other countries may prompt them to enter alternative markets, increasing competition for Sri Lanka.",
    "Comparisons with other emerging markets",
    "Several emerging markets have employed strategies to mitigate the risks posed by US trade policies:",
    "Bangladesh: Despite being a key textile exporter, Bangladesh has leveraged low production costs and market diversification to cushion against US tariffs.",
    "Vietnam: Actively pursued free trade agreements (e.g., CPTPP) to reduce reliance on the US.",
    "India: Negotiated strategic trade deals and strengthened domestic production to reduce vulnerability.",
    "Lesson for Sri Lanka: Prioritise diversification, enhance trade agreements, and build domestic resilience.",
    "Broader market implications",
    "The influence of US trade policies stretches far beyond Sri Lanka, affecting global and regional markets:",
    "Regional trade dynamics: Shifts in policy can reshape trade flows across South and Southeast Asia.",

    "Emerging market vulnerability: Countries with limited diversification and high trade dependency are especially exposed.",
    "Mitigation strategies",

    "1.Diversification of export markets",
    "Reduce reliance on the US by expanding into alternative markets and diversifying products.",

    "5.Engaging in diplomatic efforts",
    "Advocate for predictable and fair trade policies through international diplomacy.",
    "The United States\u2019 trade policies wield considerable influence over global markets, and Sri Lanka is not immune to their effects. While the risks are significant, Sri Lanka can respond strategically\u2014by learning from peer economies, diversifying its trade base, and enhancing domestic resilience.",
    "As global trade continues to evolve, international cooperation and adaptive economic strategies will be essential to ensure long-term economic stability for emerging markets like Sri Lanka.",
