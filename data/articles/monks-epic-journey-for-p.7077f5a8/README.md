In essence, this peace walk is a milestone and an epitome of humanity in American history, thus captivating the spirit of Americans in the name of peace

At a time the world is witnessing a myriad of crises of an unprecedented nature with people often at the receiving end, the winds of blissful peace have begun sweeping across America evoking a feeling of excitement and serenity in the minds of many. Notwithstanding the fact that America is literally engaged in military manoeuvres against a country on its southern border, people of this nation could never in their wildest dreams have imagined the unthinkable, "Walk for Peace Initiative" on their own soil, let alone hundreds and thousands joining it. The war weary veterans too, averse to the futility of war mongering, would have felt the need to support the peace initiative, which is the hour of need.

Peace walk takes Americans by surprise - Defying all odds

Aghast, this winter is no different. To the detriment of Americans, the winter weather has already set in, and mother nature's fury has become the order of the day. It's the norm rather than the exception to expect the worst in the months to follow at the risk of bracing for extremely cold wintery spells of sub-zero temperature. Contrary to expectations, people who do not dare to venture out in the freezing cold, braved calamitous weather and embraced the opportunity of joining the peace walk in thousands, defying all odds. The Walk for Peace Initiative could not have come at a better time, in the face of conflicts raging across Asia, Africa, Middle East, Europe with devastating consequences, which speak loud and clear.  For all compelling reasons, the Walk for Peace Initiative cannot be understated, which, inter-alia has captivated the hearts and minds of Americans across the country for what it's worth. Against all odds, people across America have come together for a worthy cause in a spirit of peace and unity.

The United States and counties across America stand at the intersection of faith, courage and history: this is not a moment Buddhist followers can afford to miss

First of its kind in America - Unparalleled in history

This is no ordinary event, but a meritorious deed of an extraordinary nature - the first of its kind in America. The "Walk for Peace Initiative" is one of a kind.  It is led by a group of 19 Buddhist monks who will be walking from Fort Worth, Texas to Washington DC on a 3200-mile, 110-day spiritual pilgrimage through 10 US states, to promote peace, unity and kindness to mankind throughout the world. It began on 09th October from a monastery in Fort Worth, Texas following an interfaith ceremony where leaders from different faith groups offered their blessings to monks in keeping with Buddhist traditions. In essence, this peace walk is a milestone and an epitome of humanity in American history, thus captivating the spirit of Americans in the name of peace. Obviously, it's a quiet and peaceful call for reflection, compassion and reconciliation.

One mindful step at a time

The peace walk thus far has captivated people from much of this vast country who increasingly excited to join the unexpected. Over the last 66 days, the walk has gained strength and vitality with a massive turnout of well-wishers lining the streets to the delight of the monks. When the peace walk reached the city of Atlanta on the 05th, on its 66th day trekking over 1300 miles, the movement mustered almost 1000 monks and over thousands of well-wishers and followers. What's notable is the fact that the streets from Texas to Atlanta have been overwhelmed by masses of all ages, regardless of nationality, colour, including children and the old. The Walk for Peace Initiative has made headlines in mainstream media, TV channels, social media platforms, with live coverage of proceedings being relayed ever-since its inception, embracing people from all walks of life and social strata. Meanwhile, the monks have amassed a huge fanbase on social media, with more than 400,000 followers on Facebook. They have been documenting their journey on social media, as they continue their journey on foot - "one mindful step at a time".

Reminiscent of the Civil Rights Movement

The peoples' rejoicing of the unity of purpose and coming together to extend their support for the monks could be heard loud and clear, with the passage of time. Their sentiments have been overwhelming and steadfast and are reminiscent of the Civil Rights Movement. The Americans take pride in remembering it as a historic moment in shaping the country's destiny and rich traditions. Drawing parallels, the monks spoke of similarities between the two, with an emphasis on their struggle for justice and social emancipation.

The peace walk, inter-alia, which started on 09th October and continued on Christmas eve, through the dawn of New Year, has already completed half of its journey, including the US States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama along its path towards Washington DC. The walk for peace will wind up in the capital Washington DC on February 2026 covering much of the country's vast terrain. The people who converged on the streets were often heard voicing their support and blessings for the monks who dared to walk an arduous 2300-mile journey for peace. In fact, the monks have become a focal point of what many described as a message that resonated deeply with people across America.

In their journey of peace, the monks took the opportunity to hold what are supposed to be traditional blessings, prayers and sermons on mindfulness which is a hot topic in this day and age

US welcomes monks of faith

The United States and counties across America stand at the intersection of faith, courage and history: this is not a moment Buddhist followers can afford to miss. Indeed, it's a blessing in disguise and a welcome sight to see the monks and their message of faith, togetherness and perseverance as they walk through cities and towns across America spreading the message of peace, love, compassion and healing. Throughout the walk, there has been a groundswell of enthusiasm and interest from well-wishers, who remained lined up to see and greet the monks in thousands. The state representatives welcomed the monks and expressed their kind sentiments and blessings. On some occasions, the state governments issued proclamations welcoming the Walk for Peace Initiative, commending the monks for their courageous initiative at times of chaos and peril. In their sentiments, members of interfaith movements underscored the power of faith and its impact in making the world a better and secure place for all. They expressed optimism that the monks' perseverance and courage would serve as a tacit testimony in pursuit of merits and ultimate happiness.

Essence of the power of mind:  Inner peace, mindfulness and liberation

The "Walk for Peace Initiative" has galvanised a mass movement of Americans all along its way. In their journey of peace, the monks took the opportunity to hold what are supposed to be traditional blessings, prayers and sermons on mindfulness which is a hot topic in this day and age. Those who joined such occasions were genuinely excited to see monks and hear their blessings. Their epic journey is historic and couldn't have come at a better time when people across the world are in pursuit of five self-centred aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness), forming the basis of the sense of self, which they mistakenly cling to, as aptly emphasised in the Buddhist doctrine of "self". That being said, the human mind, psyche and self, often are at the centre of an intense debate and discussion forming two different schools of thought from spiritual and physiological standpoints. According to Vasala Sutra (Discourse on Outcastes), which is a key scripture within the Buddhist Canon, the Buddha said, "No person shall become a saint or devil by birth or family lineage, and, that it is one's own acts and karma (thoughts and deeds) that make one, a saint or demon". In essence, conquering one's own mind is the key to achieving inner peace, sanity and freedom from the tyranny of uncontrolled desires, leading to a more fulfilling and purposeful existence which is what peace is all about.

The Buddhist monks who envisioned their "Walk for Peace Initiative" have become a focal point of what many described as a message that resonates deeply with the people of America, devoid of religious, cultural, language differences.  The group of monks, representing major Buddhist countries, have inspired many followers to dive deep into the tenets of Buddhist philosophy and spirituality for self-reflection and liberation. On their part, the Americans tend to rely heavily on meditation and mindfulness to foster mental and physical wellbeing to help them thrive amidst their busy schedules at home and workplaces. As such, they often practice mindfulness as a way of life and emancipation. America's quest for supporting the "Walk for Peace Initiative" underscores their trust and faith in Buddhist philosophy and its path for inner peace and liberation, worthy of humanity.

Sadly, the "Walk for Peace" is not at all without setbacks. Already, three monks have suffered injuries due to an accident.  But their sheer perseverance and courage for peace have kept them going despite sustaining serious injuries and one of them losing a leg after it was amputated. All monks ought to be admired for their spirit of bravery and resoluteness.

Conquering one's own mind is the key to achieving inner peace, sanity and freedom from the tyranny of uncontrolled desires, leading to a more fulfilling and purposeful existence which is what peace is all about

Spiritual leader's message

The spiritual leader of the ‘‘Walk for Peace Initiative’’, Ven Bhikkhu Pannakara of Vietnamese origin has said "peace is not a destination, it's a way of life. And that peace resides within each of us. The walk is a reminder that unity and kindness begin within each of us and can radiate outward to communities, families and society as a whole. Even though we have different beliefs, we all have one religion and one faith in common, which is - Religion of Peace, Compassion and Loving Kindness.  This is what all beings are seeking".

Unparalleled service of Sri Lankan Buddhist monks

Our Buddhist monks have been a tremendous source of support and inspiration for the peace walk. Among others, the most Ven Henepola Gunaratana Thero, Chief Incumbent of the West Virginia Monastery has rendered a yeoman service for the renaissance of Buddhist philosophy and practices in America for over 60 years through his scholarly work, preachings and sermons. Moreover, erudite monks of the likes of Ven Katugastota Uparatana and Ven Maharagama Dhammasiri, to name a few, too have immensely contributed to the propagation of Buddhism and the spiritual way of life for people in Washington DC, Maryland and elsewhere. Monks based in Washington DC, Virginia and Maryland are planning to join the peace walk in Washington DC in February at the end of its 2300-mile journey.

The Walk could not have come at a better time when the world is mired in a plethora of crises and conflicts, leading to widespread chaos, divisions etc

Key takeaways and prospects

As a matter of fact, "Walk for Peace" – is a novel initiative conceptualised and grounded in the tenets of the Buddhist doctrine of peace, non-violence and loving kindness. It could not have come at a better time when the world is mired in a plethora of crises and conflicts, leading to widespread chaos, divisions etc. In the circumstances, the monks' clarion call for peace and fundamental changes is timely and worthy of humanity for all intents and purposes.

That said, how well their appeal would resonate with the people of faith, and, to what extent it would translate into action, and, how far it would integrate with and be acceptable to masses across America and the world at large remain to be seen in the weeks and months to follow.

Judging by the status quo on the ground, one could not help but breathe a sigh of relief and be upbeat about the impact of the "Walk for Peace Initiative" for the future wellbeing of mankind. In the short term, the monks are out on the streets with a message of peace and  love for people of faith across America. In the medium term and long term, their goal is to spread peace, unity, solidarity and loving kindness among people across America and the world, with the aim of fulfilling peoples' expectations to be aware of what lies ahead, and guide them on the path towards self-reflection, self-realisation and mindfulness, which resonates well and truly with spirits of humanity, an epitome of selflessness, humaneness and righteousness of the mankind.
