As the closing date for filing income tax returns draws closer (on or before 30 November), taxpayers, auditors, and consultants are working against the clock to finalise their computations. Recognising the importance of this process at a national level, the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) took the lead in organising a free, trilingual webinar designed to educate and support taxpayers in filing their returns online.

The initiative was conducted by the Committee for Research, Knowledge Mobilisation, and Taxation (RKMT) of ICCSL. The session brought together experts and practitioners to guide participants on key aspects of online filing, from technical procedures to clarifying complex rules.

Trilingual effort to educate taxpayers

ICCSL Chairman Shanil Fernando, highlighted the Chamber’s commitment to strengthening taxpayer awareness and compliance through accessible platforms. Resource persons for the webinar included: Inland Revenue Department Senior Deputy Commissioner Hiran Meneripitiya (Sinhala presenter), Tax, Ernst & Young Principal Velauthapillai Shakthivel (Tamil presenter), and KPMG Principal – Tax & Regulatory Rifka Ziyard (English presenter). Their presentations addressed a diverse audience, reflecting Sri Lanka’s multilingual taxpayer community. They as the panel also fielded questions, offering clarifications on both technical processes and broader compliance issues. The session was moderated by RKMT of ICCSL Chairperson Dr. Nadee Dissanayake, who ensured smooth coordination across the three languages. For those unable to attend live, the webinar remains available on the ICCSL Facebook page.

High engagement webinar

The event attracted strong participation, with many taxpayers actively raising questions throughout the session. This overwhelming response revealed two important insights: the strong demand for taxpayer guidance, and the extent of the knowledge gaps that remain in areas such as technical filing, tax calculations, and documentation.

In response, the RKMT Committee announced plans to produce a follow-up video answering the most important questions. This was also made available on ICCSL’s Facebook platform, ensuring that taxpayers continue to receive timely and practical support.

The panellists diligently addressed all questions, offering detailed insights on how to address the issues raised.

Revealing critical gap

The session underscored a broader challenge facing Sri Lanka’s tax system: while online filing platforms provide efficiency and transparency, many taxpayers still struggle with the technical details. Areas of difficulty include:

Selecting the correct schedules.

Understanding supporting documentation requirements.

Clarifying calculations under specific rules.

Interpreting certain technical concepts and compliance obligations.

The active engagement of participants confirmed that such gaps are not isolated, but systemic, requiring sustained attention from responsible authorities.

Call for clearer guidance

The RKMT initiative of ICCSL highlights how non-state sector bodies can effectively complement Government efforts by providing accessible platforms for taxpayer education. However, the volume of questions raised shows the need for clearer, more structured guidance directly from regulatory authorities. Tax compliance goes beyond a technical exercise, it is vital for national revenue and development. For success, taxpayers require simple instructions, reliable support channels, and transparent communication. Bridging this gap calls for stronger collaboration: authorities must adopt responsive tools, while organisations like ICCSL expand awareness and dialogue. Together, they can transform filing into a manageable and responsible civic duty.

The ICCSL webinar showed how public-private collaboration can support taxpayers through expert, multilingual, and accessible guidance. With deadlines nearing, clarity and timely help are critical. Strong participation revealed both challenges and opportunities to improve awareness. Building an inclusive, efficient tax culture requires consistent, user-friendly communication an effort that must be led by tax authorities alongside partners. Media coverage supported by Daily FT.
