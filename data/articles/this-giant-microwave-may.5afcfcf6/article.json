    "Imagine: China deploys hundreds of thousands of autonomous drones in the air, on the sea, and under the water\u2014all armed with explosive warheads or small missiles. These machines descend in a swarm toward military installations on Taiwan and nearby US\u00a0bases, and over the course of a few hours, a single robotic blitzkrieg overwhelms the US Pacific force before it can even begin to fight back.\u00a0 Maybe it sounds like a new Michael Bay movie, but it\u2019s the scenario that keeps the chief technology officer of the US Army up at night.  \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to say it out loud so I don\u2019t manifest it,\u201d says Alex Miller, a longtime Army intelligence official who became the CTO to the Army\u2019s chief of staff in 2023. Even if World War III doesn\u2019t break out in the South China Sea, every US military installation around the world is vulnerable to the same tactics\u2014as are the militaries of every other country around the world. The proliferation of cheap drones means just about any group with the wherewithal to assemble and launch a swarm could wreak havoc, no expensive jets or massive missile installations required.",

His work may determine the future of Ukraine, and wars far beyond it.",
    "While the US has precision missiles that can shoot these drones down, they don\u2019t always succeed: A drone attack killed three US soldiers and injured dozens more at a base in the Jordanian desert last year. And each American missile costs orders of magnitude more than its targets, which limits their supply; countering thousand-dollar drones with missiles that cost hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars per shot can only work for so long, even with a defense budget that could reach a trillion dollars next year. The US armed forces are now hunting for a solution\u2014and they want it fast. Every branch of the service and a host of defense tech startups are testing out new weapons that promise to disable drones en masse. There are drones that slam into other drones like battering rams; drones that shoot out nets to ensnare quadcopter propellers; precision-guided Gatling guns that simply shoot drones out of the sky; electronic approaches, like GPS jammers and direct hacking tools; and lasers that melt holes clear through a target\u2019s side.",
    "Then there are the microwaves: high-powered electronic devices that push out kilowatts of power to zap the circuits of a drone as if it were the tinfoil you forgot to take off your leftovers when you heated them up.\u00a0 That\u2019s where Epirus comes in.\u00a0  When I went to visit the HQ of this 185-person startup in Torrance, California, earlier this year, I got a behind-the-scenes look at its massive microwave, called Leonidas, which the US Army is already betting on as a cutting-edge anti-drone weapon. The Army awarded Epirus a $66 million contract in early 2023, topped that up with another $17 million last fall, and is currently deploying a handful of the systems for testing with US troops in the Middle East and the Pacific. (The Army won\u2019t get into specifics on the location of the weapons in the Middle East but published a report of a live-fire test in the Philippines in early May.)\u00a0 Up close, the Leonidas that Epirus built for the Army looks like a two-foot-thick slab of metal the size of a garage door stuck on a swivel mount. Pop the back cover, and you can see that the slab is filled with dozens of individual microwave amplifier units in a grid. Each is about the size of a safe-deposit box and built around a chip made of gallium nitride, a semiconductor that can survive much higher voltages and temperatures than the typical silicon.\u00a0 Leonidas sits on top of a trailer that a standard-issue Army truck can tow, and when it is powered on, the company\u2019s software tells the grid of amps and antennas to shape the electromagnetic waves they\u2019re blasting out with a phased array, precisely overlapping the microwave signals to mold the energy into a focused beam. Instead of needing to physically point a gun or parabolic dish at each of a thousand incoming drones, the Leonidas can flick between them at the speed of software.  The Leonidas contains dozens of microwave amplifier units and can pivot to direct waves at incoming swarms of drones.EPIRUS   Of course, this isn\u2019t magic\u2014there are practical limits on how much damage one array can do, and at what range\u2014but the total effect could be described as an electromagnetic pulse emitter, a death ray for electronics, or a force field that could set up a protective barrier around military installations and drop drones the way a bug zapper fizzles a mob of mosquitoes.  I walked through the nonclassified sections of the Leonidas factory floor, where a cluster of engineers working on weaponeering\u2014the military term for figuring out exactly how much of a weapon, be it high explosive or microwave beam, is necessary to achieve a desired effect\u2014ran tests in a warren of smaller anechoic rooms. Inside, they shot individual microwave units at a broad range of commercial and military drones, cycling through waveforms and power levels to try to find the signal that could fry each one with maximum efficiency.\u00a0 On a live video feed from inside one of these foam-padded rooms, I watched a quadcopter drone spin its propellers and then, once the microwave emitter turned on, instantly stop short\u2014first the propeller on the front left and then the rest. A drone hit with a Leonidas beam doesn\u2019t explode\u2014it just falls. Compared with the blast of a missile or the sizzle of a laser, it doesn\u2019t look like much. But it could force enemies to come up with costlier ways of attacking that reduce the advantage of the drone swarm, and it could get around the inherent limitations of purely electronic or strictly physical defense systems. It could save lives. Epirus CEO Andy Lowery, a tall guy with sparkplug energy and a rapid-fire southern Illinois twang, doesn\u2019t shy away from talking big about his product. As he told me during my visit, Leonidas is intended to lead a last stand, like the Spartan from whom the microwave takes its name\u2014in this case, against hordes of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. While the actual range of the Leonidas system is kept secret, Lowery says the Army is looking for a solution that can reliably stop drones within a few kilometers. He told me, \u201cThey would like our system to be the owner of that final layer\u2014to get any squeakers, any leakers, anything like that.\u201d",
    "Now that they\u2019ve told the world they \u201cinvented a force field,\u201d Lowery added, the focus is on manufacturing at scale\u2014before the drone swarms really start to descend or a nation with a major military decides to launch a new war. Before, in other words, Miller\u2019s nightmare scenario becomes reality.\u00a0 Why zap? Miller remembers well when the danger of small weaponized drones first appeared on his radar. Reports of Islamic State fighters strapping grenades to the bottom of commercial DJI Phantom quadcopters first emerged in late 2016 during the Battle of Mosul. \u201cI went, \u2018Oh, this is going to be bad,\u2019 because basically it\u2019s an airborne IED at that point,\u201d he says. He\u2019s tracked the danger as it\u2019s built steadily since then, with advances in machine vision, AI coordination software, and suicide drone tactics only accelerating.\u00a0 Then the war in Ukraine showed the world that cheap technology has fundamentally changed how warfare happens. We have watched in high-definition video how a cheap, off-the-shelf drone modified to carry a small bomb can be piloted directly into a faraway truck, tank, or group of troops to devastating effect. And larger suicide drones, also known as \u201cloitering munitions,\u201d can be produced for just tens of thousands of dollars and launched in massive salvos to hit soft targets or overwhelm more advanced military defenses through sheer numbers.\u00a0  As a result, Miller, along with large swaths of the Pentagon and DC policy circles, believes that the current US arsenal for defending against these weapons is just too expensive and the tools in too short supply to truly match the threat. Related StoryWe saw a demo of the new AI system powering Anduril\u2019s vision for warWe\u2019re living through the first drone wars, but AI is poised to change the future of warfare even more drastically.",
    "Just look at Yemen, a poor country where the Houthi military group has been under constant attack for the past decade. Armed with this new low-tech arsenal, in the past 18 months the rebel group has been able to bomb cargo ships and effectively disrupt global shipping in the Red Sea\u2014part of an effort to apply pressure on Israel to stop its war in Gaza. The Houthis have also used missiles, suicide drones, and even drone boats to launch powerful attacks on US Navy ships sent to stop them. The most successful defense tech firm selling anti-drone weapons to the US military right now is Anduril, the company started by Palmer Luckey, the inventor of the Oculus VR headset, and a crew of cofounders from Oculus and defense data giant Palantir. In just the past few months, the Marines have chosen Anduril for counter-drone contracts that could be worth nearly $850 million over the next decade, and the company has been working with Special Operations Command since 2022 on a counter-drone contract that could be worth nearly a billion dollars over a similar time frame. It\u2019s unclear from the contracts what, exactly, Anduril is selling to each organization, but its weapons include electronic warfare jammers, jet-powered drone bombs, and propeller-driven Anvil drones designed to simply smash into enemy drones. In this arsenal, the cheapest way to stop a swarm of drones is electronic warfare: jamming the GPS or radio signals used to pilot the machines. But the intense drone battles in Ukraine have advanced the art of jamming and counter-jamming close to the point of stalemate. As a result, a new state of the art is emerging: unjammable drones that operate autonomously by using onboard processors to navigate via internal maps and computer vision, or even drones connected with 20-kilometer-long filaments of fiber-optic cable for tethered control.",
    "But unjammable doesn\u2019t mean unzappable. Instead of using the scrambling method of a jammer, which employs an antenna to block the drone\u2019s connection to a pilot or remote guidance system, the Leonidas microwave beam hits a drone body broadside. The energy finds its way into something electrical, whether the central flight controller or a tiny wire controlling a flap on a wing, to short-circuit whatever\u2019s available. (The company also says that this targeted hit of energy allows birds and other wildlife to continue to move safely.) Tyler Miller, a senior systems engineer on Epirus\u2019s weaponeering team, told me that they never know exactly which part of the target drone is going to go down first, but they\u2019ve reliably seen the microwave signal get in somewhere to overload a circuit. \u201cBased on the geometry and the way the wires are laid out,\u201d he said, one of those wires is going to be the best path in. \u201cSometimes if we rotate the drone 90 degrees, you have a different motor go down first,\u201d he added.",
    "The team has even tried wrapping target drones in copper tape, which would theoretically provide shielding, only to find that the microwave still finds a way in through moving propeller shafts or antennas that need to remain exposed for the drone to fly.\u00a0 EPIRUS  Leonidas also has an edge when it comes to downing a mass of drones at once. Physically hitting a drone out of the sky or lighting it up with a laser can be effective in situations where electronic warfare fails, but anti-drone drones can only take out one at a time, and lasers need to precisely aim and shoot. Epirus\u2019s microwaves can damage everything in a roughly 60-degree arc from the Leonidas emitter simultaneously and keep on zapping and zapping; directed energy systems like this one never run out of ammo.  As for cost, each Army Leonidas unit currently runs in the \u201clow eight figures,\u201d Lowery told me. Defense contract pricing can be opaque, but Epirus delivered four units for its $66 million initial contract, giving a back-of-napkin price around $16.5 million each. For comparison, Stinger missiles from Raytheon, which soldiers shoot at enemy aircraft or drones from a shoulder-mounted launcher, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop, meaning the Leonidas could start costing less (and keep shooting) after it downs the first wave of a swarm. Raytheon\u2019s radar, reversed Epirus is part of a new wave of venture-capital-backed defense companies trying to change the way weapons are created\u2014and the way the Pentagon buys them. The largest defense companies, firms like Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin, typically develop new weapons in response to research grants and cost-plus contracts, in which the US Department of Defense guarantees a certain profit margin to firms building products that match their laundry list of technical specifications. These programs have kept the military supplied with cutting-edge weapons for decades, but the results may be exquisite pieces of military machinery delivered years late and billions of dollars over budget. Rather than building to minutely detailed specs, the new crop of military contractors aim to produce products on a quick time frame to solve a problem and then fine-tune them as they pitch to the military. The model, pioneered by Palantir and SpaceX, has since propelled companies like Anduril, Shield AI, and dozens of other smaller startups into the business of war as venture capital piles tens of billions of dollars into defense. Like Anduril, Epirus has direct Palantir roots; it was cofounded by Joe Lonsdale, who also cofounded Palantir, and John Tenet, Lonsdale\u2019s colleague at the time at his venture fund, 8VC. (Tenet, the son of former CIA director George Tenet, may have inspired the company\u2019s name\u2014the elder Tenet\u2019s parents were born in the Epirus region in the northwest of Greece. But the company more often says it\u2019s a reference to the pseudo-mythological Epirus Bow from the 2011 fantasy action movie Immortals, which never runs out of arrows.)",
    "While Epirus is doing business in the new mode, its roots are in the old\u2014specifically in Raytheon, a pioneer in the field of microwave technology. Cofounded by MIT professor Vannevar Bush in 1922, it manufactured vacuum tubes, like those found in old radios. But the company became synonymous with electronic defense during World War II, when Bush spun up a lab to develop early microwave radar technology invented by the British into a workable product, and Raytheon then began mass-producing microwave tubes\u2014known as magnetrons\u2014for the US war effort. By the end of the war in 1945, Raytheon was making 80% of the magnetrons powering Allied radar across the world.  From padded foam chambers at the Epirus HQ, Leonidas devices can be safely tested on drones.EPIRUS   Large tubes remained the best way to emit high-power microwaves for more than half a century, handily outperforming silicon-based solid-state amplifiers. They\u2019re still around\u2014the microwave on your kitchen counter runs on a vacuum tube magnetron. But tubes have downsides: They\u2019re hot, they\u2019re big, and they require upkeep. (In fact, the other microwave drone zapper currently in the Pentagon pipeline, the Tactical High-power Operational Responder, or THOR, still relies on a physical vacuum tube. It\u2019s reported to be effective at downing drones in tests but takes up a whole shipping container and needs a dish antenna to zap its targets.) By the 2000s, new methods of building solid-state amplifiers out of materials like gallium nitride started to mature and were able to handle more power than silicon without melting or shorting out. The US Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars on cutting-edge microwave contracts, one for a project at Raytheon called Next Generation Jammer\u2014geared specifically toward designing a new way to make high-powered microwaves that work at extremely long distances. Lowery, the Epirus CEO, began his career working on nuclear reactors on Navy aircraft carriers before he became the chief engineer for Next Generation Jammer at Raytheon in 2010. There, he and his team worked on a system that relied on many of the same fundamentals that now power the Leonidas\u2014using the same type of amplifier material and antenna setup to fry the electronics of a small target at much closer range rather than disrupting the radar of a target hundreds of miles away.",
    "The similarity is not a coincidence: Two engineers from Next Generation Jammer helped launch Epirus in 2018. Lowery\u2014who by then was working at the augmented-reality startup RealWear, which makes industrial smart glasses\u2014joined Epirus in 2021 to run product development and was asked to take the top spot as CEO in 2023, as Leonidas became a fully formed machine. Much of the founding team has since departed for other projects, but Raytheon still runs through the company\u2019s collective CV: ex-Raytheon radar engineer Matt Markel started in January as the new CTO, and Epirus\u2019s chief engineer for defense, its VP of engineering, its VP of operations, and a number of employees all have Raytheon roots as well. Markel tells me that the Epirus way of working wouldn\u2019t have flown at one of the big defense contractors: \u201cThey never would have tried spinning off the technology into a new application without a contract lined up.\u201d The Epirus engineers saw the use case, raised money to start building Leonidas, and already had prototypes in the works before any military branch started awarding money to work on the project. Waiting for the starting gun On the wall of Lowery\u2019s office are two mementos from testing days at an Army proving ground: a trophy wing from a larger drone, signed by the whole testing team, and a framed photo documenting the Leonidas\u2019s carnage\u2014a stack of dozens of inoperative drones piled up in a heap.\u00a0 Despite what seems to have been an impressive test show, it\u2019s still impossible from the outside to determine whether Epirus\u2019s tech is ready to fully deliver if the swarms descend.\u00a0 The Army would not comment specifically on the efficacy of any new weapons in testing or early deployment, including the Leonidas system. A spokesperson for the Army\u2019s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, or RCCTO, which is the subsection responsible for contracting with Epirus to date, would only say in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to developing and fielding innovative Directed Energy solutions to address evolving threats.\u201d\u00a0 But various high-ranking officers appear to be giving Epirus a public vote of confidence. The three-star general who runs RCCTO and oversaw the Leonidas testing last summer told Breaking Defense that \u201cthe system actually worked very well,\u201d even if there was work to be done on \u201chow the weapon system fits into the larger kill chain.\u201d And when former secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth, then the service\u2019s highest-ranking civilian, gave a parting interview this past January, she mentioned Epirus in all but name, citing \u201cone company\u201d that is \u201cusing high-powered microwaves to basically be able to kill swarms of drones.\u201d She called that kind of capability \u201ccritical for the Army.\u201d\u00a0 The Army isn\u2019t the only branch interested in the microwave weapon. On Epirus\u2019s factory floor when I visited, alongside the big beige Leonidases commissioned by the Army, engineers were building a smaller expeditionary version for the Marines, painted green, which it delivered in late April. Videos show that when it put some of its microwave emitters on a dock and tested them out for the Navy last summer, the microwaves left their targets dead in the water\u2014successfully frying the circuits of outboard motors like the ones propelling Houthi drone boats.\u00a0  Epirus is also currently working on an even smaller version of the Leonidas that can mount on top of the Army\u2019s Stryker combat vehicles, and it\u2019s testing out attaching a single microwave unit to a small airborne drone, which could work as a highly focused zapper to disable cars, data centers, or single enemy drones.\u00a0  Epirus\u2019s microwave technology is also being tested in devices smaller than the traditional Leonidas. EPIRUS   While neither the Army nor the Navy has yet to announce a contract to start buying Epirus\u2019s systems at scale, the company and its investors are actively preparing for the big orders to start rolling in. It raised $250 million in a funding round in early March to get ready to make as many Leonidases as possible in the coming years, adding to the more than $300 million it\u2019s raised since opening its doors in 2018. \u201cIf you invent a force field that works,\u201d Lowery boasts, \u201cyou really get a lot of attention.\u201d The task for Epirus now, assuming that its main customers pull the trigger and start buying more Leonidases, is ramping up production while advancing the tech in its systems. Then there are the more prosaic problems of staffing, assembly, and testing at scale. For future generations, Lowery told me, the goal is refining the antenna design and integrating higher-powered microwave amplifiers to push the output into the tens of kilowatts, allowing for increased range and efficacy.\u00a0 While this could be made harder by Trump\u2019s global trade war, Lowery says he\u2019s not worried about their supply chain; while China produces 98% of the world\u2019s gallium, according to the US Geological Survey, and has choked off exports to the US, Epirus\u2019s chip supplier uses recycled gallium from Japan.\u00a0 The other outside challenge may be that Epirus isn\u2019t the only company building a drone zapper. One of China\u2019s state-owned defense companies has been working on its own anti-drone high-powered microwave weapon called the Hurricane, which it displayed at a major military show in late 2024.\u00a0 It may be a sign that anti-electronics force fields will become common among the world\u2019s militaries\u2014and if so, the future of war is unlikely to go back to the status quo ante, and it might zag in a different direction yet again. But military planners believe it\u2019s crucial for the US not to be left behind. So if it works as promised, Epirus could very well change the way that war will play out in the coming decade.\u00a0 While Miller, the Army CTO, can\u2019t speak directly to Epirus or any specific system, he will say that he believes anti-drone measures are going to have to become ubiquitous for US soldiers. \u201cCounter-UAS [Unmanned Aircraft System] unfortunately is going to be like counter-IED,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be every soldier\u2019s job to think about UAS threats the same way it was to think about IEDs.\u201d\u00a0 And, he adds, it\u2019s his job and his colleagues\u2019 to make sure that tech so effective it works like \u201calmost magic\u201d is in the hands of the average rifleman. To that end, Lowery told me, Epirus is designing the Leonidas control system to work simply for troops, allowing them to identify a cluster of targets and start zapping with just a click of a button\u2014but only extensive use in the field can prove that out.  Epirus CEO Andy Lowery sees the Leonidas as providing a last line of defense against UAVs.EPIRUS   In the not-too-distant future, Lowery says, this could mean setting up along the US-Mexico border. But the grandest vision for Epirus\u2019s tech that he says he\u2019s heard is for a city-scale Leonidas along the lines of a ballistic missile defense radar system called PAVE PAWS, which takes up an entire 105-foot-tall building and can detect distant nuclear missile launches. The US set up four in the 1980s, and Taiwan currently has one up on a mountain south of Taipei. Fill a similar-size building full of microwave emitters, and the beam could reach out \u201c10 or 15 miles,\u201d Lowery told me, with one sitting sentinel over Taipei in the north and another over Kaohsiung in the south of Taiwan. Riffing in Greek mythological mode, Lowery said of drones, \u201cI call all these mischief makers. Whether they\u2019re doing drugs or guns across the border or they\u2019re flying over Langley [or] they\u2019re spying on F-35s, they\u2019re all like Icarus. You remember Icarus, with his wax wings? Flying all around\u2014\u2018Nobody\u2019s going to touch me, nobody\u2019s going to ever hurt me.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe built one hell of a wax-wing melter.\u201d\u00a0 Sam Dean is a reporter focusing on business, tech, and defense.
