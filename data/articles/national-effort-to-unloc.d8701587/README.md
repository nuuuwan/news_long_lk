Sri Lanka’s natural heritage continues to reflect the importance of responsible environmental stewardship, and one such treasure, the Ambuluwawa Biodiversity Complex, is now the focus of a significant national initiative. Recognising both the ecological and recreational value of this remarkable site, the Institute of Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka (IEPSL) is launching a comprehensive biodiversity and recreational value assessment, in collaboration with the Ambuluwawa Religious Centre and Biodiversity Complex Trust Fund, and with generous support from Ansell Lanka Ltd. as the official sponsor.

This important study, set to commence on 20 June 2025, aims to evaluate Ambuluwawa’s biodiversity richness and tourism impact, while promoting sustainable visitation. A team of environmental scientists and conservation professionals from IEPSL along with invited subject matter experts will conduct an initial field exploration and stakeholder visit on the same day, marking the formal start of the project.

A sanctuary of biodiversity and cultural harmony

Situated in the central highlands near Gampola, Ambuluwawa lies at the intersection of intermediate, and wet climatic zones, forming a rare ecological mosaic that supports diverse plant and animal life. While its spiral tower and panoramic views attract thousands of local and international tourists, the deeper ecological significance of the site remains relatively underexplored. The upcoming research seeks to fill this gap through systematic assessments of flora, fauna, habitat types, and visitor pressure, using both scientific methods and stakeholder insights. The biodiversity assessment report is expected to be published within three months, offering actionable knowledge for site managers, policymakers, and conservationists.

Importantly, the project reflects a balanced approach that appreciates Ambuluwawa’s religious, cultural, and ecological value. The involvement of the Ambuluwawa Trust Fund ensures alignment with local perspectives, while IEPSL’s scientific leadership ensures that findings will contribute to Sri Lanka’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP).

Sustainable tourism and national impact

Ambuluwawa’s growing popularity also presents environmental challenges. Unregulated tourism can lead to trail erosion, littering, habitat disturbance, and pressure on sensitive species. The research team will evaluate these impacts through field studies, visitor interviews, and ecological observations, with the goal of developing practical, science-based solutions that enhance visitor experience without harming the environment. Recommendations may include improved waste management systems, environmentally sensitive trail designs, interpretive signage, and public education efforts, making Ambuluwawa a national model for eco-conscious tourism. The initiative also supports capacity building, as university students and early-career researchers will participate in the project, gaining experience in biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.

Beyond Ambuluwawa, the research is expected to act as a catalyst for identifying other hidden biodiversity hotspots across Sri Lanka. Many such sites remain unassessed, and this model of integrated ecological and recreational evaluation could be replicated elsewhere to protect and promote Sri Lanka’s unique natural heritage. This effort also highlights the value of public-private collaboration in environmental protection. The partnership between IEPSL, local institutions, and Ansell Lanka Ltd. reflects how corporate environmental responsibility can support national sustainability goals. Moreover, the inclusion of the religious centre ensures that conservation work proceeds with cultural sensitivity and community engagement.

IEPSL invites Government bodies, tourism operators, researchers, and the wider public to support this timely initiative. By working together, Sri Lanka can ensure that places like Ambuluwawa are not only preserved but celebrated as living classrooms where biodiversity, culture, and sustainability converge.
