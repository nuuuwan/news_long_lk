Increasingly, AI systems are interconnected, which is generating new complexities and risks. Managing these ecosystems effectively requires comprehensive training, designing technological infrastructures and processes so they foster collaboration, and robust governance frameworks. Examples from healthcare, financial services, and legal profession illustrate the challenges and ways to overcome them.

A doctor uses AI to draft a prior authorization request, transforming what might be a tedious, time-consuming process into an efficient one. Yet, if an insurer’s AI rejects the request based on criteria the doctor’s system didn’t account for, the result is delays and frustration. This is the new reality of AI ecosystems: interconnected networks of intelligent agents and systems that collaborate, compete, or clash across business units or organizations. These ecosystems can offer new opportunities but also introduce new complexities and risks.
