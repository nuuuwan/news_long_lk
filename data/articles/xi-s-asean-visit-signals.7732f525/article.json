    "What\u2019s happened?On April 14th-18th China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, visited three ASEAN countries\u2014Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia\u2014and met their respective leaders, while his delegations held meetings with their counterparts. Numerous memoranda of understanding and joint statements were signed.Why does it matter?Mr Xi\u2019s visit largely illustrates China\u2019s long-term strategy towards the region and is not a reaction to the recent US policy, although some commitment offers to the ASEAN countries may have been crafted with Mr Trump\u2019s protectionist policies in mind. China\u2019s once-in-a-decade conference on neighbour diplomacy has reaffirmed its strategy to deepen ties with the global south, particularly South-east Asian countries that are geographically close to China and diplomatically friendly compared to their South Asian neighbours.During Mr Xi\u2019s visit, China offered expanded market access for agricultural goods, technology exchanges and infrastructure developments for those ASEAN countries. Although infrastructure development has always been a common feature in China\u2019s bilateral relations with these countries, the expanded co-operation in technology and better access to China\u2019s domestic market\u2014as well as closer defence overture\u2014are relatively new. The choice of the countries also demonstrates China\u2019s recognition of the important roles that Vietnam and Malaysia play in China\u2019s global supply-chain footprint and China\u2019s desire to deepen such engagements. Meanwhile, Cambodia has always been China\u2019s closest ally in South-east Asia.The visit signals that\u00a0ASEAN engagement with China will not materially reduce in the light of US trade tensions.\u00a0A warm reception was accorded to Mr\u00a0Xi and his delegation by the host countries and there were extensive new agreements signed between them. The continuing amicable relationship between these ASEAN countries and China is testament to the strong economic clout that China has on their countries amid other considerations; Vietnam and Malaysia have outstanding conflicting maritime claims in the South China\u00a0Sea against China.Mr Xi\u2019s tactic was to contrast China\u2019s style with the US\u2019s coercive approach. China is not asking its neighbours to choose a side (at least not overtly).\u00a0Closer co-operation frameworks are in the works after the visit: the \u201c3+3\u201d\u00a0strategic dialogue mechanism on diplomacy, defence and public security between Vietnam and China; the \u201c2+2\u201d\u00a0dialogue mechanism on diplomacy and defence with Malaysia; and the \u201c2+2\u201d\u00a0dialogue mechanism with Cambodia.\u00a0Vietnam and Malaysia are likely to see less aggression from China on the issue of the\u00a0South China Sea,\u00a0as China is keen to preserve good relations to preserve its sphere of influence. In particular, we note that the joint statement with Vietnam stated that the two countries agree to \u201cuphold the role of the joint patrol mechanism in the Gulf of Tonkin\u2026[and] deepen the exchange and co-operation mechanism between the navies and coast guards of the two countries.\u201d In the joint statement with Malaysia, both sides \u201cemphasised the importance of maintaining peace, security and stability in the South\u00a0China\u00a0Sea\u2026[and] agreed to resolve disputes by peaceful means\u201d, as well as \u201clook forward to the conclusion of an effective and substantive Code\u00a0of Conduct in the South China\u00a0Sea in 2026\u201d. This may not guarantee a lasting resolution on maritime territorial disputes, but we consider it a prelude to a lull in recent confrontations.What next?While there are plenty of positive signs that Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia will continue to tighten their constructive engagements with China,\u00a0there will be challenges that cause\u00a0minor trade conflicts between China and ASEAN. Under the de\u00a0facto trade embargo with the\u00a0US, cheap Chinese goods will make their way to South-east\u00a0Asia and cause grievance to local producers, which will require limited and temporary trade barriers (such as the anti-dumping duty that Vietnam imposed on Chinese steel). Vietnam and Malaysia will also, to a certain extent, be stricter about China\u2019s export transshipment via their countries in order to preserve good relations with the\u00a0US. Nevertheless, we believe that\u00a0any trade measures introduced against China by Vietnam and Malaysia in the future will be measured and\u00a0moderate.ASEAN\u2019s strong ties with China will not go unnoticed by the US and are likely to affect those countries\u2019 negotiations with the US.\u00a0Whether or not the US will keep the bulk of the threatened reciprocal tariffs intact after the 90-day\u00a0pause, it will continue to\u00a0curtail China\u2019s activities\u00a0through punitive trade measures more so than against other countries, which will still affect the \u201cconnector\u201d countries for China. The\u00a0US\u2019s plan to impose sky-high tariffs (reported at more than\u00a03,000% for some manufacturers in Cambodia) on solar cells and panels imported from South-east\u00a0Asia is another extreme case in point that will cause great harm to the ASEAN solar manufacturers with close China ties. China\u2019s transshipment issues via ASEAN have existed since the first Trump administration, and the second Trump\u00a0administration is now more determined to clamp down on it. Given existing close supply-chain ties with China, ASEAN as a bloc will face harsher US trade restrictions relative to other regions such as Africa or Latin\u00a0America.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
