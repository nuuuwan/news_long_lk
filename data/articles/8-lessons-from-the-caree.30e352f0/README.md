Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder and CEO of SoftBank, the Japanese media technology conglomerate, is often cast as a dreamer, financial engineer, and speculator. But his career — which has spanned the launch of the personal computer and internet, dotcom boom and bust, the rise of China, the global financial crisis, and the advent of artificial intelligence — offers eight key lessons for leaders. They include:  turn adversity to advantage, find a way to persist, bridge east and west, seek mentors and mentees, go big or go home, don’t let love outweigh logic, beware mercenaries, and focus on the future.

Few characters are more enigmatic or misunderstood than Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder and CEO of SoftBank, the Japanese media technology conglomerate.
