Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, a Sri Lankan intellectual and political commentator, released a collection of essays examining political policy and socio-political issues in Sri Lanka. At the book launch, a discussion on Sri Lanka's political landscape took place, with attendees noting Sri Lanka's struggle to find a national identity not based on its past, but future potential. Concerns were raised about the country's centre-left politics, which were described as having lost the ability to mobilise popular support. Suggestions for revitalising this political philosophy included targeting youth voters and focusing on a single, progressive issue like healthcare or education. It was also suggested that intellectuals could play a key role in forging a renewed, progressive centre-left movement.
