    "Bala was a colourful yet controversial figure who was admired by some and despised by others",
    "It was a life of hardship and sacrifice then with Balasingham having to work, study and care for his ailing wife. She died in November 1976",
    "I felt that he may have been compelled to turn against me publicly in order to safeguard himself within the LTTE",
    "The\u00a0 current controversy surrounding Speaker Ashoka Sapumal Ranwala\u2019s higher educational qualifications\u00a0 evoke memories of an earlier controversy of a similar\u00a0 nature concerning a prominent person associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE).\u00a0 The rumpus then was about the LTTE political strategist Anton Stanislaus Balasingham who was frequently referred to as Dr.Balasingham in the media. This was widely disputed by members of organisations opposed to the LTTE. It was\u00a0 said that Balasingham had never acquired a doctoral degree and was therefore\u00a0 a \u201cpretender doctor\u201d.",
    "Tamil journalist and chief political strategist Anton Balasingham.",
    "What had happened then was as follows.. AB Stanislaus as Balasingham had graduated from Peradeniya University with a BA degree. Balasingham later went\u00a0 to Britain\u00a0 where he obtained an MA from the South Bank London Polytechnic. His dissertation was on the psychology of Marxism. Thereafter he began reading for his PhD partaking to Marx\u2019s theory of alienation in sociology under Prof. John Taylor. Balasingham never completed his doctoral studies as he got involved in the politics of Tamil liberation.",
    "Balasingham relocated to India after the July 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom and functioned as the LTTE\u2019s political strategist, negotiator and spokesperson.",
    "The Indian media, followed by the international media began referring to him as \u2018Dr.Balasingham\u2019. In fairness to Balasingham it must be said that the LTTE strategist never ever called himself a \u2018Dr\u2019. But he did not make any effort to correct media reports calling him \u2018Dr\u2019 either.",
    "The fact that Balasingham had no doctoral degree was conclusively proved later. Ironically, this was not done by his detractors from rival groups. It was instead an own goal of sorts. In those days the LTTE organisation in London was split in two factions. One was under Balasingham and the other under Seevaratnam, an accountant hailing from Myliddy in Sri Lanka. Seevaratnam ran a fortnightly called \u2018Tamil Voice International\u2019. A question was posed by a reader to the journal about Balasingham\u2019s doctoral qualifications. The detailed answer by the editors clearly explained the true position.",
    "It is against this backdrop that this column focuses this week on Anton Stanislaus Balasingham whose 18th death anniversary is on December 14. Balasingham, known as Bala \u2018Annai\u2019(elder brother) was a colourful yet controversial figure who was admired by some and despised by others.",
    "This writer\u2019s relationship with Balasingham too has had its twists and turns. I have both criticised and praised him depending of course on the issue at hand. Likewise he too had both spoken and written ill and well of me. I have written about this man and his role in Tamil affairs on several occasions. I shall rely on some of these writings while focusing on the professional-personal relationship between \u2018Bala Annai\u2019 and myself in this article.",
    "Balasingham was born on 4 March 1938. His father was from the East and mother from the North. His mother was a Christian and father a Hindu. Balasingham\u2019s grandfather was a \u201csaivakurukkal\u201d (non-Brahmin priest) from Mandur in Batticaloa District. His father was an electrical foreman at the Batticaloa Hospital. Bala\u2019s mother was from Jaffna town and a former resident of Martin\u2019s Road. She was a midwife by profession and was working at the Batticaloa Hospital when she met, loved and married Bala\u2019s father Balasingham Snr.",
    "She was later separated and then widowed at an early age. Balasingham along with mother and elder sister moved to the North as a child. They settled down at Karaveddy in the Vadamaratchy sector. Bala\u2019s mother worked as a midwife at the \u2018Ambam clinic\u2019 in Karaveddy. Two of Balasingham\u2019s nephews Victor and Anton were working at the \u2018Virakesari\u2019 composing section during the time I was a journalist at the Tamil newspaper.",
    "Incidentally my mother too was from Kaddaively in the greater Karaveddy area. The postal address was Thunnalai South, Karaveddy. In later years, Balasingham would often emphasise this and declare that he and I were from the same place.",
    "In his childhood and early youth, Balasingham was known as A.B. Stanislaus. The doyen of Tamil cartoonists Sivagnanasundaram known as \u2018Sundar\u2019 who ran the reputed magazine \u2018Sirithiran\u2019 was also from Karaveddy. It was due to Sivagnasundaram\u2019s efforts that Stanislaus was appointed Sub Editor at the Colombo Tamil newspaper \u2018Virakesari\u2019 in the early 60s.",
    "Former colleagues at the Virakesari speak of Stanny as a man engrossed in reading most of the time. He was not concerned about his appearance and not very particular about clothes. At the Virakesari, Stanislaus was soon put in charge of foreign news. This entailed translation of Reuters copy and other articles on foreign affairs.",
    "Things changed soon as Stanislaus got a job as translator at the British High Commission. There was a transformation in his appearance as he opted for smart clothes now. This was not entirely due to the new job alone, as cupid too had struck. He was enamoured of a beautiful Tamil woman at the British Council adjacent then to the BHC. She was Pearl Rasaratnam, the daughter of Rasaratnam master at Hartley College, Point Pedro.",
    "The family was well-known to my mother\u2019s family. I remember addressing Pearl as \u2018Poo aunty\u2019 in my childhood. One of my sisters was a flower girl at the wedding of Pearl\u2019s sister Rathi. The elder sister Nesam and my mother taught at the same school for many years The romance between Pearl and Anton resulted in their marriage on July 16 1968 at the Methodist Church in Kollupitiya.",
    "The post-marriage happiness of the newly-wed Balasingham was short-lived. Anton\u2019s wife Pearl became extremely ill, requiring advanced treatment abroad. British authorities were very sympathetic and generous. Both were allowed to go to England. They left Sri Lanka on August 3 1971. Balasingham continued his higher education in England. But his wife\u2019s condition deteriorated. It was a life of hardship and sacrifice then with Balasingham having to work, study and care for his ailing wife. She died in November 1976.",
    "Balasingham became acquainted with a hospital staff nurse who was also a \u2018stranger\u2019 in Britain as she was from Australia. A second romance flourished between the young widower Anton and the nurse Adele Anne Wilby. They married very simply at the Registrar\u2019s office in Brixton, South London on 1 September 1978.",
    "Balasingham teamed up with the LTTE in 1978. He did a lot of writing for the Tigers from London while paying periodic visits to India. When the LTTE broke up in 1980, he aligned himself with the Prabhakaran faction. Balasingham and wife Adele relocated to Chennai (then Madras) after the July 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom.",
    "After entering journalism by joining the Tamil daily \u2018Virakesari\u2019 in 1977, I moved to the English daily \u2018The Island\u2019 when it was launched in 1981. In 1984/5, I was given the assignment of obtaining interviews from Sri Lankan Tamil militant leaders based in India by Vijitha Yapa who was the Editor at that time. In Tamil Nadu, I met with most militant groups but the LTTE was playing hard to get. Finally I was asked to be at a particular spot near the Kannagi statue along the Marina beach at 5:30 p.m. I complied.",
    "A vehicle drew up at 5:30 p.m. sharp and the LTTE stalwart \u2018Nesan\u2019 (an ex-seminarian) driving the vehicle asked me to get in front. He then drove the car to another spot and parked. After a while another vehicle came up behind. A man got down and walked up to our vehicle and seated himself behind. As I turned around, he stretched his hand out and said, \u201cI am Balasingham.\u201d",
    "Nesan then began driving the vehicle in a seemingly aimless fashion through many roads and streets. Balasingham kept quizzing me in a curt manner. The hostile questions indicated he was suspicious of me. I changed track and told him about my family and his deceased wife\u2019s family. I also said, \u201cLike you, I too worked at the \u2018Virakesari\u2019.\u201d Balasingham\u2019s attitude changed. He beamed and said, \u201cSo you are one of us.\u201d He told Nesan, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Buhari Hotel.\u201d So we went to the Muslim restaurant and had a biriyani dinner while exchanging reminiscences about the past and discussing current politics. This was my first meeting with Balasingham. There were many thereafter.",
    "In 1988 I left for the USA on a Nieman Fellowship for Journalism at Harvard University. I later moved to Canada in 1989 and began editing a Tamil weekly from 1990 onwards in Toronto. I was critical of the LTTE after the Tigers broke the ceasefire with the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government in April 1995 and declared war.",
    "For this I paid a price as the Tigers in Canada started a campaign against the Tamil weekly \u2018Muncharie\u2019 owned and edited by me in Toronto. They \u2018banned\u2019 it. When the spate of death threats did not deter me, the Tigers began to target the Tamil-owned shops selling the paper and also the predominantly Tamil advertisers.",
    "The 48-page tabloid priced at a dollar had 22 pages of advertisement and sold 4,500-5,000 copies. Thanks to the Tiger intimidation and threats many shops stopped selling the paper. The paper shrunk to 24 pages with two pages of advertisements.Sales plummeted to three digits. Rather than survive on my knees by toeing the LTTE line, I opted to die on my feet and stopped publishing in April 1996.",
    "The paper being stopped was a huge financial blow at that time. Still the demise of \u2018Muncharie\u2019 was a blessing in disguise for me as I re-entered English journalism again. I went back to English journalism again by writing for \u2018The Island\u2019 and later \u2018The Sunday Leader,\u2019 \u2018The Nation\u2019 and now the \u2018Daily Mirror\u2019 and \u2018Daily Financial Times\u2019.",
    "The new millennium brought a surprise. The Tamil Catholic priest Fr. S.J. Emmanuel came to Toronto in mid 2000 and got in touch with me. He said that Balasingham in London wanted to talk to me. This led to my establishing contact with Balasingham again. I had lost contact with him after I left Sri Lanka. However I had earlier \u2018scooped\u2019 the news about Balasingham\u2019s return to London from the Wanni in 1999.",
    "While conversing after many years, Balasingham told me that he agreed with my view that the Tamil people needed to end the war and embrace peace with equal rights through a negotiated settlement. \u2018Bala Annai\u2019 said that he was working out a peace process with the help of Norway and wanted me to support it through my writings. I was then writing for \u2018The Sunday Leader\u2019.",
    "When I informed the editor and close friend Lasantha Wickrematunge, he was very happy and said the newspaper will back all efforts to bring about a successful settlement. Thereafter, I was in regular contact with Balasingham. There were many occasions where we would spend hours talking off the record. I learnt a lot about the inner workings of the LTTE and its evolution and growth through those conversations.",
    "The ceasefire facilitated by Oslo came into force from February 23 2002. I was very happy initially. Soon I found the LTTE behaving in a manner that was not conducive to a genuine peaceful settlement. When I remonstrated with Balasingham, I found him unresponsive to my complaints and slowly he began avoiding me.",
    "I waited for six months thinking the LTTE must be given time to get accustomed to a peace process. When that did not happen I began to be critical of the negative acts of omission and commission by the LTTE. Soon I realised that the LTTE was not genuine about peace talks. These thoughts were reflected in my columns.",
    "Balasingham was angry. He \u2018advised\u2019 Lasantha not to carry my columns as that could affect the paper\u2019s standing with Tamil readers. Lasantha told me of this and said, \u2018Carry on as usual, Machan\u2019. I continued and later Balasingham went on to attack me by name at press conferences and at public meetings. All communication between us ceased. Balasingham even instigated sycophantic Tamil editors to attack me viciously in print.",
    "A few years later in the third week of November 2006 I received a telephone call from London. It was from Balasingham. I was surprised as we were not on speaking terms for about three years due to our\u00a0 political differences. I was however happy to talk to \u2018Bala Annai\u2019 because I had heard earlier that he was terminally ill and that his days were numbered.",
    "Bala Annai said at the outset that he was telephoning and talking to some of his old colleagues, friends and contacts. Although he did not explicitly say so, I realised that it was a farewell call from a man who was to \u2018go out gently into that good night\u2019 soon. He had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), a rare and aggressive malignancy of the biliary system. It was in an advanced state and the doctors had given him about four to six more weeks.",
    "Balasingham was his customary jovial self with his jokes and jibes. As the conversation progressed, I sensed that he was seriously worried. It was certainly not over his impending death but something else. Soon it came blurting out: \u201cThambikkuoruIlavumvilanguthillai. Nilaimai Padumoasamaahuthu. Muzhu Ulagamum Saernthu Puligalai Mongappoaguthu\u201d (younger brother is not understanding anything. The situation is becoming worse. The whole world will get together and clobber the Tigers). \u2018Younger brother\u2019 referred to LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran who was known as \u2018Thamby\u2019 to those of an earlier vintage.",
    "Balasingham went on to say that the so-called international community was infuriated at the conduct of the LTTE. Unless the Tigers did an urgent course correction and acted in an acceptable manner, the Western nations, China, Japan, Pakistan and India were going to back the Rajapaksa regime and ensure that the LTTE was militarily defeated and destroyed. I asked Balasingham as to why he was unable to make Prabhakaran see the writing on the wall and act accordingly. Bala Annai replied ruefully that he had tried, many times and failed.",
    "When I asked Balasingham whether he did not try to make other senior LTTE leaders understand the situation, he replied that people like Thamilselvan, Castro, Pottu Ammaan in the Wanni and Ruthirakumaaran in New York had prejudiced Prabhakaran\u2019s mind against him after the Oslo facilitated peace talks between the Ranil Wickremesinghe government and LTTE.",
    "Moreover, they had also misinformed Prabhakaran into believing that the Sri Lankan armed forces could be defeated and that the world would back the Tigers against Rajapaksa. Balasingham also said that senior leaders like Soosai, \u2018Baby\u2019 Subramaniam, Balakumaran and Para understood the predicament but were powerless to persuade Prabhakaran to see reality.",
    "We had talked for about 20 minutes when Balasingham started to cough ceaselessly. He could not continue further and we had to end our conversation. I was extremely saddened by the conversation as I could see that escalation of the war was going to be inevitable.",
    "That final conversation with Balasingham also cleared up a lot of things for me. Chief among them was the \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 (to put it mildly) I had with him. He made me understand through that conversation that he had indeed been genuine about a negotiated settlement but was overruled by Prabhakaran as events unfolded.",
    "I did not ask him why he had attacked me publicly or tried to stop me from writing for The Sunday Leader. I felt it was not to do so, as the man was dying.",
    "However, I felt that he may have been compelled to turn against me publicly in order to safeguard himself within the LTTE. Thamilselvan and Castro were conducting a vicious campaign within the overseas LTTE against me at that time and it was quite possible that Balasingham was vulnerable on account of the close contact he maintained with me in earlier times.",
    "Anton Stanislaus Balasingham passed away peacefully in his South London residence at 1:45 p.m. (British time) on Thursday, December 14 2006. His loving and devoted Australian born wife Adele Anne was by his side as \u2018Bala Annai\u2019 took his last breath. The funeral was held at the Alexandra Palace in London on December 20 2006. LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran conferred the title \u2018Thesathin Kural\u2019 (Voice of the Nation) upon Tiger ideologue and political strategist posthumously.",
    "All these memories and thoughts about the relationship I had with him arise again as the 18th death anniversary of Anton Balasingham draws near on December 14 this year.",
