    "Everyone is panicking because AI is very bad; everyone is panicking because AI is very good. It\u2019s just that you never know which one you\u2019re going to get. Grok is a pornography machine. Claude Code can do anything from building websites to reading your MRI. So of course Gen Z is spooked by what this means for jobs. Unnerving new research says AI is going to have a seismic impact on the labor market this year.  If you want to get a handle on all that, don\u2019t expect any help from the AI companies\u2014they\u2019re turning on each other like it\u2019s the last act in a zombie movie. Meta\u2019s former chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is spilling tea, while Big Tech\u2019s messiest exes, Elon Musk and OpenAI, are about to go to trial. Grab your popcorn."
