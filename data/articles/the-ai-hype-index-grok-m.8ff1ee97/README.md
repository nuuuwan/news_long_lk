Everyone is panicking because AI is very bad; everyone is panicking because AI is very good. It’s just that you never know which one you’re going to get. Grok is a pornography machine. Claude Code can do anything from building websites to reading your MRI. So of course Gen Z is spooked by what this means for jobs. Unnerving new research says AI is going to have a seismic impact on the labor market this year.  If you want to get a handle on all that, don’t expect any help from the AI companies—they’re turning on each other like it’s the last act in a zombie movie. Meta’s former chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is spilling tea, while Big Tech’s messiest exes, Elon Musk and OpenAI, are about to go to trial. Grab your popcorn.
