The UN Human Rights Council has been issuing annual reports on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka since 2012, but the Sri Lanka government has tended to reject its findings. Tamil politicians have consistently supported the reports, repeating their demands for an international mechanism to hold those accountable for war crimes and human rights violations perpetrated during the conflict between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE. Tamil politicians have been calling for this for the past 50 years. Despite this, the situation has changed very little, with thousands having lost their lives and suffered displacement during the war. However, the international community is hesitant to intervene decisively. Recently, India's External Affairs Minister advised Tamils in Sri Lanka to seize newly opened opportunities. Yet, the Sri Lankan government has failed to make significant progress despite establishing commissions and committees to investigate the issues.
