    "Sri Lankan restaurant \u2018Paradise\u2019, was established five years ago in London, and was born out of a desire to showcase authentic fiery island flavours with a modern twist. For the restaurant\u2019s founder, Chef Dom Fernando, who played a key role in the culinary art events at the Galle Literary Festival 2025, \u2018authenticity is at the heart of everything he does.\u2019",
    "Born in London to Sri Lankan parents, for Dom Fernando (42), meal times were a main focus, especially with his grandmother making the most delicious dishes. Dom says her influence has been a constant in his life, and it is her flavours that are woven into Paradise\u2019s dishes, still to this day.",
    "A veteran in his field with 14 years in the hospitality trade, Dom has held a variety of group leadership roles at both InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) and Hilton International. But his love affair with cooking and spice began at an early age when he wandered around street food stalls in Sri Lanka during his family visits. The explosion of spice, heat, freshness and sweetness intertwined, is what inspired him to realise his dream of opening his own restaurant and in 2019, Paradise was born, to critical acclaim. Dom says that what Paradise offers isn\u2019t \u2018fusion,\u2019 but a reinterpretation of traditional dishes through contemporary techniques, using Sri Lankan and British produce. \u201cTake the mutton roll, for example, a beloved Sri Lankan street snack. In London, we maintain the core flavours but reimagine the dish using raw mutton tartare, dressed with traditional spices, and presented in an elegant, minimalist style. It\u2019s about challenging perceptions,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople in London know the traditional mutton roll, but when we serve it this way, it surprises them\u2014and yet, it\u2019s still unmistakably Sri Lankan.\u201d",
    "The process: Where tradition meets technique",
    "What differentiates Chef Dom Fernando isn\u2019t just the presentation but the meticulous process behind each dish. While Sri Lankan home cooking often embraces a \u2018one-pot\u2019 approach, adding all ingredients together and letting them simmer, Paradise employs layered techniques borrowed from global culinary practices.",
    "\u201cFor example, in a traditional Sri Lankan curry, you\u2019d cook the fish directly in the sauce. We take it a step further\u2014we make a seafood stock from scratch, infuse it with spices, then blend and strain it to create a smooth, intensely flavoured base. We even vacuum-seal our curries to let the flavours develop over a few days before serving. It\u2019s not about changing the dish; it\u2019s about amplifying what\u2019s already there.\u201d",
    "But he\u2019s quick to dispel the notion that this is about \u2018elevating\u2019 Sri Lankan cuisine, as if traditional methods are lacking. \u201cWe\u2019re not reinventing the wheel. We\u2019re just exploring different ways to showcase our food, using techniques that have been around for decades in other parts of the world.\u201d",
    "Food as culture: The intersection with literature and art",
    "For Dom, food doesn\u2019t exist in isolation\u2014it\u2019s part of a larger cultural ecosystem, the reason why he strongly supports events like the Galle Literary Festival.",
    "\u201cFood, literature, art\u2014they\u2019re all connected,\u201d he says. \u201cDining today isn\u2019t just about the food on your plate. It\u2019s about the story behind the dish, the design of the space, the narrative woven into every element of the experience.\u201d",
    "He draws parallels between the festival\u2019s mission and his own work. \u201cThe Galle Literary Festival pushes boundaries, challenges perceptions, and fosters dialogue. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do with Sri Lankan food\u2014to create conversations, spark curiosity, and shift how people see our cuisine.\u201d",
    "When Dom Fernando opened Paradise in London, he wasn\u2019t just launching another restaurant. He was crafting a story\u2014one told through flavours, textures, and the rich cultural tapestry of Sri Lanka. Through Paradise and other ventures, he hopes to create spaces where Sri Lankans can thrive without feeling the need to emigrate. \u201cHospitality is in the Sri Lankan DNA. But what\u2019s missing are the skills and training to deliver world-class service. That\u2019s where I want to make a difference.\u201d",
    "Dom recently launched a Mexican food pop-up in Ahangama and served his creations to an appreciative audience at the Galle Literary Festival. He is also in the process of getting ready to launch Open Door Policy, an 11-seater immersive Sri Lankan chef\u2019s table experience to Sri Lanka to a permanent location in Colombo 3. \u201cWe will source everything locally\u2014working with farmers in the north and partnering with small producers. We\u2019re all about creating sustainable ecosystems.\u201d",
    "As he looks to come back to his roots with new ventures on the island, Dom reflects on the evolution of Sri Lankan cuisine, the importance of cultural connection, and his vision for inspiring the next generation. He is passionate about reversing the trend of young Sri Lankans seeking opportunities abroad. \u201cWhen I visit, people often ask, \u2018Can you get me a job in London?\u2019 And I tell them\u2014yes, I could, but why? The UK is expensive, challenging, and honestly, not as glamorous as you think. There are incredible opportunities right here if you\u2019re willing to work for them.\u201d",
    "Sweet ambitions: Reimagining Sri Lankan desserts",
    "Sri Lankan cuisine is often celebrated for its bold, savoury flavours\u2014fiery curries, aromatic sambols, and fragrant rice dishes. But when it comes to desserts, the narrative tends to become simpler\u2014the watalappan, ice cream and jelly. For Dom, this presented both a challenge and an opportunity.",
    "\u201cSri Lankan food culture is heavily savoury-driven,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut we\u2019re a nation with a serious sweet tooth, we just don\u2019t always reflect that in our traditional desserts.\u201d",
    "From the beginning, desserts were central to Dom\u2019s vision for his first project Paradise. \u201cI\u2019ve got a sweet tooth, and I believe the final dish should leave a lasting impression. We started with a version of watalappan gelato\u2014authentic in flavour but presented differently. Over the years, we\u2019ve evolved, asking, what\u2019s the next generation of Sri Lankan desserts?\u201d",
    "He says it\u2019s about balance: acidity, sweetness, texture. After a hearty Sri Lankan meal, diners crave something light and refreshing. One of Paradise\u2019s latest creations is a testament to this philosophy\u2014a delicate cream made from buffalo curd, Somerset cheese, and paneer, whipped into airy perfection using an iSi gun. \u201cIt\u2019s creamy, slightly tangy, and not overly sweet. It\u2019s about elevating familiar flavours in unexpected ways.\u201d",
    "Dom sees the lack of a deep-rooted dessert tradition not as a limitation but as a blank canvas. \u201cWe\u2019re not bound by centuries of \u2018this is how it\u2019s always been done.\u2019 That gives us the freedom to innovate.\u201d",
    "A culinary map: Exploring Sri Lanka\u2019s regional diversity",
    "While Paradise\u2019s London menu nods to familiar Sri Lankan staples. Over the past five years, Dom and his team have made regular trips to Sri Lanka, exploring different regions, spice blends, and cooking techniques. But, he admits, these explorations have only scratched the surface.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s one reason I\u2019m here more often now,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to go deeper\u2014cook with families, learn from home cooks, understand not just how dishes are made but why certain methods and flavours exist.\u201d",
    "This passion for regional exploration will be at the heart of Dom\u2019s next venture: Open Door Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a space where we can showcase regional Sri Lankan dishes with a modern twist. But it\u2019s a process\u2014it takes time to honour these traditions while presenting them in new ways.\u201d",
    "Rooted in Sri Lanka: A message to the next generation",
    "Beyond the food, Dom\u2019s journey is about identity and belonging. Having lived abroad, he understands the allure of opportunities elsewhere. But he also sees the untapped potential within Sri Lanka\u2014a potential he hopes to showcase not just through his restaurants but through his message to the country\u2019s youth.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think the grass is greener elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much here\u2014culture, history, incredible produce, and talent. We just need to believe in it.\u201d",
    "For Dom, nurturing this mindset requires a multi-faceted approach. First, he emphasises reconnecting with culture, noting that \u201cfood is communal in Sri Lanka. We love gathering, sharing meals, and telling stories. That\u2019s a powerful cultural asset\u2014we need to celebrate it.\u201d He also highlights the importance of valuing local ingredients, pointing out that \u201cSri Lanka has phenomenal produce, but much of it is exported. That drives up prices locally and limits access. We need to rethink how we value and consume what\u2019s grown here.\u201d",
    "Additionally, Dom advocates for inspiring through media, pointing to shows like MasterChef and Chef\u2019s Table that have changed how people view food careers globally. \u201cWe need to create that kind of cultural excitement here. Are we preparing young Sri Lankans to compete on a global level, or are we stuck in outdated models? Hospitality has evolved dramatically over the last 20 years. Our education system needs to reflect that.\u201d",
    "Finally, he suggests leveraging culinary tourism, noting that countries like Thailand and Indonesia have turned food into a major tourism driver. Why not Sri Lanka? He asks, given that we have the flavours, the culture, and the stories. \u201cIt just needs to be packaged in ways that will attract the world.\u201d",
    "Paradise with a purpose",
    "Dom Fernando\u2019s journey is more than a mere business expansion. It\u2019s a cultural mission\u2014a quest to redefine what Sri Lankan cuisine can be, both at home and overseas. Through his restaurants, he\u2019s not just serving food; but telling stories, challenging perceptions, and creating spaces where the Sri Lankan identity can flourish.",
    "\u201cWhen people dine at Paradise,\u201d he says, \u201cI want them to leave curious\u2014not just about the food, but about Sri Lanka itself. I want them to think, I need to go there and taste this for myself. That\u2019s the real goal.\u201d",
    "In a world where culinary traditions can easily become static, Dom\u2019s vision is clear: to keep the conversation going, one plate at a time."
