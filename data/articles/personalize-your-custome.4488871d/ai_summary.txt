Advertising often fails to match customers' needs and preferences, with over half of surveyed consumers stating that brand personalisation did not meet their needs, according to Deloitte Digital. The study found that customers were more likely to purchase from a brand offering personalised experiences, but many find a lack of alignment between businesses' provided personalisation and their desires. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to personalise commerce, tailoring shopping experiences to the customer using real-time data, can help businesses improve this. AI can predict what a customer may want to buy using machine learning and can provide hyper-personalised product recommendations. It can also simplify the checkout process by predicting and autofilling shipping and billing information. However, customers must trust that businesses will not misuse their data for this to be effective.
