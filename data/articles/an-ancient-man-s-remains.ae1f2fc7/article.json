To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here. This week I\u2019ve been working on a story about a brain of glass. About five years ago, archaeologists found shiny black glass fragments inside the skull of a man who died in the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 CE. It seems they are pieces of brain, turned to glass. Related StoryHow a volcanic eruption turned a human brain into glassFragments from the brain of a man killed by the Mount Vesuvius eruption in the year 79 are smooth and shiny but still contain visible neurons.",
    "Scientists have found ancient brains before\u2014some are thought to be at least 10,000 years old. But this is the only time they\u2019ve seen a brain turn to glass. They\u2019ve even been able to spot neurons inside it. The man\u2019s remains were found at Herculaneum, an ancient city that was buried under meters of volcanic ash following the eruption. We don\u2019t know if there are any other vitrified brains on the site. None have been found so far, but only about a quarter of the city has been excavated.",
    "Some archaeologists want to continue excavating the site. But others argue that we need to protect it. Further digging will expose it to the elements, putting the artifacts and remains at risk of damage. You can only excavate a site once, so perhaps it\u2019s worth waiting until we have the technology to do so in the least destructive way. After all, there are some pretty recent horror stories of excavations involving angle grinders, and of ancient body parts ending up in garages. Future technologies might eventually make our current approaches look similarly barbaric.",
    "The inescapable fact of fields like archaeology or paleontology is this: When you study ancient remains, you\u2019ll probably end up damaging them in some way. Take, for example, DNA analysis. Scientists have made a huge amount of progress in this field. Today, geneticists can crack the genetic code of extinct animals and analyze DNA in soil samples to piece together the history of an environment. But this kind of analysis essentially destroys the sample. To perform DNA analysis on human remains, scientists typically cut out a piece of bone and grind it up. They might use a tooth. But once it has been studied, that sample is gone for good. Archaeological excavations have been performed for hundreds of years, and as recently as the 1950s, it was common for archaeologists to completely excavate a site they discovered. But those digs cause damage too. Nowadays, when a site is discovered, archaeologists tend to focus on specific research questions they might want to answer, and excavate only enough to answer those questions, says Karl Harrison, a forensic archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the UK. \u201cWe will cross our fingers, excavate the minimal amount, and hope that the next generation of archaeologists will have new, better tools and finer abilities to work on stuff like this,\u201d he says.  In general, scientists have also become more careful with human remains. Matteo Borrini, a forensic anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, curates his university\u2019s collection of skeletal remains, which he says includes around 1,000 skeletons of medieval and Victorian Britons. The skeletons are extremely valuable for research, says Borrini, who himself has investigated the remains of one person who died from exposure to phosphorus in a match factory and another who was murdered. Related StoryWhat happens when you donate your body to scienceI visited a body farm and an anatomy lab to see what the process looks like at its best.",
    "When researchers ask to study the skeletons, Borrini will find out whether the research will somehow alter them. \u201cIf there is destructive sampling, we need to guarantee that the destruction will be minimal, and that there will be enough material [left] for further study,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise we don\u2019t authorize the study.\u201d If only previous generations of archaeologists had taken a similar approach. Harrison told me the story of the discovery of \u201cSt Bees man,\u201d a medieval man found in a lead coffin in Cumbria, UK, in 1981. The man, thought to have died in the 1300s, was found to be extraordinarily well preserved\u2014his skin was intact, his organs were present, and he even still had his body hair. Normally, archaeologists would dig up such ancient specimens with care, using tools made of natural substances like stone or brick, says Harrison. Not so for St Bees man. \u201cHis coffin was opened with an angle grinder,\u201d says Harrison. The man\u2019s body was removed and \u201cstuck in a truck,\u201d where he underwent a standard modern forensic postmortem, he adds.",
    "\u201cHis thorax would have been opened up, his organs [removed and] weighed, [and] the top of his head would have been cut off,\u201d says Harrison. Samples of the man\u2019s organs \u201cwere kept in [the pathologist\u2019s] garage for 40 years.\u201d If St Bees man were discovered today, the story would be completely different. The coffin itself would be recognized as a precious ancient artifact that should be handled with care, and the man\u2019s remains would be scanned and imaged in the least destructive way possible, says Harrison. Even Lindow man, who was discovered a mere three years later in nearby Manchester, got better treatment. His remains were found in a peat bog, and he is thought to have died over 2,000 years ago. Unlike poor St Bees man, he underwent careful scientific investigation, and his remains took pride of place in the British Museum. Harrison remembers going to see the exhibit when he was 10 years old.\u00a0 Harrison says he\u2019s dreaming of minimally destructive DNA technologies\u2014tools that might help us understand the lives of long-dead people without damaging their remains. I\u2019m looking forward to covering those in the future. (In the meantime, I\u2019m personally dreaming of a trip to\u2014respectfully and carefully\u2014visit Herculaneum.)  Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive Some believe an \u201cancient-DNA revolution\u201d is underway, as scientists use modern technologies to learn about human, animal, and environmental remains from the past. My colleague Antonio Regalado has the details in his recent feature. The piece was published in the latest edition of our magazine, which focuses on relationships. Ancient DNA analysis made it to MIT Technology Review\u2019s annual list of top 10 Breakthrough Technologies in 2023. You can read our thoughts on the breakthroughs of 2025 here.\u00a0 DNA that was frozen for 2 million years was sequenced in 2022. The ancient DNA fragments, which were recovered from Greenland, may offer insight into the environment of the polar desert at the time. Environmental DNA, also known as eDNA, can help scientists assemble a snapshot of all the organisms in a given place. Some are studying samples collected from Angkor Wat in Cambodia, which is believed to have been built in the 12th century.",
