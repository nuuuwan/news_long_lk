    "Verit\u00e9 Research notes that foreign lenders can help improve transparency by linking their project financing to government compliance with the RTI Act",
    "Large infrastructure projects of the government are often financed by foreign loans and grants. When the amount exceeds USD 100,000, the law requires information about the projects to be disclosed to the public online. However, compliance with the law is poor. In 2024, the government disclosed only 40% of the required information on foreign-financed projects, according to Verit\u00e9 Research.",
    "This had been revealed in the 2024 update of Infrastructure Watch, which is a dashboard on PublicFinance.LK \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s premier economic insights platform. This platform has tracked government compliance with the RTI Act\u2019s proactive disclosure requirements since 2022.",
    "Noting that corruption in public spending is often linked to public procurement, the statement added that the dashboard also shows that disclosure of procurement related information for foreign financed projects was even less \u2013 only 20% of what the law requires.",
    "Economist and Director at Verit\u00e9 Research Subhashini Abeysinghe had said that \u201cforeign lenders can help improve transparency by linking their project financing to government compliance with the Right to Information (RTI) Act\u201d.",
    "Improving transparency is not only in the interest of the Sri Lankan public but also benefits lenders and contractors involved in these projects. Abeysinghe had also stated that \u201cgreater transparency not only fosters fair competition and reduces the risk of corruption, but also minimises reputational risks for lenders and contractors of being implicated in corrupt practices.\u201d",
    "Section 9 of the RTI Act and the guidelines published by the RTI Commission mandate the proactive disclosure of information under five broad categories: project details, rationale and beneficiaries, budget and financial details, approvals and clearances, and procurement and contracts, the statement also said.",
