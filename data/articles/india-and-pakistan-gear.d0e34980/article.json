    "What\u2019s happened?On April 22nd a terrorist attack in India led to the death of at least 26\u00a0civilians, including a foreign tourist, and injured several others. The\u00a0attack, which occurred in Pahalgam, a\u00a0tourist spot in India\u2019s northernmost state of Jammu and Kashmir, was\u00a0carried out by a little-known militant group, the\u00a0Kashmir Resistance, which is an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (a\u00a0Pakistani Islamist jihadist organisation) that has expressed discontent about non-Kashmiris and non-Muslims settling in the region and spurring a \u201cdemographic change\u201d. India has blamed Pakistani terrorists and authorities for the attack\u2014a\u00a0claim denied by the Pakistan government. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, cut short a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to India in the wake of the\u00a0attack.Why does it matter?The attack will lead to a major escalation in hostilities between India and Pakistan,\u00a0who have shared a fraught relationship over the control of Kashmir for decades. EIU\u00a0assigns a moderate (20%) probability to a military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours breaking out in the next few\u00a0days.Our baseline view is that the Indian administration will resort to covert cross-border air strikes or conventional cruise-missile strikes,\u00a0following the pattern seen in 2016 and 2019 after previous terrorist attacks in India. Pakistan will probably respond with air raids, which could lead to aerial dogfights. Both sides will attempt to display strength, albeit falling short of a full-scale war, given the mutual nuclear threat. Strong public pressure in India to act decisively will make military action a political compulsion for the government. The\u00a0chief risk is a miscalculation on either side that could be a major trigger for a full-scale war. Meanwhile, Mr\u00a0Modi could suspend the ceasefire at the Line of Control (the\u00a0de\u00a0facto border in the disputed region of Kashmir), which could escalate cross-border fire at\u00a0outposts.The attack, which was one of the worst to have targeted civilians in India, will crush the booming tourism industry in Kashmir\u00a0in 2025-26, dealing a major blow to the local economy; the\u00a0region relies on tourism as a major source of its livelihood. This will amplify local discontent with the\u00a0ruling administration, and could worsen militant activity in the region as local youths join terrorist outfits.\u00a0Overall, the attack will worsen India\u2019s security outlook slightly,\u00a0though the impact will be limited to Kashmir, which is not a major business hub,\u00a0and will not deter broader interest in India from foreign\u00a0investors.India has already announced a slate of retaliatory measures against Pakistan,\u00a0stating that cross-border connections to the attack had been established. The\u00a0diplomatic relationship, which in any case was poor, has been further downgraded. India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, announced the expulsion of Pakistani military attaches, the\u00a0suspension of the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the immediate closure of the Attari land-transit post in the Indian state of Punjab, a\u00a0suspension and revocation of visas for Pakistani nationals and a reduction in the numerical strength of the Pakistani and Indian high commissions.\u00a0We\u00a0expect none of these measures to be revoked in 2025, and they are likely to be in effect for a sustained\u00a0period.Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and will start to prepare for any covert (or\u00a0overt) military action undertaken by India.\u00a0The\u00a0suspension of the Indus Water Treaty will adversely affect Pakistan\u2019s agrarian economy, especially as the sowing season begins soon and a large part of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab region depends on the Indus and its tributaries for irrigation. This\u00a0will further affect Pakistan\u2019s already weak economy. Any\u00a0military confrontation with India will mean greater damage, given the country\u2019s limited spending power to sustain a prolonged war. India could also look to abrogate the Treaty entirely under Article\u00a062 of the Vienna Convention, dealing a major blow to the agriculture sector in riparian lower\u00a0Pakistan.What next?Pakistani diplomats have been given a week to leave India, which hints at a potential timeline for India\u2019s actions against its neighbour. Resentment against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led national government will persist among the local Kashmiri Muslim population over the\u00a0abrogation of Article\u00a0370\u00a0in Kashmir. This move allowed local authorities to issue domicile certificates to outsiders, enabling them to apply for jobs and buy land. This\u00a0could result in recurrent attacks over time in an effort to pressurise the government to re-instate Kashmir\u2019s special status, although we do not expect any backtracking on this from the Indian administration. The\u00a0latest attack will prevent a return to normality in the Kashmir Valley, and will undermine the national government\u2019s development efforts in the region for a long time. Domestic security concerns may also be heightened for a while in India if communal clashes erupt in other parts of the\u00a0country.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
