Article Commemorating Rajinikanth’s 75th Birthday

Friday 12th December 2025 was a special day for millions of Tamil movie  fans.  It was the 75th  birthday of popular Tamil cinema actor Rajinikanth. The evergreen  filmstar has in a  film career  spanning fifty years ,acted in 172 films. He is currently working on his 173rd movie.

Even as  Rajinikanth fans celebrated the actor’s  diamond birthday on a widespread scale,they were  in turn provided with a special treat by their idol. A re-mastered version of the star’s 1999 film “Padayappa” was re-released 26 years later  on Dec 12. The 1999  film was a blockbuster produced by Rajinikanth himself under the aegis of Arunachala Cine creations. The re-released 2025  film is reportedly  a hit movie running to packed houses both in India  and overseas..

What is remarkable  about Rajinikanth   is the fact that he continues to act in lead roles despite being a septuagenarian.  Only Hindi cinema’s Dev Anand kept acting in lead roles even as an octogenarian but many of Dev Anand’s films  were failures in commercial terms.What is noteworthy about Rajinikanth is that his movies  continue to  be  hugely successful at the box office.

“Super Staaru  Yaarunnu Kaettaal, Sinnakuzhandhaiyum Sollum”is a hit number  from the Rajinikanth film “ Raja Chinna Roja” released in 1989. What the opening lines say is that  even a small child knows the answer to the question of who is the super star? What the words  mean implicitly   is that Rajinikanth is indeed the super star of Tamil films. One is adjudged super star on the basis of  being a box office draw and amount of remuneration received.

By that yardstick, Rajinikanth has indeed been the super star of Tamil cinema for many years. His films click loudly at the box office  and he  is paid a huge sum of money for a film. In recent times 51 year old actor Vijay has overtaken the 75 year old Rajinikanth in terms of earnings.  Nevertheless the moniker Superstar still refers to Rajinikanth in the realm of Tamil moviedom.  Nowithstanding actor Vijay,  the Superstar,” as Rajini  is known, is still the single most popular mass figure among actors in Tamil cinema.

Rajini’s fans are generally youths and women. However most of his youthful die-hard fans are now in their naughty forties,nifty-fifties and sprightly sixties but their fondness for Rajinikanth is as ageless as ever. The actor is pop[ular among Sri Lankan film theatre audiences too and has an established  fan base  comprising  Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese.

The Rajanikanth saga is a rags to riches story.It is the tale of how a Bus Conductor  Shivaji Rao from Bengaluru in India’s Karnataka state came to the Tamil Nadu state capital Chennai and became the  celebrated cinema super star Rajinikanth. It is against this backdrop therefore that this column moves away from politics this week and focuses on  superstar Rajinikanth.

Interestingly, Rajinikanth,  though  a highly popular actor in Tamil cinema,  is ethnically not a Tamil. He is not even a South Indian. Though born in Bangalore, now known as Bengaluru. Rajinikanth is a Maratha whose family hails from Mavadi Kadepathar in the State of Maharashtra. His given name is Shivaji Rao Gaekwad.

The Gaekwads are of Kshatriya warrior clan lineage. His family moved to Bangalore/Bengaluru in the southern state of Karnataka during the British period. Rajini’s given name at birth Shivaji Rao was derived from the legendary Maratha warrior-king ‘Chatrapathi Shivaji Rao.

Shivaji Rao Gaekwad was born  on 12 December 1950 at the Vanivilas hospital on Krishnarajendra road in Bengaluru. His father Ranoji Rao was a Police constable and mother Ramabai a homemaker. Shivaji was the youngest of four siblings. He lost his mother at the age of nine. The sister Aswath Balubai looked after him like a foster mother.The family lived in the Bengaluru suburb of  Hanumantha Nagar.

Young Shivaji Rao Gaekward completed his primary schooling at Gavipuram Govt Kannada Model Primary school and his secondary education art the Aachaarya Pathsala Public school. After completing his secondary education  with a Pre-university certificate(PUC),Shivaji  gave up studies  saying he was not interested in higher education.

Shivaji Rao  acted in many dramas during school days. He realised that he had a flair for acting. After leaving school he started acting in Kannada stage plays. Acting in amateurish dramas did not pay well. Shivaji tried his hand at many  day jobs  while appearing on stage in the evenings. He was  at times a carpenter, office peon, machine operator and a coolie  transporting sacks of rice and flour.

Bangalore Transport Service

At the age of 20 ,Shivaji sat for an entrance exam conducted by the then Bangalore Transport Service(BTS) and was selected as a bus conductor. It was then that he met Raja Baadhar , the man described as Rajinikanth’s best friend. Raja Baadhar was the driver of the bus on which Shivaji was the conductor. They worked an eight hour shift from 6 am to 2 pm daily. The driver -conductor duo of Raja Baadhar-Shivaji Rao  hit it off well and both became close friends.

The following paragraphs excerpted from the book “Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography” by Naman Ramachandran. The paragraphs quoting Raja Baadhar  provide an insight into how the Bengaluru bus conductor “worked” then.

“There was no one faster than him in issuing tickets,’ remembers Baadhar. ‘He would give out tickets with a flourish, return change in style. It was all about style. Passengers would look on in amazement.’ Laughingly, he adds, ‘He would always flick back his forelock in those days, that’s why he is bald today.”

“Passengers would let earlier buses go empty and wait for the bus where the entertaining conductor was on duty and crowd in. Shivaji definitely knew how to work a crowd and play to the gallery even then.”

Madras Film Institute

Meanwhile Shivaji Rao’s popularity as an amateur stage actor increased. Many started suggesting that he should get trained and  move from stage to screen. Among these was a woman medical  student named Nirmala. She was an ardent fan. Nirmala obtained admission forms to the Madras film institute without Shivaji’s knowledge and filled them up. The ball was now in Shivaji’s court.

After much deliberation, Shivaji Rao decided to take the plunge by enrolling for the acting course  His elder brother Satyanarayana Rao and best friend Raja Baadhar encouraged him in this.They also backed him financially.

Shivaji Rao gained admission to the Madras Film Institute known earlier the Adyar film institute and presently  as the MGR Govt Film and Television Training Institute.Shivaji Rao followed a two year acting course at the Madras Film Institute from 1973 to 1975. He underwent great financial difficulties while studying. Since he was generally low on funds, Shivaji was compelled to skip meals regularly to make ends meet. He passed out in 1975.

Even as a film institute student, Shivaji caught the eye of renowned film maker K.Balachander when he delivered a guest lecture to the acting class. So when Balachander made  the film “Apoorva  Raagangal”(rare melodies), he offered Shivaji Rao a small but significant role in the film. While speaking about his choice later,  Balachander was to say “ Of course when I introduced him in Apoorva Raagangal, it was only a small role, but people would remember him because he comes in the climax. So I thought, I’ll give this particular role to him.”

“Apoorva  Raagangal” was released on 15 August 1975. It was the film debut of Shivaji Rao in his new Avatar Rajinikanth. Balachander advised the actor to adopt a new screen name and recommended the name Rajinikanth. Incidently Rajinikanth was the name of the role played by actor AVM Rajan in the film “Major Chandrakanth”directed by Balachander in 1967.  The film’s titles said “Arimukam” ”(introduction)Rajinikanth”, Rajinikanth played Pandiyan the husband of the heroine Sri Vidhya.

Rajinikanth’s  entrance  in the film was quite dramatic as he pushed open the gates and walked in. “Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive.” Wrote “The Hindu”in its review. Hence 2025 also marks the 50th anniversary of Rajinikanth’s  acting career.

Rajinikanth was given further boosts by K Balachander  who gave him three minor roles in three consecutive films. While Balachander continued to give Rajinikanth roles in the Tamil and Telugu films directed by him,other filmmakers too followed suit. In the early stages Rajinikanth played somewhat negative roles in films like “Moondru mudichugal”and “Pathinaaru  Vayathiiley”.. The trend changed with films like  “Puvanaa oru  Kaelvikkuri” and “Bairavi”.Gradually Rajini  began getting positive roles. Soon he started playing lead roles.

Films starring Rajinikanth became commercial successes. Producers began flocking to him. The prestigious AVM studios  produced nine films with Rajinikanth. Rajini started acting day and night in films.  He averaged about 20 films a year working at times in three shifts. The strain was too much and Rajini suffered a minor nervous breakdown. He recovered soon and continued to act but at  a more leisurely pace.

.Rajinikanth also   decided to settle down and got  married to Latha Rangachchaary, a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar woman. Rajinikanth first met Latha a student at the Ethiraj College for women when she interviewed him for the College magazine. Latha’s sister is married to actor YG Mahendran..Her brother’s son Anirudh Ravichandran is a leading music composer -director.

Latha and Rajinikanth were married on 26 February 1981. They have two daughters, Aishwarya and Soundarya, Both have directed and produced films. Elder daughter  Aishwarya was married to popular film actor Dhanush . They separated some years ago and got divorced recently.Younger daughter Soundharya was married to an industrialist Ashwin Ramkumar. They got divorced in 2017. Soundharya got married again in 2019 to actor-businessman Visaghan Vanangamudi, Rajinikanth and Latha have four grand children from their two daughters.

Villain, Anti-hero, Hero

Rajinikanth’s  journey as an actor  was from villain to anti-hero to hero. Rajinikanth began captivating film goers with his smart appearance, stylish movements, novel mannerisms, rapid manner of dialogue delivery and a striking penchant for uttering punchy one-liners.

Rajini’s  stock began to rise from 1980 onwards and very soon the ex-bus conductor’s movies began breaking box-office records. The well known film producer “Kalaippuli”  Thaanu was the first to proclaim  Rajinikanth as  the “Superstar” of Tamil cinema.

“Reel” Looks- “Real” Looks

An interesting aspect of Rajinikanth’s personality is that unlike most cinema stars he does not wear make-up or appear to be young looking in real life. He does not try to lighten his dark tone skin or wear a wig to hide his increasing baldness. He does not even dye his grey hair or beard. Despite exposing his “real looks” as opposed to his “reel looks” publicly, the superstar continues to retain his charismatic hold on his adoring masses.

Rajinikanth has in a career spanning five  decades acted in 172 films. He is currently acting in his 173rd  film .Over  a hundred  of Rajini’s films are in the Tamil language but the dusky demi-god has acted in Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam movies also. Rajinikanth has acted in one English film, ‘Bloodstone’.

Among the noteworthy films Rajinikanth has acted in are Aval Appadithaan,Mullum Malarum, Aarilirunthu Arupathu varai, Sri Raghavaendhar, Nallavanukku Nallavan, Kai Kodukkum Kai,Murattukkaalai,Engayo Kaetta Kural, Moondru Mugam,  Naan Mahaan Alla, Thanga Mahan,Naan Sihappu  Manithan,Thalapathy. Thillumullu, Arunachalam, Muthu, Baashaa, Manithan, Annaamalai, Padayappaa, Chandramukhi, Kabaali, Pettai, Kala,Jailer, Vettaiyan and Coolie.

Some of the reputed  filmmakers who have directed his films are K Balachander, SP Muthuraman, P Vasu, Suresh Krishna, KS Ravikumar,Maniratnam, Shankar, C.Sundar,Pa.Ranjith ,Nelson Dilipkumar and Lokesh Canagaraj.

Prominent among the numerous actresses with whom Rajinikanth has acted with are Sri Devi,Sri Priya, Lakshmi,Radhika, Radha, Ambika, Poornima, Revathy, Gautami, Amala, Meena, Roja,Soundarya, Nayantara, Shreya Saran, Trisha and of course the unforgettable “Neelambari” Ramya Krishnan!

Most of Rajinikanth’s films have been money spinners running to  houseful audiences  for weeks and weeks. He is one of  the highest paid actors in Indian filmdom and is reportedly paid more than  100 crore Indian rupees  and a share of the profits for a film.

Rajinikanth was awarded the “Padma Bhushan” in 2000 and the “Padma Vibhushan”in 2016 by the Indian Government.They are the third and second highest Indian  civilian honours. Rajini also got the highest honour in the Indian cinema sphere -the Dadasaheb Phalke award in 2019. He has also received the IFFI Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement reward. Rajinikanth is also the recipient of a national film award, seven Tamil Nadu state film award, the Telugu cinema’s “Nandhi”award and a “Fimfare”magazine award.

A unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans is the proliferation of fan clubs (Rasikar Mandrangal). These clubs would hold special poojas in temples whenever a new movie of their matinee idol was released. Milk would be poured on cut-outs of actors and camphor lit. The clubs hold annual conventions and also participate in social service projects.

“Superstar” Rajinikanth too has an enormous fan club network. So immense was it that the actor stopped sanctioning and ‘officially’ registering fan clubs since 1996-’97. At that time there were over 50,000 fan clubs with a minimum membership of at least 25 each. Though Rajinikanth stopped sanctioning fan clubs since 1997 that has not deterred his rasikas from continuing to form fan clubs. This has resulted in thousands of ‘unofficial’ Rajinikanth fan clubs with millions of members being formed  in the past years.

There was a time when Rajinikanth  began flirting with the idea of forming a political party and vying for the position of Tamil Nadu  chief minister. He even made a public announcement to that effect..Rajinikanth’s first task after announcing his political entry was the formal regularisation of his  fan clubs both official and unofficial into one entity called ‘Rajini Makkal Mandram’ (Rajini Peoples Forum).

Rajinikanth streamlining  his fan clubs into a single co-ordinated entity indicated that the superstar was emulating former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MG Ramachandran (MGR) who transformed his fan clubs into party branches when he started his own political party the AIADMK in 1972.

It appeared that Rajinikanth was setting his sight on the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly elections.  There was speculation that Rajinikanth  would combat the dominant Dravidian ideology with his own brand of “Aanmeeha Arasiyal”or spiritual politics. But that did not happen.

Rajini had earlier undergone a kidney transplant.His daughter Aishwarya was the donor. When the COVID pandemic hit the world in 2020, India was hugely impacted. Rajinikanth was warned by doctors that plunging into active  politics could pose a fatal health hazard. Rajinikanth pressured strongly by family members and genuine well-wishers abandoned the idea of entering politics. He said it was a message from God.

Rajinikanth is a devout Hindu and a follower of the philosophy propounded by the miracle-working scholarly Saint Shree Ragavendhra Swami. Not only has Rajini named the wedding hall he owns in Chennai as ‘Ragavendhra Kalyana Mandapam,’ but has also acted as the holy man in his 100th film ‘Sri Ragavendhrar’ released in 1985.

Moreover, Rajinikanth has a custom of withdrawing frequently to the Himalayas and engaging in meditation. He is also a devotee of Shree Sabarimalai Aiyappan hill temple in Kerala. Rajinikanth has never hesitated to speak publicly about his religious and spiritual beliefs. He has also been supportive of the Modi Government at times. This in turn has created an impression – unfairly perhaps – that Rajinikanth is a kindred soul of the ultra-Hindu rightist ‘Hindutva’ school of thought.

Let me conclude this article on a personal note. I have met Rajinikanth only once. This was in 1994. I was editing my own Tamil Weekly in Toronto at that time. Rajinikanth along with his wife Latha had embarked on a tour of Western cities having a substantial Tamil population with a troupe of artistes, singers,musicians and dancers.

Due to some issues with the organizers, activist supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched a campaign urging a boycott of the Rajinikanth show. The performances were poorly attended in Europe and were miserable flops. In Canada some of the organizers who were also tiger supporters tried hard to make it a success.

A press conference was held in Toronto with Rajinikanth. I was also present. It was the first and only time I met Rajinikanth in person. He answered  questions including those of mine openly and boldly. After the conference Rajini and I had a one on one conversation for about fifteen minutes.

Subsequently I wrote an extensive article in my weekly “Muncharie”about the Rajinikanth tour.I was critical of LTTE supporters for organizing the boycott. I was surprised when Rajinikanth telephoned and   thanked me. We spoke on the telephone for quite a while. I later learnt that Rajini had read my article  and appreciated it saying “Ennamaa Ezhudhiyirukkiraar”(how well he has written). I also wrote an article in English about the Rajinikanth show fiasco for “The Sunday Leader”in Colombo.

Rajinikanth’s conduct at the media meet and his conversations with me made a very good impression. He came off as a simple,humble man without airs or pretences. He spoke frankly and forthrightly without mincing his words. He was a “real”person exuding an aura of honesty and simplicity. I liked Rajinikanth the man very much then.
