    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Flames erupted last Tuesday amid the burned wreckage of the battery storage facility at Moss Landing Power Plant. It happened after a major fire there burned for days and then went quiet for weeks.  The reignition is yet another reminder of how difficult fires in lithium-ion batteries can be to deal with. They burn hotter than other fires\u2014and even when it looks as if the danger has passed, they can reignite. As these batteries become more prevalent, first responders are learning a whole new playbook for what to do when they catch fire, as a new story from our latest print magazine points out. Let\u2019s talk about what makes battery fires a new challenge, and what it means for the devices, vehicles, and grid storage facilities that rely on them.",
    "\u201cFires in batteries are pretty nasty,\u201d says Nadim Maluf, CEO and cofounder of Qnovo, a company that develops battery management systems and analytics. While first responders might be able to quickly douse a fire in a gas-powered vehicle with a hose, fighting an EV fire can require much more water. Often, it\u2019s better to just let battery fires burn out on their own, as Maya Kapoor outlines in her story for MIT Technology Review. And as one expert pointed out in that story, until a battery is dismantled and recycled, \u201cit\u2019s always going to be a hazard.\u201d",
    "One very clear example of that is last week\u2019s reignition at Moss Landing, the world\u2019s biggest battery storage project. In mid-January, a battery fire destroyed a significant part of a 300-megawatt grid storage array.\u00a0 The site has been quiet for weeks, but residents in the area got an alert last Tuesday night urging them to stay indoors and close windows. Vistra, the owner of Moss Landing Power Plant, didn\u2019t respond to written questions for this story but said in a public statement that flames were spotted at the facility on Tuesday and the fire had burned itself out by Wednesday morning. Even after a battery burns, some of the cells can still hold charge, Maluf says, and in a large storage installation on the grid, there can be a whole lot of stored energy that can spark new blazes or pose a danger to cleanup crews long after the initial fire. Vistra is currently in the process of de-linking batteries at Moss Landing, according to a website the company set up to share information about the fire and aftermath. The process involves unhooking the electrical connections between batteries, which reduces the risk of future problems. De-linking work began on February 22 and should take a couple of weeks to complete.  Even as crews work to limit future danger from the site, we still don\u2019t know why a fire started at Moss Landing in the first place. Vistra\u2019s site says an investigation is underway and that it\u2019s working with local officials to learn more. Battery fires can start when cells get waterlogged or punctured, but they can also spark during normal use, if a small manufacturing defect goes unnoticed and develops into a problem.\u00a0 Remember when Samsung Galaxy Note phones were banned from planes because they kept bursting into flames? That was the result of a manufacturing defect that could lead to short-circuiting in some scenarios. (A short-circuit basically happens when the two separate electrodes of a battery come into contact, allowing an uncontrolled flow of electricity that can release heat and start fires.) And then there\u2019s the infamous Chevy Bolt\u2014those vehicles were all recalled because of fire risk. The issues were also traced back to a manufacturing issue that caused cells to short-circuit.",
    "One piece of battery safety is designing EV packs and large stationary storage arrays so that fires can be slowed down and isolated when they do occur. There have been major improvements in fire suppression measures in recent years, and first responders are starting to better understand how to deal with battery fires that get out of hand.\u00a0 Ultimately, though, preventing fires before they occur is the goal. It\u2019s a hard job. Identifying manufacturing defects can be like searching for a needle in a haystack, Maluf says. Battery chemistry and cell design are complicated, and the tiniest problem can lead to a major issue down the road.\u00a0 But fire prevention is important to gain public trust, and investing in safety improvements is worth it, because we need these devices more than ever. Batteries are going to be crucial in efforts to clean up our power grid and the transportation sector. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the answer is stopping these projects,\u201d Maluf says. \u201cThat train has left the station.\u201d   Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading For more on the Moss Landing Power Plant fire, catch up with my newsletter from a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 Batteries are a \u201cmaster key\u201d technology, meaning they can unlock other tech that helps cut emissions, according to a 2024 report from the International Energy Agency.
