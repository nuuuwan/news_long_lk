“I hope you will carry this child even more safely than I did,” Ranil said, expressing hope that the new president would resolve the country’s remaining challenges

Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Executive Committee member of the National People’s Power, appeared on a TV talk show last Tuesday, where he expressed appreciation for former President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s efforts in leaving the Treasury in a stable financial condition. Abeysinghe noted that Wickremesinghe’s prudent fiscal management ensured that the incoming administration, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, would have adequate financial resources to maintain government operations without facing immediate economic difficulties. He emphasised that such a gesture demonstrated Wickremesinghe’s sense of responsibility toward the country’s well-being, regardless of his political standing.

In addition to the stable state of the Treasury, officials from the Ministry of Power and Energy also informed President Dissanayake that Sri Lanka currently has sufficient fuel reserves to meet the nation’s consumption needs. This assurance further highlighted the careful planning during Wickremesinghe’s administration, which left the incoming government with a manageable energy situation, a critical factor considering the ongoing global fuel crises. These developments provided the new administration with a stronger platform to build on as they work towards addressing the remaining challenges facing the country.

Another critical issue is the recovery of assets allegedly stolen by the Rajapaksas. According to the same NPP spokesman, the files in their possession indicate that these assets are valued at $10 billion—(three times the amount of the IMF loan the country is currently struggling to secure). As promised, addressing this matter should be a top priority for the new administration.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, who lost the presidential election, delivered an emotional farewell after serving 26 months as Sri Lanka’s president.

Grusha, Michael and Rope Bridge

Wickremesinghe often referenced Bertolt Brecht’s The Caucasian Chalk Circle’s  servant-girl Grusha’s role during his presidency, using the metaphor of “somebody else’s child” to describe the difficult task of leading Sri Lanka. Just as in Brecht’s play, where a child is entrusted to the one most capable of caring for it, Wickremesinghe saw himself as a caretaker during a critical period, even though the country was “NOT HIS BABY” politically. This allegory highlighted the selfless duty he felt in navigating the nation through its economic crisis, even as he prepared to hand over leadership. Azdak, with profound wisdom, declared Grusha to be Michael’s true mother—not through blood, but through love and sacrifice. He understood that it was devotion, not biology, that qualified her to raise the child, and he gently urged her to take him into her care.

Yet, our own “Azdaks” seem to have different intentions. They seek validation elsewhere, prioritising power over compassion. Our modern Azdaks appear more focused on the “change” they anticipated, that is vital for a brighter future.

“I hope you will carry this child even more safely than I did,” Ranil said, expressing hope that the new president would resolve the country’s remaining challenges. Despite finishing third in the election with only 17% of the vote, Wickremesinghe promised his continued service to Sri Lanka, whether in power or not.

He acknowledged that the IMF-backed austerity measures, though unpopular, were necessary to stabilise the economy. He pointed to the rise in Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves from USD 20 million to USD 5.7 billion as one of his administration’s key accomplishments.

The election results suggest that minorities have limited confidence in the new president’s ability to address their concerns

SJB and Vote Counting Drama

The SJB’s missteps continued as two outsiders, who had only joined the alliance at the final moments, accompanied the party’s secretary in leading a delegation to the Election Commission on Sunday evening. This occurred just as the Commission had successfully concluded the vote-counting process and was preparing to announce the winner. The delegation complained that the counting process, particularly the tally of preference votes, was flawed and insisted that the results could not be accepted. In an attempt to stir public opinion, they also held a media conference to amplify their grievances, despite the commission’s completion of a transparent and orderly election process.

Such unnecessary acts will hamper emerging new political culture of collaboration and respect between opposing parties. For too long, the political landscape has been dominated by animosity and hostility between rival parties, hindering progress and creating divisions that stymied national growth. However, recent shifts in attitude—where parties are willing to focus more on constructive dialogue, policy-based debates, and mutual respect—signal a promising future for the country.

A shift away from the traditional adversarial politics and towards a more cooperative approach could pave the way for more stable governance, where ideas are exchanged for the betterment of the people rather than for party gains. When political parties prioritise national interest over personal or party agendas, the entire nation benefits. A government that welcomes input from Opposition parties is likely to be more balanced and inclusive, leading to policies that address a broader range of issues and represent a wider demographic.

The then NPP leader, now the President, appealed to the North/East electorate to join forces with voters in the south to push for systemic change. However, they did not heed this call, as reflected clearly in their voting patterns. The election results suggest that minorities has limited confidence in the new president’s ability to address their concerns. Now, the president and his administration must face the tough realities ahead and demonstrate that socialism is viable in practice.

If Sri Lanka continues to foster this new political culture, where opposing parties collaborate to address the country’s most pressing challenges, the bright future that everyone envisages could soon become a reality. Such a transformation could bring about the stability, progress, and unity that have long eluded the nation, marking a turning point in Sri Lankan politics and ushering in an era of sustainable development, peace, and prosperity.

Controversial High-profile Appointments

President has stirred a controversy with two appointments in his administration. The appointment of   President’s Secretary, has raised eyebrows due to the selection of a relatively junior figure within the administrative hierarchy, bypassing more experienced candidates. The second, even more contentious, is the appointment of a former police officer as Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order. This individual still faces unresolved legal allegations casting a shadow over his suitability.  These decisions may lead the public to perceive these actions as unfavorable, echoing the practices of previous regimes, which were often criticised for prioritising loyalty or convenience over merit and integrity. This perception could undermine the president’s promise of change and reform.

With a focus on collective problem-solving, Sri Lanka could build a stronger economy, improve its social services, and address longstanding issues such as ethnic reconciliation, all within a framework of good governance. The key to this vision is the continuation of this new attitude—where political opponents are viewed as contributors to a shared national project, not as enemies to be defeated at all costs. If maintained, this attitude will allow the country to progress faster and more efficiently, achieving the change and future that so many have long desired.
