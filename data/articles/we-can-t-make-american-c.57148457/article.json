    "Note for readers: This newsletter discusses gun violence, a raw and tragic issue in America. It was already in progress on Wednesday when a school shooting occurred at Evergreen High School in Colorado and Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the Trump administration\u2019s Make America Healthy Again movement released a strategy for improving the health and well-being of American children. The report was titled\u2014you guessed it\u2014Make Our Children Healthy Again.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, and his colleagues are focusing on four key aspects of child health: diet, exercise, chemical exposure, and overmedicalization. Anyone who\u2019s been listening to RFK Jr. posturing on health and wellness won\u2019t be surprised by these priorities. And the first two are pretty obvious. On the whole, American children should be eating more healthily. And they should be getting more exercise.",
    "But there\u2019s a glaring omission. The leading cause of death for American children and teenagers isn\u2019t ultraprocessed food or exposure to some chemical. It\u2019s gun violence.\u00a0 Yesterday\u2019s news of yet more high-profile shootings at schools in the US throws this disconnect into even sharper relief. Experts believe it is time to treat gun violence in the US as what it is: a public health crisis.",
    "Related StoryPodcast: Can AI keep guns out of schools? I live in London, UK, with my husband and two young children. We don\u2019t live in a particularly fancy part of the city\u2014in one recent ranking of London boroughs from most to least posh, ours came in at 30th out of 33. I do worry about crime. But I don\u2019t worry about gun violence. That changed when I temporarily moved my family to the US a couple of years ago. We rented the ground-floor apartment of a lovely home in Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2014a beautiful area with good schools, pastel-colored houses, and fluffy rabbits hopping about. It wasn\u2019t until after we\u2019d moved in that my landlord told me he had guns in the basement. My daughter joined the kindergarten of a local school that specialized in music, and we took her younger sister along to watch the kids sing songs about friendship. It was all so heartwarming\u2014until we noticed the school security officer at the entrance carrying a gun. Later in the year, I received an email alert from the superintendent of the Cambridge Public Schools. \u201cAt approximately 1:45 this afternoon, a Cambridge Police Department Youth Officer assigned to Cambridge Rindge and Latin School accidentally discharged their firearm while using a staff bathroom inside the school,\u201d the message began. \u201cThe school day was not disrupted.\u201d  These experiences, among others, truly brought home to me the cultural differences over firearms between the US and the UK (along with most other countries). For the first time, I worried about my children\u2019s exposure to them. I banned my children from accessing parts of the house. I felt guilty that my four-year-old had to learn what to do if a gunman entered her school.\u00a0 But it\u2019s the statistics that are the most upsetting. In 2023, 46,728 people died from gun violence in the US, according to a report published in June by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That includes both homicides and suicides, and it breaks down to 128 deaths per day, on average. The majority of those who die from gun violence are adults. But the figures for children are sickening, too. In 2023, 2,566 young people died from gun violence. Of those, 234 were under the age of 10. Gun death rates among children have more than doubled since 2013. Firearms are involved in more child deaths than cancer or car crashes.",
    "Many other children survive gun violence with nonfatal\u2014but often life-changing\u2014injuries. And the impacts are felt beyond those who are physically injured. Witnessing gun violence or hearing gunshots can understandably cause fear, sadness, and distress.\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryShould social media come with a health warning?Yes, use of these platforms can sometimes harm. But it's not all bad.",
    "That\u2019s worth bearing in mind when you consider that there have been 434 school shootings in the US since Columbine in 1999. The Washington Post estimates that 397,000 students have experienced gun violence at school in that period. Another school shooting took place at Evergreen High School in Colorado on Wednesday, adding to that total. \u201cBeing indirectly exposed to gun violence takes its toll on our mental health and children\u2019s ability to learn,\u201d says Daniel Webster, Bloomberg Professor of American Health at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore. The MAHA report states that \u201cAmerican youth face a mental health crisis,\u201d going on to note that \u201csuicide deaths among 10- to 24-year-olds increased by 62% from 2007 to 2021\u201d and that \u201csuicide is now the leading cause of death in teens aged 15-19.\u201d What it doesn\u2019t say is that around half of these suicides involve guns. \u201cWhen you add all these dimensions, [gun violence is] a very huge public health problem,\u201d says Webster. Researchers who study gun violence have been saying the same thing for years. And in 2024, then US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared it a public health crisis. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to subject our children to the ongoing horror of firearm violence in America,\u201d Murthy said in a statement at the time. Instead, he argued, we should tackle the problem using a public health approach. Part of that approach involves identifying who is at the greatest risk and offering support to lower that risk, says Webster. Young men who live in poor communities tend to have the highest risk of gun violence, he says, as do those who experience crisis or turmoil. Trying to mediate conflicts or limit access to firearms, even temporarily, can help lower the incidence of gun violence, he says. There\u2019s an element of social contagion, too, adds Webster. Shooting begets more shooting. He likens it to the outbreak of an infectious disease. \u201cWhen more people get vaccinated \u2026 infection rates go down,\u201d he says. \u201cAlmost exactly the same thing happens with gun violence.\u201d",
    "But existing efforts are already under threat. The Trump administration has eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for organizations working to reduce gun violence. Webster thinks the MAHA report has \u201cmissed the mark\u201d when it comes to the health and well-being of children in the US. \u201cThis document is almost the polar opposite to how many people in public health think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that injuries and deaths from firearms are a big threat to the health and safety of children and adolescents.\u201d This article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.
