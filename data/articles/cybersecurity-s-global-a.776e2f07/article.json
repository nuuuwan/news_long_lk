    "Every day, billions of people trust digital systems to run everything from communication to commerce to critical infrastructure. But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage\u2014and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable. Over the past 18 months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have flirted with apparent collapse. In February 2024, the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)\u2014relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats\u2014abruptly stopped publishing new entries, citing a cryptic \u201cchange in interagency support.\u201d Then, in April of this year, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the fundamental numbering system for tracking software flaws, seemed at similar risk: A leaked letter warned of an imminent contract expiration.  Cybersecurity practitioners have since flooded Discord channels and LinkedIn feeds with emergency posts and memes of \u201cNVD\u201d and \u201cCVE\u201d engraved on tombstones. Unpatched vulnerabilities are the second most common way cyberattackers break in, and they have led to fatal hospital outages and critical infrastructure failures. In a social media post, Jen Easterly, a US cybersecurity expert, said: \u201cLosing [CVE] would be like tearing out the card catalog from every library at once\u2014leaving defenders to sort through chaos while attackers take full advantage.\u201d If CVEs identify each vulnerability like a book in a card catalogue, NVD entries provide the detailed review with context around severity, scope, and exploitability.\u00a0 In the end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding for CVE another year, attributing the incident to a \u201ccontract administration issue.\u201d But the NVD\u2019s story has proved more complicated. Its parent organization, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reportedly saw its budget cut roughly 12% in 2024, right around the time that CISA pulled its $3.7 million in annual funding for the NVD. Shortly after, as the backlog grew, CISA launched its own \u201cVulnrichment\u201d program to help address the analysis gap, while promoting a more distributed approach that allows multiple authorized partners to publish enriched data.",
    "\u201cCISA continuously assesses how to most effectively allocate limited resources to help organizations reduce the risk of newly disclosed vulnerabilities,\u201d says Sandy Radesky, the agency\u2019s associate director for vulnerability management. Rather than just filling the gap, she emphasizes, Vulnrichment was established to provide unique additional information, like recommended actions for specific stakeholders, and to \u201creduce dependency of the federal government\u2019s role to be the sole provider of vulnerability enrichment.\u201d Meanwhile, NIST has scrambled to hire contractors to help clear the backlog. Despite a return to pre-crisis processing levels, a boom in vulnerabilities newly disclosed to the NVD has outpaced these efforts. Currently, over 25,000 vulnerabilities await processing\u2014nearly 10 times the previous high in 2017, according to data from the software company Anchore. Before that, the NVD largely kept pace with CVE publications, maintaining a minimal backlog.",
    "\u201cThings have been disruptive, and we\u2019ve been going through times of change across the board,\u201d Matthew Scholl, then chief of the computer security division in NIST\u2019s Information Technology Laboratory, said at an industry event in April. \u201cLeadership has assured me and everyone that NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST, both in resourcing and capabilities.\u201d Scholl left NIST in May after 20 years at the agency, and NIST declined to comment on the backlog.\u00a0 The situation has now prompted multiple government actions, with the Department of Commerce launching an audit of the NVD in May and House Democrats calling for a broader probe of both programs in June. But the damage to trust is already transforming geopolitics and supply chains as security teams prepare for a new era of cyber risk. \u201cIt\u2019s left a bad taste, and people are realizing they can\u2019t rely on this,\u201d says Rose Gupta, who builds and runs enterprise vulnerability management programs. \u201cEven if they get everything together tomorrow with a bigger budget, I don\u2019t know that this won\u2019t happen again. So I have to make sure I have other controls in place.\u201d As these public resources falter, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time. Security haves and have-nots What began as a trickle of software vulnerabilities in the early Internet era has become an unstoppable avalanche, and the free databases that have tracked them for decades have struggled to keep up. In early July, the CVE database crossed over 300,000 catalogued vulnerabilities. Numbers jump unpredictably each year, sometimes by 10% or much more. Even before its latest crisis, the NVD was notorious for delayed publication of new vulnerability analyses, often trailing private security software and vendor advisories by weeks or months.  Gupta has watched organizations increasingly adopt commercial vulnerability management (VM) software that includes its own threat intelligence services. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely become over-reliant on our VM tools,\u201d she says, describing security teams\u2019 growing dependence on vendors like Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable to supplement or replace unreliable public databases. These platforms combine their own research with various data sources to create proprietary risk scores that help teams prioritize fixes. But not all organizations can afford to fill the NVD\u2019s gap with premium security tools. \u201cSmaller companies and startups, already at a disadvantage, are going to be more at risk,\u201d she explains.\u00a0 Komal Rawat, a security engineer in New Delhi whose mid-stage cloud startup has a limited budget, describes the impact in stark terms: \u201cIf NVD goes, there will be a crisis in the market. Other databases are not that popular, and to the extent they are adopted, they are not free. If you don\u2019t have recent data, you\u2019re exposed to attackers who do.\u201d Related StoryCyberattacks by AI agents are comingAgents could make it easier and cheaper for criminals to hack systems at scale. We need to be ready.",
    "The growing backlog means new devices could be more likely to have vulnerability blind spots\u2014whether that\u2019s a Ring doorbell at home or an office building\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d access control system. The biggest risk may be \u201cone-off\u201d security flaws that fly under the radar. \u201cThere are thousands of vulnerabilities that will not affect the majority of enterprises,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cThose are the ones that we\u2019re not getting analysis on, which would leave us at risk.\u201d NIST acknowledges it has limited visibility into which organizations are most affected by the backlog. \u201cWe don\u2019t track which industries use which products and therefore cannot measure impact to specific industries,\u201d a spokesperson says. Instead, the team prioritizes vulnerabilities on the basis of CISA\u2019s known exploits list and those included in vendor advisories like Microsoft Patch Tuesday.",
    "The biggest vulnerability Brian Martin has watched this system evolve\u2014and deteriorate\u2014from the inside. A former CVE board member and an original project leader behind the Open Source Vulnerability Database, he has built a combative reputation over the decades as a leading historian and practitioner. Martin says his current project, VulnDB (part of Flashpoint Security), outperforms the official databases he once helped oversee. \u201cOur team processes more vulnerabilities, at a much faster turnaround, and we do it for a fraction of the cost,\" he says, referring to the tens of millions in government contracts that support the current system.\u00a0 When we spoke in May, Martin said his database contains more than 112,000 vulnerabilities with no CVE identifiers\u2014security flaws that exist in the wild but remain invisible to organizations that rely solely on public channels. \u201cIf you gave me the money to triple my team, that non-CVE number would be in the 500,000 range,\u201d he said.

    "In the US, official vulnerability management duties are split between a web of contractors, agencies, and nonprofit centers like the Mitre Corporation. Critics like Martin say that creates potential for redundancy, confusion, and inefficiency, with layers of middle management and relatively few actual vulnerability experts. Others defend the value of this fragmentation. \u201cThese programs build on or complement each other to create a more comprehensive, supportive, and diverse community,\u201d CISA said in a statement. \u201cThat increases the resilience and usefulness of the entire ecosystem.\u201d As American leadership wavers, other nations are stepping up. China now operates multiple vulnerability databases, some surprisingly robust but tainted by the possibility that they are subject to state control. In May, the European Union accelerated the launch of its own database, as well as a decentralized \u201cGlobal CVE\u201d architecture. Following social media and cloud services, vulnerability intelligence has become another front in the contest for technological independence.\u00a0  That leaves security professionals to navigate multiple potentially conflicting sources of data. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mess, but I would rather have too much information than none at all,\u201d says Gupta, describing how her team monitors multiple databases despite the added complexity.\u00a0 Resetting software liability As defenders adapt to the fragmenting landscape, the tech industry faces another reckoning: Why don\u2019t software vendors carry more responsibility for protecting their customers from security issues? Major vendors routinely disclose\u2014but don\u2019t necessarily patch\u2014thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse.\u00a0 For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. \u201cShrink-wrap licenses\u201d once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects. Today\u2019s end-user license agreements (EULAs), often delivered in pop-up browser windows, have evolved into incomprehensibly long documents. Last November, a lab project called \u201cEULAS of Despair\u201d used the length of War and Peace (587,287 words) to measure these sprawling contracts. The worst offender? Twitter, at 15.83 novels\u2019 worth of fine print. \u201cThis is a legal fiction that we\u2019ve created around this whole ecosystem, and it\u2019s just not sustainable,\u201d says Andrea Matwyshyn, a US special advisor and technology law professor at Penn State University, where she directs the Policy Innovation Lab of Tomorrow. \u201cSome people point to the fact that software can contain a mix of products and services, creating more complex facts. But just like in engineering or financial litigation, even the most messy scenarios can be resolved with the assistance of experts.\u201d",

    "This liability shield around software failures\u2014whether from security vulnerabilities or other defects that jeopardize public\u00a0safety\u2014is finally beginning to crack. As an example, Matwyshyn points to the July 2024 CrowdStrike event, when an update to the company's popular endpoint detection software triggered the crash of millions of Windows computers worldwide and caused outages at everything from airlines to hospitals to 911 systems. The incident led to billions in estimated damages, and the city of Portland, Oregon, even declared a \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d Now, affected companies like Delta Airlines have hired high-priced attorneys to pursue major damages\u2014a signal opening of the floodgates to litigation. Despite the soaring number of vulnerabilities, many fall into long-established categories, such as SQL injections that interfere with database queries and buffer memory overflows that enable code to be executed remotely. Matwyshyn advocates for a mandatory \u201csoftware bill of materials,\u201d or S-BOM\u2014an ingredients list that would let organizations understand what components and potential vulnerabilities exist throughout their software supply chains. One recent report found 30% of data breaches stemmed from the vulnerabilities of third-party software vendors or cloud service providers.",
    "She adds: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t tell the difference between the companies that are cutting corners and a company that has really invested in doing right by their customers, that results in a market where everyone loses.\u201d CISA leadership shares this sentiment, with a spokesperson emphasizing its \u201csecure-by-design principles,\u201d such as \u201cmaking essential security features available without additional cost, eliminating classes of vulnerabilities, and building products in a way that reduces the cybersecurity burden on customers.\u201d  Avoiding a digital \u2018dark age\u2019 It will likely come as no surprise that practitioners are looking to AI to help fill the gap, while at the same time preparing for a coming swarm of cyberattacks by AI agents. Security researchers have used an OpenAI model to discover new \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities. And both the NVD and CVE teams are developing \u201cAI-powered tools\u201d to help streamline data collection, identification, and processing. NIST says that \u201cup to 65% of our analysis time has been spent generating CPEs\u201d\u2014product information codes that pinpoint affected software. If AI can solve even part of this tedious process, it could dramatically speed up the analysis pipeline. But Martin cautions against optimism around AI, noting that the technology remains unproven and often riddled with inaccuracies\u2014which, in security, can be fatal. \u201cRather than AI or ML [machine learning], there are ways to strategically automate bits of the processing of that vulnerability data while ensuring 99.5% accuracy,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Related StoryHow to fix the internetIf we want online discourse to improve, we need to move beyond the big platforms.",
    "AI also fails to address more fundamental challenges in governance. The CVE Foundation, launched in April 2025 by breakaway board members, proposes a globally funded nonprofit model similar to that of the internet\u2019s addressing system, which transitioned from US government control to international governance. Other security leaders are pushing to revitalize open-source alternatives like Google\u2019s OSV Project or the NVD++ (maintained by VulnCheck), which are accessible to the public but currently have limited resources. As these various reform efforts gain momentum, the world is waking up to the fact that vulnerability intelligence\u2014like disease surveillance or aviation safety\u2014requires sustained cooperation and public investment. Without it, a patchwork of paid databases will be all that remains, threatening to leave all but the richest organizations and nations permanently exposed.",
