    "Former JVP Leader Somawansa Amerasinghe in conversation with JVP members Tilvin Silva and Anura Kumara Dissanayake. (File Photo)",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was a short lived cabinet minister in 2004-05 is now the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka",
    "When the P-TOMS agreement came into being the JVP demanded that the Kumaratunga Government abandon the project and set the\u00a0 deadline\u00a0 of June 15th 2005 to do so",
    "The JVP performed very creditably in the 2004 election. The party fielded three candidates in each district as part of the UPFA list",
    "As mentioned earlier, Somawansa had returned to Sri Lanka\u00a0 and was engaged in reviving the JVP. Somawansa liked Anura and was impressed by the young man\u2019s intellect, ability and convictions",
    "The JVP worked for Chandrika Kumartunga in the 1994 Presidential elections. After she became President, the JVP ban was lifted",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s newly elected ninth Executive President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) continues to be the focus of this column. In the first part of this article published last week, the early years of\u00a0 Anura\u2019s eventful life were delved into in some detail. In this week\u2019s\u00a0 second part,\u00a0 AKD\u2019s steady rise as a\u00a0 \u00a0political leader within the Janatha\u00a0 Vimukthi\u00a0 Peramuna (JVP) will be related\u00a0to some extent.",
    "As stated in this column last week, the JVP\u2019s second insurgency was ruthlessly suppressed by the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime. Tens of thousands of youths were killed or made to disappear. Thousands of youths were incarcerated for years. Hundreds of youths fled Sri Lanka for safety. Hundreds of youths avoided arrest\u00a0 and possible execution while in Sri Lanka by changing identities and relocating elsewhere.Anura was among those who stayed in Lanka and evaded capture by going underground.",
    "The JVP\u2019s founder leader Rohana Wijeweera, the second leader Saman Piyasiri Fernando and the third leader Lalith Wijerathne were\u00a0 among the top 14 JVP leaders killed by the state in 1989-90. The only senior top leader\u00a0 and Politburo member to survive was Somawansa Amerasinghe alias Siri Aiyaa. He became the fourth JVP leader. Somawansa escaped to India in 1990 and from\u00a0 there went to Thailand. He\u00a0 later travelled\u00a0 to\u00a0 Italy\u00a0 and from there sought\u00a0 political\u00a0 asylum in France.",
    "Somawansa Amerasinghe",
    "Somawansa Amerasinghe shuttled between various European countries and set up JVP branches among Sinhala expatriates. He also interacted with\u00a0 dormant cadres in Sri Lanka and began a clandestine process of reviving the near extinct JVP. Tiny cells of 5 to 10 members were set up. Somawansa was in contact with these cells from France and the UK and coordinated activities. Meanwhile the security situation began easing. Detained cadres were gradually released but the JVP proscription remained in force.",
    "After Premdasa\u2019s death in May 1993, the political climate changed for the better as far as the JVP was concerned. Somawansa Amerasinghe returned to Sri Lanka in 1994 and began re-organising the JVP quietly.\u00a0 When Parliamentary elections were announced, the JVP\u00a0 was still a proscribed party. So Somawansa formed a front entity called\u00a0 \u00a0Sri Lanka Progressive Front (SLPF)\u00a0 and contested only in the Hambantota district. The SLPF (JVP) got 15,309 votes. Janith Vipulaguna was elected MP. But he resigned soon and Nihal Galappaththi became H\u2019tota MP.",
    "The JVP worked for Chandrika Kumartunga in the 1994 Presidential elections. After she became President, the JVP ban was lifted. The JVP resumed its political work openly again. The JVP under Somawansa Amerasinghe\u2019s leadership held its national convention in Tangalle in 1995.",
    "Meanwhile\u00a0 Anura had resumed his tertiary studies again. He became an undergraduate at the Kelaniya University in 1992. AKD adopted a low profile during his undergraduate days but participated in student union activity. He also conducted classes at a tutorial institution.",
    "Anura was also in contact with Somawansa and used to convey confidential messages from him to other JVP members.\u00a0 AKD completed his studies and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree\u00a0 (BSc) in Physical Science in 1995.Instead of seeking full time employment AKD turned to full time politics.",
    "As mentioned earlier, Somawansa had returned to Sri Lanka\u00a0 and was engaged in reviving the JVP. Somawansa liked Anura and was impressed by the young man\u2019s intellect, ability and convictions. He took Anura under his wing.",
    "The JVP backed Socialist Students Association\u00a0 \u00a0was re-organised in 1995 after the national convention at Tangalle. AKD was appointed\u00a0 National Organiser. Thereafter his rise was rapid within JVP ranks. In 1996 he became a member of the JVP central\u00a0 committee. AKD was elevated to the all-powerful JVP Politburo (Political Bureau) in 1998.",
    "The first JVP insurgency of 1971\u00a0 was aiming for a socialist revolution. The\u00a0 JVP second insurgency of 1987-90\u00a0 objective was\u00a0 patriotic resistance to an \u201cIndian Invasion\u201d. Now the JVP was in its third phase. It was a bruised and battered JVP.",
    "Even though people were sad and horrified about the massacre of thousands of youths by the state, they were also terrified about the atrocities committed by the JVP. The reign of JVP terror was still fresh in memory. The JVP therefore required a new platform to launch its resurgence.",
    "The Sri Lankan forces were at war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The JVP led by Somawansa adopted a Sinhala\u00a0 chauvinist line under the guise of Sri Lankan patriotism and anti-separatism. The JVP backed the war and fully supported the war effort in many ways. They engaged in promotional campaigns to recruit more personnel for the armed forces. The JVP\u00a0 also visited the frontlines with the assignment of boosting the morale of soldiers.",
    "Even as the JVP was re-inventing itself in a bid\u00a0 to transform its negative\u00a0 anti-state image into\u00a0 a positive pro-state image, the party commenced contesting in\u00a0 elections regularly. Even though the JVP was against the Indo-Lanka accord and the 13th Amendment, the party was not averse to contesting Provincial council elections.",
    "The JVP also contested Municipal councils, urban councils and divisional councils (pradeshiya sabhas). By contesting electoral bodies, the JVP broadened its support base. Party stalwarts gained recognition by becoming elected members.",
    "Parliamentary Elections",
    "The prize sought after most was of course Parliament. The JVP contested the Parliamentary elections of 2000 and polled\u00a0 518,774 votes. The JVP got 10 MPs (8 elected and 2 appointed).The JVP\u00a0 again contested the 2001 poll and garnered 815,353 votes. The JVP got 16 MPs of whom 13 were elected and 3 were appointed on the National List.",
    "As stated earlier Anura was by now a key member of the JVP. He was the national organiser of the Socialist\u00a0 Students Association, central committee member and member of the politburo. AKD was rather influential as the student union organiser. The students were the mainstay of the JVP when it organised demonstrations. Under Anura\u2019s direction, the pro-JVP students union had expanded considerably and established itself in most universities and institutions of higher studies.",
    "So when the JVP contested polls, AKD was placed on the National List so that he could engage in propaganda all over instead of being tied down to the district as a candidate. He had blossomed into an able speaker but\u00a0 did not indulge in fanciful rhetoric. AKD\u00a0 was a direct, straight to the point kind of speaker who appealed to reason. Sometimes he was emotional too.",
    "Thus in 2000 AKD\u00a0 was appointed as national list MP and entered Parliament for the first time. In 2001 Anura was re-appointed as National List MP for the second time. Soon AKD made his mark as a\u00a0 powerful\u00a0 orator and\u00a0 skilful debater in Parliament.",
    "Although Chandrika Kumaratunga was the president in 2001, her party the People\u2019s Alliance (PA)\u00a0 came off second best in the election. The United National Front (UNF) led by Ranil Wickremesinghe came first with 4,086,026 votes and obtained 109 MPs. The Chandrika Kumaratunga led People\u2019s Alliance (PA) got 3,330,815 votes entitling it to 77 MPs. The JVP with 815,353 votes got 16 MPs. It was obvious that if the PA and JVP votes were combined the UNP led UNF could\u00a0 have been\u00a0 relegated to second place.",
    "It was on this basis that\u00a0 \u00a0former minister Mangala Samaraweera forged an alliance with the JVP for the 2004 elections. The envoy of a concerned country stationed in Colombo also facilitated this axis. Thus the JVP contested as part of the\u00a0 SLFP led United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the 2004 elections. The UPFA polled 4,223,970 votes entitling it to 105 seats. The UNF with 3,504,200 votes got 82 seats.",
    "The JVP performed very creditably in the 2004 election. The party fielded three candidates in each district as part of the UPFA list. JVP cadres worked hard to get the maximum number of preference votes for their candidates. Due to this, the JVP obtained 39 MP seats in the 2004 election.",
    "2004 was a watershed year for Anura Kumara Dissanayake.\u00a0 The April 2004 election was his electoral baptism. AKD contested in the Kurunegala district on the UPF ticket. He was elected with 153,868 preference votes. When President Kumaratunga formed the Cabinet, four portfolios were allocated to the JVP. AKD was appointed as the Cabinet minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation.",
    "AKD was delighted over his portfolio as farming and agriculture was a subject close to his heart. He set about his duties diligently and worked out plans to rejuvenate the country\u2019s agricultural and livestock breeding sectors. Unfortunately matters took a different turn. Anura\u2019s ministerial duties came to an abrupt end. Dissanayake along with other JVP colleagues in the UPFA\u00a0 Government resigned their posts. All 39 MP\u2019s of the JVP quit the Government.",
    "What had happened was this. The country had experienced\u00a0 terrible calamity in December 2004 in the form of\u00a0 Tsunami. Deaths, destruction and displacement occurred on a mammoth scale. Large coastal areas in the regions controlled by the LTTE were also affected by the Tsunami. So too were other coastal areas in the North and the East.",
    "International donors were prepared to allocate 3 billion dollars aid for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Tsunami affected families and areas. A\u00a0 strict condition for aid was that the money had to be spent equitably to help\u00a0 affected Tamil speaking regions also.",
    "President Kumaratunga entered into discussions\u00a0 with the LTTE through Norwegian facilitation. An unconventional joint structure with the LTTE was set up by the Government. This was known as the Post-Tsunami\u00a0 Operational Management Structure (P-TOMS). The P-TOMS was set up to enable equitable distribution of funds procured through foreign assistance to affected Tamil speaking areas under LTTE control. The P-TOMS was a joint Govt-LTTE mechanism.",
    "However, the JVP Led by Somawansa Amarasinghe strongly objected to the P-TOMS. The JVP\u00a0 forgetting its own past\u00a0 described the LTTE as terrorist and condemned the P-TOMS for equating the LTTE on par with the Government.",
    "Incidentally the JVP had opposed the ceasefire and Oslo facilitated talks with the LTTE. When the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe initiated the\u00a0 peace process in 2002, the JVP\u00a0 organised huge protests against the talks with the LTTE.",
    "When the P-TOMS agreement came into being the JVP demanded that the Kumaratunga Government abandon the project and set the\u00a0 deadline\u00a0 of June 15th 2005 to do so. When President Kumaratunga refused, the JVP quit the Government en masse on 16 June 2005.\u00a0 All the four ministers including Dissanayke resigned their posts.",
    "Somawanasa Amerasinghe, the JVP leader said at the press conference, \u201cWe now announce our leaving the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance with a sense of deep regret of work unfulfilled.\u201d",
    "FR Petition Against P-TOMS",
    "Thereafter all 39 MPs of the JVP filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court against the P-TOMS agreement that had been signed between the Government and the LTTE. The JVP parliamentarians including AK Dissanayake cited five\u00a0 reasons in their FR petition\u00a0 for seeking an injunction against the P-TOMS.",
    "A three- judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva heard the petition and issued an interim order\u00a0 restraining the key operational clauses of the agreement for the P-TOMS. With Presidential elections being scheduled for November 2005, the P-TOMS became a non-starter.",
    "The JVP welcomed\u00a0 the injunction\u00a0 saying it had \u201ceffectively stopped\u201d the implementation of the joint mechanism. \u201cThere are no wheels in the bus,\u201d the JVP\u2019s former propaganda secretary, Wimal Weerawansa, gloated.",
    "JVP Supported Mahinda",
    "The JVP Parliamentarians were now in the opposition. However, the JVP supported Mahinda Rajapaksa in the 2005 presidential elections after signing a memorandum of understanding with him. The JVP helped Mahinda win in 2005. 19 years later the JVP has won a\u00a0 presidential election on its own.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was a short lived cabinet minister in 2004-05 is now the ninth executive president of Sri Lanka. The story of Anura\u2019s political ascendancy within the JVP and within the country at large\u00a0 will be narrated in the third part of this article.",
