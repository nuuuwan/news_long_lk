In an article by The Federal, M.R. Narayan Swamy examines the choices of Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) or Tamil Tigers, which led to the demise of the organisation. According to Pottu Amman, the LTTE intelligence chief, the ejection of the Tamil-speaking Muslim community forced to quit Sri Lanka's north, the forcible conscription of young Tamils and the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi were the main reasons for LTTE's military setback. Pottu Amman and Prabhakaran took major decisions, which showcased their lack of long-term vision. Tamils had genuine grievances, and mature negotiation could have potentially settled disputes with Tamil leadership before resorting to violence. Prabhakaran conducted mass massacres and became enveloped with the mindset to control Tamil militancy singlehandedly, even killing Tamil rivals. Swamy concludes in his article that Prabhakaran's decisions weakened both himself and the LTTE, leading to its eventual collapse in 2009.
