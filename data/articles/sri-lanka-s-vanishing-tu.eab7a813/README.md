Sri Lanka’s tusker population is on the brink of collapse, threatening not only the survival of these majestic creatures but also the country’s ecological balance, genetic diversity, and cultural heritage. A recent comparative analysis between Sri Lanka and India highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive conservation program to protect the nation’s dwindling population of tusked elephants.

A dire situation for Sri Lanka’s tuskers

The stark contrast in tusker numbers between India and Sri Lanka underscores the urgency of the crisis. While India had an estimated 1,200 tuskers in 2010, Sri Lanka had only 122 by 2011. More recent data from a 2024 census is still pending, but trends suggest that Sri Lanka’s tusker population may have continued to decline due to poaching, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict.

Even more concerning is the proportion of tuskers among male elephants. In India, tuskers make up approximately 13-20% of the male population, whereas in Sri Lanka, the figure stands at just 7%. This disparity is largely attributed to selective hunting practices in the past, as well as ongoing conservation failures that fail to prioritise tusked elephants.

Adding to this crisis, a line of iconic tuskers has been killed in recent years, including Rewatha, Barana, Deegadanthu-1, and the most recent case of tusker Unicorn (17 March). This alarming trend raises concerns about whether all tuskers will permanently vanish within the next few years.

Additionally, two famous iconic tuskers in Yala National Park have been missing for several months, further exacerbating fears about their survival.

The ecological and genetic importance of tuskers

Beyond their aesthetic and symbolic significance, tuskers play a crucial role in the elephant population’s genetic diversity and social stability. Tuskers are dominant males that contribute significantly to breeding, ensuring that tusked genes are passed down to future generations. If tuskers continue to decline, the proportion of tuskless males—known as ‘makhnas’—will increase, further exacerbating the species’ genetic bottleneck.

Tuskers also play a vital role in elephant society. Young male elephants, known as juveniles, learn essential life skills from older bulls, including how to interact with humans and navigate their environment. Mature tuskers act as role models, helping younger males develop socially acceptable behaviours. Without them, juvenile elephants may become more aggressive and unpredictable, escalating human-elephant conflict across the island.

Tuskers and their role in human-elephant conflict mitigation

A lesser-known but vital function of tuskers is their role in naturally mitigating human-elephant conflict. Unlike younger males, who often form aggressive, crop-raiding bachelor groups, older tuskers maintain order within elephant herds, preventing unruly behaviour. The absence of tuskers in Sri Lanka has likely contributed to the increase in human-elephant conflicts, which claim the lives of around 300 elephants and 100 people annually.

Tourism and economic implications

The Annual Great Elephant Gathering in Minneriya-Kaudulla National Park, classified by Lonely Planet as one of the top 10 wildlife spectacles in the world, is one of the key wildlife attractions in Sri Lanka. It generates significant tourism income from natural resources. Recently killed ‘Unicorn’ was not just an elephant—he was an icon of Sri Lanka’s wilderness, a giant who roamed Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks, captivating thousands who came to witness the Great Elephant Gathering. His absence will be deeply felt, not just by conservationists but by every Sri Lankan who cherishes our rich natural heritage.

Sri Lanka’s wildlife tourism industry thrives on the presence of elephants, with tuskers being the most sought-after attraction for visitors. The country’s elephant-watching sites, including Minneriya, Udawalawe, and Yala National Parks, draw thousands of tourists annually. However, the continued decline of tuskers threatens this economic asset. Unlike India, which still boasts a significant number of tuskers in its wildlife reserves, Sri Lanka risks losing one of its most iconic natural treasures, potentially affecting the country’s tourism revenue and international reputation as a wildlife destination.

A call for immediate action

Sri Lanka should consider GPS collaring of remaining tuskers and implementing a 24x7 monitoring process with technology, complemented by regular physical observation when they move into highly vulnerable human-elephant conflict areas.

Sri Lanka’s conservation policies must be revamped to ensure the survival of its tusker population. Key actions should include:

1. Enhanced anti-poaching measures – Strengthening laws and enforcement against poaching, including increased penalties for targeted killings of tuskers.

2. Genetic conservation programs – Implementing breeding programs and habitat management strategies to increase the number of tuskers in the wild.

3. Protection of key habitats – Expanding protected areas and establishing elephant corridors to reduce human-elephant conflict and safeguard tusker populations.

4. Community engagement – Encouraging local communities to participate in conservation efforts by providing incentives and promoting sustainable coexistence strategies.

5. Stronger Government commitment – Allocating more resources to elephant conservation initiatives and integrating conservation efforts into national environmental policies.

6. Technological monitoring – Deploying GPS tracking and 24x7 surveillance systems to monitor tusker movements, ensuring early intervention when they approach high-risk human-elephant conflict zones. – Allocating more resources to elephant conservation initiatives and integrating conservation efforts into national environmental policies.

The fate of Sri Lanka’s tuskers hangs in the balance. Without immediate and decisive action, these magnificent giants may soon disappear from the wild, leaving behind an irreversible void in the country’s ecosystem, culture, and tourism industry. A comprehensive conservation program is not just a necessity—it is a national duty. Sri Lanka must step up its efforts to ensure that future generations can witness the grandeur of tuskers roaming freely in the wild.
