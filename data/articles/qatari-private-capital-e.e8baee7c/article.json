    "What\u2019s happened?On March 4th a Qatari private equity fund, JTA Investment, agreed with a Vietnamese conglomerate, VinGroup, to invest US$1bn in VinGroup\u2019s electric vehicle\u00a0(EV) subsidiary, VinFast. The move marks Qatar\u2019s entry into the highly competitive EV\u00a0sector. Although other Gulf investors, notably Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (a sovereign wealth vehicle), have acquired stakes in EV\u00a0companies in exchange for local production capacity,\u00a0we do not expect this deal to result in a transfer of production to Qatar, owing to the deal being made by a private capital firm, and also because Qatar is not seeking to establish domestic EV\u00a0manufacturing.Why does it matter?This foray is the most recent move made by Qatari funds to cash in on the global EV boom, as EV sales are expected to rise by 16.3% year on year in 2025 and surpass 19.4m\u00a0units. However, the EV transition will be hampered by the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between China and the US and the EU, which is likely to intensify in 2025, as local content requirements will tighten and other trade barriers will prevent faster market growth, fracturing supply chains and keeping EV prices high.\u00a0JTA\u2019s venture in Vietnamese EV manufacturing emphasises Qatar\u2019s continued commitment and willingness to invest in the EV industry, whose global growth will eventually affect global demand for\u00a0oil.The investment therefore makes strategic sense for private equity funds operating in hydrocarbons-exporting countries such as Qatar, in a bid to hedge against the industry, whose rate of uptake will be one of the major factors influencing oil and gas prices over the next decade. JTA\u00a0Investment and VinGroup are exploring possibilities to extend the partnership to include VinGroup\u2019s hospitality business, which would provide the Qatari company with investment opportunities in luxury hotels, resorts and theme parks operated by VinPearl, another VinGroup subsidiary.\u00a0The fund is likely to tap into an ongoing post-pandemic wave of travel as pent-up demand unleashes and continues to drive forward the tourism and hospitality sectors.What next?This investment underlines that Qatari capital has not lost its appetite for investing in foreign assets, despite a shaky outlook for global trade and investment environments.\u00a0We expect Qatari private and public funds alike to continue investing in the region, as they will benefit from the global shift in supply chains as vehicle and parts makers adopt a \u201cChina\u00a0+1\u201d strategy\u00a0as a result of increasing trade openness and improving human and physical capital in the region.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
