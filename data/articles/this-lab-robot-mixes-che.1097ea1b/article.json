    "Lab scientists spend much of their time doing laborious and repetitive tasks, be it pipetting liquid samples or running the same analyses over and over again. But what if they could simply tell a robot to do the experiments, analyze the data, and generate a report?\u00a0 Enter Organa, a benchtop robotic system devised by researchers at the University of Toronto that can perform chemistry experiments. In a paper posted on the arXiv preprint server, the team reported that the system could automate some chemistry lab tasks using a combination of computer vision and a large language model (LLM) that translates scientists\u2019 verbal cues into an experimental pipeline.\u00a0  Imagine having a robot that can collaborate with a human scientist on a chemistry experiment, says Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik, a chemist, computer scientist, and materials scientist at the University of Toronto, who is one of the project\u2019s leaders. Aspuru-Guzik\u2019s vision is to elevate traditional lab automation to \u201ceventually make an AI scientist,\u201d one that can perform and troubleshoot an experiment and even offer feedback on the results.\u00a0 Aspuru-Guzik and his team designed Organa to be flexible. That means that instead of performing only one task or one part of an experiment as a typical fixed automation system would, it can perform a multistep experiment on cue. The system is also equipped with visualization tools that can monitor progress and provide feedback on how the experiment is going.",
    "\u201cThis is one of the early examples of showing how you can have a bidirectional conversation with an AI assistant for a robotic chemistry lab,\u201d says Milad Abolhasani, a chemical and material engineer at North Carolina State University, who was not involved in the project.\u00a0 Most automated lab equipment is not easily customizable or reprogrammable to suit the chemists\u2019 needs, says Florian Shkurti,\u00a0a computer scientist at the University of Toronto and a co-leader of the project. And even if it is, the chemists would need to have programming skills. But with Organa, scientists can simply convey their experiments through speech. As scientists prompt the robot with their experimental objectives and setup, Organa\u2019s LLM translates this natural-language instruction into \u03c7DL codes, a standard chemical description language. The algorithm breaks down the codes into steps and goals, with a road map to execute each task. If there is an ambiguous instruction or an unexpected outcome, it can flag the issue for the scientist to resolve.",

    "About two-thirds of Organa\u2019s hardware components are made from off-the-shelf parts, making it easier to replicate across laboratories, Aspuru-Guzik says. The robot has a camera detector that can identify both opaque objects and transparent ones, such as a chemical flask. Organa\u2019s first task was to characterize the electrochemical properties of quinones, the electroactive molecules used in rechargeable batteries. The experiment has 19 parallel steps, including routine chemistry steps such as pH and solubility tests, recrystallization, and an electrochemical measurement. It also involves a tedious electrode-precleaning step, which takes up to six hours. \u201cChemists really, really hate this,\u201d says Shkurti. Organa completed the 19-step experiment in about the same amount of time it would take a human\u2014and with comparable results. While the efficiency was not noticeably better than in a manual run, the robot can be much more productive if it is run overnight. \u201cWe always get the advantage of it being able to work 24 hours,\u201d Shkurti says. Abolhasani adds, \u201cThat\u2019s going to save a lot of our highly trained scientists time that they can use to focus on thinking about the scientific problem, not doing these routine tasks in the lab.\u201d\u00a0 Organa\u2019s most sophisticated feature is perhaps its ability to provide feedback on generated data. \u201cWe were surprised to find that this visual language model can spot outliers on chemistry graphs,\u201d explains Shkurti. The system also flags these ambiguities or uncertainties and suggests methods of  troubleshooting.\u00a0 The group is now working on improving the LLM\u2019s ability to plan tasks and then revise those plans to make the system more amenable to experimental uncertainties.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a lot roboticists have to offer to scientists in order to amplify what they can do and get them better data,\u201d Shkurti says. \u201cI am really excited to try to create new possibilities.\u201d\u00a0 Kristel Tjandra is a freelance science writer based in Oahu.\u00a0 hide"
