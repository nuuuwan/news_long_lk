(Text of address to the Nation by President Anura Kumara Disanayake on 30 November 2025)

As a country, we are facing the largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history. We also recognise that what we are undertaking is the most difficult rescue operation in our nation’s history. This is the first time the entire country has been struck by such a disaster.

With the nation affected from end to end, this is a highly challenging task that needs to be conquered. While our small island could be shaken by this merciless natural disaster, the humanity and resilience of our people cannot, in any way, be shaken and this has been reaffirmed again.

The unwavering courage of my beloved citizens gives us absolute confidence that this country can be rebuilt. Dear parents, brothers and sisters, if it were possible to restore life to all those who perished in this disaster, we would fulfil it under any conditions without a second thought. However, we must confront the painful reality. The grief for those lost is eternally with us.

Every life lost is not merely a number; every life carried a name, a face and a story. On behalf of the families of all who have died, we extend our heartfelt sympathy.

Even though this sympathy cannot restore the lives of those families, we are committed to providing them with everything else possible. Likewise, we pray that all those still missing are safe and unharmed. We warmly welcome the hands of everyone who has come forward to comfort those affected and to strengthen those impacted by this calamity.

When natural disasters and emergencies cannot be prevented, it is the government’s responsibility to manage them effectively and to restore the nation to its previous state, or even improve it. We hope to take all possible actions, no matter how challenging, to achieve this. During this crisis, we have repeatedly witnessed that the limited facilities and resources of our country are far less valuable than the extraordinary human capital we possess. We are proud of our citizens’ unwavering confidence, their presence at every moment of need and their readiness to assist.

Looking ahead, we must face the immense task of reconstruction and recovery. The estimated scale of destruction is severe. Yet, the people of our country, resilient after floods, storms, or any calamity, have shown remarkable perseverance.

Our first duty was to save the lives of those caught in the disaster and to provide them with immediate relief. For this, we mobilised the entire state apparatus efficiently. The Armed Forces and Police carried out heroic acts, risking their lives without hesitation. We should be proud of them. As a nation, we should honour them.

From our Ministry Secretaries to Grama Niladharis at the local level, the entire state machinery has been fully engaged in rescuing affected people. This is a human task, executed with wholehearted commitment beyond mere duty. We owe them our deepest gratitude.

Additionally, many volunteers have joined the rescue efforts, even if they themselves were not directly affected, treating the suffering of their neighbours and fellow citizens as their own responsibility. We must remember and acknowledge their contributions.

Our neighbouring and friendly countries have also provided significant assistance. Already, helicopters and relief forces have been deployed, extending a helping hand in solidarity. We are extremely grateful for this support on behalf of our people. A significant portion of the rescue operation has now been completed. The rescued persons are being accommodated in three ways: some within their own homes, some with friends or relatives and some in temporary shelters.

Certain bureaucratic procedures initially obstructed relief distribution to these three groups. We have modified these procedures to ensure government aid reaches all affected without distinction of location. Likewise, prior financial constraints on officials have been eased; for example, Divisional Secretaries may now spend up to Rs. 50 million directly for emergency purposes.

This ensures legal and operational capacity to implement relief efficiently.

From previous budget allocations, approximately Rs. 30 billion is available for immediate expenditure without Parliamentary approval. These funds have been designated specifically for this purpose. District Secretaries have been instructed to provide detailed estimates of required funds and work so that resources can be allocated effectively.

If the allocations earmarked in the 2025 budget are insufficient, we will take action through supplementary estimates and Parliament to secure additional provisions. We are confident that this will allow us to meet the food, health and sanitation needs of the displaced population. Furthermore, the disaster has caused extensive damage to essential services and infrastructure. Electricity has been disrupted in many areas. Water and communication systems have also been damaged and access roads have been broken. A large portion of such infrastructure and services has been destroyed. We have already organised operational tasks across every sector to rapidly restore these essential services and infrastructure efficiently.

Where regions were not affected, their personnel have been redeployed to assist in restoring essential infrastructure in the hardest-hit areas. Ministries and institutions have also shifted priorities to ensure essential services are re-established. Roads, bridges, schools, water systems,  all require comprehensive repair.

Furthermore, if any ministries or institutions had other responsibilities, all of those have been set aside and this has been prioritised as a primary task. We have already developed a plan to establish these essential infrastructures.

We are working closely with critical institutions such as the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Water Supply and Drainage Board, as well as communication agencies and the Road Development Authority, providing the necessary support and coordination.

Therefore, I am confident that, within a very short period, we will be able to fully restore these infrastructures and services.

This scenario presents a significant challenge for a nation that has been endeavoring to elevate itself consistently and methodically. From small-scale self-employed workers to major industrialists, from farmers to livestock breeders, every sector has been severely impacted.

To restore these sectors quickly, we require a rapid, well-coordinated plan. Accordingly, emergency regulations have been enacted to provide legal and financial safeguards for efficient reconstruction. I assure every citizen that these emergency powers will not be misused for any other purpose.

In accordance with these emergency regulations, a Commissioner-General of Essential Services has been appointed, centralising all operations.

Essential services offices are open 24 hours and key officials in all major institutions are working round the clock, ensuring an effective centralised response.

Our next task is to transform our country into a state better than before. To reach that objective, we are in the process of setting up a Fund to gather the necessary resources for reconstruction. Additionally, we have formed a joint management committee comprising members from the private sector, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Presidential Secretariat to oversee the fund. They have been given a significant responsibility.

We can mobilise a substantial amount of funds required to rebuild our country. We are working very closely with friendly nations to secure their assistance. In addition, we are engaging with various international organisations to obtain their support. We are also reaching out to domestic business people and industrialists to contribute their assistance. Notably, at this time, Sri Lankan citizens living abroad are working with great effort and enthusiasm to provide support.

We are taking steps to ensure that they receive the assistance they need. For this reason, we must establish a strong fund to facilitate the country’s recovery from this disaster. We have already organised the necessary measures to mobilise and manage this fund effectively.

The Department of Irrigation has informed us of the damage that has occurred to the irrigation systems under its authority, as well as the funds required to restore them. Similarly, the Ministry of Agriculture has reported the destruction caused to the agricultural sector and the funds needed to rebuild it. We have communicated these requirements for all such sectors. You are requested to provide us, as soon as possible, with the plans for the reconstruction of your sector and the necessary provisions required for that purpose.

Accordingly, we have been able to rebuild our country through a very rapid development plan. History has overlooked chances that have compelled us to pursue long-term objectives and coexist as a nation, and we are resolute in making this a point of no return this time. In this difficult moment, we extend our gratitude to all the friendly nations that have already come forward to support us, to their leaders, citizens and international organisations. For the continuous support they provide for the reconstruction of our country, we have already established a well-organised mechanism to manage it.

At this decisive and calamitous moment, let us set aside all political differences for the sake of the country. Let us unite, free from distinctions of ethnicity, religion, party, or colour. There is ample time for politics, but there is little time to face this disaster. Let us come together to rebuild the nation. After the country has been rebuilt, we will have the opportunity to engage in politics separately. I have great confidence in this. I act with unwavering faith in the reconstruction of this country. I place my trust in the citizens of our nation. I trust in our armed forces, the police and the entire civil service.

I place my trust in the industrialists, entrepreneurs, intellectuals and innovators of this country. I also place my trust in Sri Lankans living abroad. Furthermore, I place our trust in the friendly nations that stand with us.

With this confidence and with a firm resolve that this country can be rebuilt, we have engaged in this responsibility. Certainly, we will build a better nation than what existed before. From now on, even if we start from scratch, we are ready to face this challenge.

For this collective effort, I invite everyone to unite without petty disagreements. Through national and international coordination, working in close collaboration and guided by our conscience, let us commit ourselves to achieving the goals we aspire to.

We believe that every dark cloud has a silver lining. We believe that these dark days will pass. Therefore, let us rise as one. Let us heal this tear-stained paradise. Let us build a radiant island. May the blessings of the Buddha and the support of the divine be with you all.
