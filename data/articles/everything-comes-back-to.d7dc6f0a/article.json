    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. We get to celebrate a very special birthday today\u2014The Spark just turned two!\u00a0  Over the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been bringing you all the news you need to know in climate tech and digging into some of the most fascinating and thorny topics from energy and transportation to agriculture and policy.\u00a0 In light of this milestone, I\u2019ve been looking back at some of the most popular editions of this newsletter, as well as some of my personal favorites\u2014and it\u2019s all got me thinking about where climate tech will go next. So let\u2019s look back together, and I\u2019ll also share what I\u2019m going to be watching out for as we go forward.",
    "It\u2019s prime time for batteries It will probably be a surprise to absolutely nobody that the past two years have been filled with battery news. (In case you\u2019re new and need a quick intro to my feelings on the topic, you can read the love letter to batteries I wrote this year for Valentine\u2019s Day.)\u00a0 We\u2019ve covered how abundant materials could help unlock cheaper, better batteries, and how new designs could help boost charging speeds. I\u2019ve dug into the data to share how quickly batteries are taking over the world, and how much faster we\u2019ll need to go to hit our climate goals.",
    "The next few years are going to be make-or-break for a lot of the alternative batteries we\u2019ve covered here, from sodium-ion to iron-air and even solid-state. We could see companies either fold or make it to the next stage of commercialization. I\u2019m watching to see which technologies will win\u2014there are many different options that could break out and succeed.\u00a0 A nuclear renaissance\u00a0 One topic I\u2019ve been covering closely, especially in the past year, is nuclear energy. We need zero-emissions options that are able to generate electricity 24-7. Nuclear fits that bill.\u00a0 Related StoryThese 15 companies are innovating in climate techWhat leading businesses reveal about the race to address climate change.",
    "Over the past two years, we\u2019ve seen some major ups and downs in the industry. Two new reactors have come online in the US, though they were years late and billions over budget. Germany completed its move away from nuclear energy, opting instead to go all in on intermittent renewables like solar and wind (and keep its coal plants open).\u00a0 Looking ahead, though, there are signs that we could see a nuclear energy resurgence. I\u2019ve written about interest in keeping older reactors online for longer and opening up plants that have previously shut down. And companies are aiming to deploy new advanced reactor designs, too.\u00a0  I\u2019m watching to see how creative the industry can get with squeezing everything it can out of existing assets. But I\u2019m especially interested to see whether new technologies keep making progress on getting regulatory approval, and whether the new designs can actually get built.\u00a0 Material world forever I\u2019ll never stop talking about materials\u2014from what we need to build all the technologies that are crucial for addressing climate change to how we can more smartly use the waste after those products reach the end of their lifetime.\u00a0 Recently, I wrote a feature story (and, of course, a related newsletter bringing you behind the scenes of my reporting) about how one rare earth metal gives us a look at some of the challenges we\u2019ll face with sourcing and recycling materials over the next century and beyond.\u00a0 It\u2019s fitting that the very first edition of The Spark was about my trip inside a battery recycling factory. Over the past two years, the world of climate tech has become much more tuned in to topics like mining, recycling, and critical minerals. I\u2019m interested to see how companies continue finding new, creative ways to get what they need to build everything they\u2019re trying to deploy.",
    "Milestones \u2026 and deadlines Overall, the last couple of years have been some of the most exciting and crucial in the race to address climate change, and it\u2019s only going to ramp up from here.\u00a0 Next year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, a landmark climate treaty that\u2019s guided most of the world\u2019s ambitions to limit warming to less than 2 \u00b0C (3.7 \u00b0F) above preindustrial levels. In the US, 2027 will mark five years since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, ushering in a new era of climate spending for the world\u2019s largest economy.\u00a0 The last two years have been a whirlwind of new ideas, research, and technologies, all aimed at limiting the most damaging effects of our changing climate. I\u2019m looking forward to following all the progress of the years to come with you as well.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Spark Another thing If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m willing to bet that you probably eat food. So you should join us for the latest edition of our subscriber-only Roundtables virtual event series, where I\u2019ll be speaking with my colleague James Temple about creating climate-friendly food.\u00a0 Joining us are experts from Pivot Bio and Rumin8, two of our 2024 Climate Tech Companies to Watch. It\u2019s going to be a fascinating discussion\u2014subscribers, register to join us here!\u00a0 And one more\u00a0 The growing energy demands of artificial intelligence represent a challenge for the grid. But the technology also offers an opportunity for energy tech, according to the authors of a new op-ed out this week. Check it out for more on why they say that AI and clean energy need each other.\u00a0 Keeping up with climate\u00a0\u00a0  Hurricane Milton reached wind speeds of over 160 miles per hour, making it a Category 5 storm. It\u2019s hitting the gulf coast of Florida in the coming days. See its projected path and the rainfall forecast. (Washington Post)\u00a0\u2192 Tampa Bay has seen destructive hurricanes, but there hasn\u2019t been a direct hit in decades. The metro area is home to over 3 million people. (Axios)",
    "Other regions are still reeling from Hurricane Helene, which dumped rainfall in western North Carolina in particular. The storm upends ideas of what a climate haven is. (Scientific American)\u2192 Two studies suggest that climate change significantly boosted rainfall from the storm. (NBC News) If you have an EV, it\u2019s best to keep it out of flood zones during hurricanes when possible. Batteries submerged in salt water can catch fire, though experts say it\u2019s relatively rare. (New York Times)",
    "The risk of winter blackouts in Great Britain is at the lowest in years, even though the country has shut down its last coal plant. The grid is expected to have plenty of energy, in part because of investment in renewables. (The Guardian) Voters in Kazakhstan have approved a plan to build the country\u2019s first nuclear power plant. The country has a complicated relationship with nuclear technology, since it was a testing ground for Soviet nuclear weapons. (Power)\u00a0 Revoy wants to bring battery swapping to heavy-duty trucks. The company\u2019s batteries can reduce the amount of diesel fuel a conventional truck needs to drive a route. (Heatmap)\u2192 I wrote earlier this year about another company building batteries into trailers in an effort to clean up distance trucking. (MIT Technology Review) hide"
