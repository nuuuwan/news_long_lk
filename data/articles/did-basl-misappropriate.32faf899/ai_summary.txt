Five members of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), including the body’s president and deputy, are accused of misappropriating funds intended to combat bribery and corruption in the country. The cash was provided by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Five unnamed members allegedly pocketed INR19m ($108k) of the INR21m Jica had given to the BASL. BASL president Kaushalya Navaratne has denied the claims, stating that the money was for “professional services”. JICA has stated that it has completed all payments to the BASL, and the matter should be taken up with that organisation.
