1. 🌿 Amazon ahead of its seven-year sustainability plan has purchased enough clean electricity to cover the energy demands of its global operations. 
2. 🌐 In contrast, Google’s energy demands due to AI operations increased its corporate emissions by 13% last year. 
3. 🌪 Both companies are addressing greenhouse-gas emissions differently; however, Google’s approach is considered more defensible. 
4. 🚀 A new approach suggests focusing on broader climate impacts rather than trying to balance out every ton of carbon dioxide emitted.
5. 🌲 The current net-zero model often involves purchasing cheap carbon credits involving tree planting, restoring ecosystems, and altering agriculture practices.
6. 💡 Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) create a similar claim that their climate gains are overstated, as clean-energy projects can increasingly compete on their own.
7. 🛍 Amazon's sustainability report noted it improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions by purchasing environmental attributes like RECs.
8. 📊 The Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group argues that Amazon's data centers are increasing demand for fossil fuels and that their claims of reaching clean-electricity goals are "creative accounting." 
9. 🔄 Google is moving away from purchasing carbon credits and towards developing broader solutions to mitigate climate change, including supporting new methods of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
10. 💻 Both Google and Amazon face increased challenges with the rising energy demands of AI and will need to continue to strive for energy efficiency and clean energy procurement.
