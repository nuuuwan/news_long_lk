    "Copenhagen has claimed the top spot in EIU\u2019s Global Liveability Index 2025, ending Vienna\u2019s three-year dominance. Copenhagen achieved perfect scores of 100 for stability, education and infrastructure, moving up from second place to become the world\u2019s most comfortable city to live in. The EIU\u2019s index assesses 173 cities worldwide across 30 indicators, categorised into stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.\u00a0This year\u2019s average score remains unchanged from last year, at 76.1 out of 100. However, this year\u2019s results reflect a continued decline in global stability, driven by intensifying geopolitical conflict and civil unrest.A free summary report can be downloaded here.Cities in western Europe and developed Asia continue to dominate the top of the rankings. Melbourne came in fourth, with Sydney and Adelaide also making the top ten. Other leading cities were spread across Japan, New Zealand and Canada.However, western European cities also appear on the list of the biggest movers down the ranks in 2025. All the cities covered in the UK (London, Manchester and Edinburgh) have dropped down the ranks, following widespread riots and rising homelessness. Two Canadian cities (Calgary, Toronto) are also among them, as we have lowered the healthcare scores for all four Canadian cities in our index. However, North American cities remain highly sought-after places to live in, with all 21 reporting the highest tier of liveability (defined as a score of 80 or above).\u00a0On a more positive note, scores for healthcare, education and infrastructure all saw marginal improvements on average. The Middle East and North Africa region registered the most significant gains in overall liveability, primarily driven by advancements in healthcare and education within cities in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\u00a0To find out how your city has fared, download the free summary report here.Understanding the challenges that impact an individual\u2019s lifestyle is crucial for businesses, governments, and academic institutions in shaping strategies and informing policies.
