    "What\u2019s happened?Qatar, together with US and Egyptian negotiators, helped to broker the ceasefire and hostage release agreement reached between Israel and Hamas that took effect on January\u00a019th. Qatar has won plaudits for its pivotal role in helping to secure the agreement.\u00a0We expect this to strengthen Qatar\u2019s position as a key hub for diplomacy and mediation in the Middle East, which will be bolstered further if the initial deal holds, and Qatar will be able to help advance negotiations on stages two and three of the\u00a0deal.Why does it matter?Qatar\u2019s mediation efforts in Gaza form part of an international soft-power strategy, which seeks to elevate the country\u2019s relevance to the international community. Qatar\u2019s mediating role is enabled by its wide range of bilateral relations, maintained in a web of sometimes conflicting alliances, which the Qatari government leverage for hosting talks between opposing parties.\u00a0The\u00a0emirate\u2019s success in helping to secure the crucial Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal should fortify its strategic position as a diplomacy hub\u00a0and provide a backstop of global support for the small and vulnerable country sandwiched between regional heavyweights in the volatile Middle East region.Qatar had faced heavy criticism in recent years, owing to its controversial hosting of the political office of Hamas since 2011, when the Palestinian group left Syria. However, the office was opened at the behest of the US, and Qatari officials repeatedly argued that Hamas\u2019s presence did not signify backing for the group but was instead a way of facilitating essential dialogue. In the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, offered the then US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the option of closing Hamas\u2019s office in the Qatari capital, Doha. Mr\u00a0Blinken turned down the offer as he viewed Hamas\u2019s Doha office as useful for anticipated negotiations. Nonetheless, Qatar suspended its mediation efforts and agreed to expel Hamas\u2019s political leadership from its territory in November 2024, when the US administration shifted its position on the issue after Hamas rejected a ceasefire-hostage proposal. Qatar has continued to play a key role and has clearly been effective in mediating the negotiations between Israel and Hamas after the expulsion of the latter\u2019s political leadership from its territory.What next?Qatar\u2019s foreign policy will continue to be built around counterbalancing alliances, which, in practice, entails a very difficult balancing act to maintain a broadly neutral position\u00a0when dealing with competing factions and conflict hotspots.\u00a0High on the list of foreign policy objectives in 2025 will be upholding the initial ceasefire and hostage release deal\u00a0between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, advancing negotiations on stages two and three of the deal, preventing the situation in Syria from spiralling into chaos and easing tensions between Israel and Iran. Addressing these issues will be a major test for Qatar\u2019s mediation skills and its status as a leading mediator in the Middle East during\u00a02025.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
