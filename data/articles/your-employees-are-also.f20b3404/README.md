Research shows that 73% of people surveyed in the U.S. have some type of caregiving responsibility. So, how can you better recognize this important role in your employees’ lives, understand how it impacts their work, and better support them? Articles and podcasts from HBR’s archive suggests five key strategies: gather better data, understand that caregiving includes — and goes beyond — childcare, work to adapt your company’s caregiving policies and culture, recognize that caregivers make great employees, and advocate for better public policy.

Caregivers are most certainly among your employes. According to a recent study from Harvard Business School’s Managing the Future of Work project, 73% of people surveyed in the U.S. “reported having some type of current caregiving responsibility.” This may involve caring for children, parents, siblings, other relatives, friends, neighbors, or all of the above.
