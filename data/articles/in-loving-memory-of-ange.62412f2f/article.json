    "Angela\u2019s early years were infused with cultural richness and intellectual curiosity but also the pain of abandonment and loneliness. She carried this worldly upbringing into her life, which unfolded across five countries and countless adventures, giving her the ability to understand human nature",
    "In the early hours of 17 November 2024, we lost an extraordinary soul who touched countless lives during her 94 years on this earth. Angela Kadirgamar was a woman of remarkable charm, grace, and wisdom, whose presence brought warmth, laughter, and inspiration to all who knew her. Her passing leaves a profound sense of loss, but her legacy endures in the hearts of her family, friends, and all who were privileged to cross her path.",
    "Born in Le Touquet, France, on 22 June 1930, Angela was the daughter of Marcus Malik, a priest in Oxford, and a French mother, Henriette Benoit, who was involved in business. Raised in France and later sent to India to foster families during World War II, she was separated at a young age from her parents and brother, Rex, an event that marked her for life. Angela\u2019s early years were infused with cultural richness and intellectual curiosity but also the pain of abandonment and loneliness. She carried this worldly upbringing into her life, which unfolded across five countries and countless adventures, giving her the ability to understand human nature.",
    "An artist in every sense of the word",
    "Angela was an artist in every sense of the word. She was a model and film actor in London during the 1950s, most notably doubling for Ava Gardner in \u2018Bhowani Junction\u2019. She also experimented with dance as a member of the Ram Gopal troupe and acted in Ceylonese theatre, notably playing the lead in \u2018Mother Courage\u2019. Had she pursued her acting career in England, she would have undoubtedly become famous, but her deep longing for family led her down a different path in life when she married Lakshman Kadirgamar in 1956.",
    "Later in life, Angela obtained a degree in art from the prestigious Ruskin School of Art in Oxford. Her strength lay in her understanding of human anatomy, which made her an outstanding sculptor. Her works were showcased in exhibitions across Europe and Sri Lanka. She was also a gifted porcelain restorer and occasionally taught art.",
    "Angela\u2019s creative talents were only rivalled by her gifts in mysticism. Highly intuitive, she was fascinated by esoteric and intuitive arts, practicing palmistry, tarot reading, and I Ching. She shared insights through stories of mystical experiences, memories of other lives, and a near-death encounter in Machu Picchu, Peru, in 1981, where she later admitted she could not yet leave her children.",
    "Her elegance and charm were legendary. Even in the later years of her life, when living alone, she dressed for dinner and set the table, even just for herself. She was an incredible hostess, and the parties she organised in Oxford, Colombo, Geneva, and the French countryside were legendary. Her exotic beauty and poise were admired by all, and her life was filled with extraordinary moments\u2014meeting the Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace, charming the former French Prime Minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France, and captivating the Maharaja of Mysore.",
    "As a devoted mother to her three children\u2014Mohan (from her first marriage), Ajita, and Ragi\u2014she embodied the values of love, service, and sacrifice. She adored her four grandchildren (Keira, Jhivan, Safiyeh, and Imara) and cherished the joy of meeting her great-granddaughter, Jasmim, in the last years of her life. Although she yearned to return to France, her sense of duty and attachment to her children and grandchildren kept her in Sri Lanka.",
    "Angela\u2019s ability to touch lives with her kindness and wisdom was unparalleled. She was a confidante, a companion over cups of coffee, and a light in the lives of her friends.",
    "A dear friend wrote: \u201cA remarkable person. Beautiful, kind, loving, and talented. She taught me many things I would never have known without her help. I think of her often and miss her. May Allah give her the highest place in heaven.\u201d",
    "She treated employees as family, supporting them in whatever way she could, encouraging them to save, paying for their children\u2019s education, and helping them build their futures. She helped domestics with medical expenses, supported one carer through cancer treatment, and later continued monthly donations for her children after her passing.",
    "In her final years, Angela faced life\u2019s challenges with remarkable strength and grace. Even after enduring physical setbacks, such as a broken hip, a stroke, and debilitating vertigo, she remained positive and resilient. Her indomitable spirit taught those around her the value of perseverance, gratitude, and above all, love.",
    "Angela found peace, forgiveness, and deep acceptance with those who had abandoned or hurt her and, in turn, forgave herself for any hurts she had caused. She believed deeply in seeking answers to life\u2019s mysteries, drawing from many spiritual traditions and believing in one universal force that connects us all. \u201cTurn the other cheek, understand the other, try to forgive,\u201d was her approach to life in this complex world.",
    "As a friend beautifully expressed: \u201cI was privileged to have had her friendship and affection. Rest in peace now, my dear friend. There will be no other like you in my life. Forever in my memories.\u201d",
    "Angela loved traveling and did so extensively, exploring over 35 countries. Her last overseas journey to Portugal at 92 was a testament to her stamina and curiosity. She marvelled at the pyramids in Egypt, travelled down the Amazon River, explored Machu Picchu, and took road trips across Europe. Each adventure deepened her understanding of human nature and history, helping her unravel the mysteries of life.",
    "Once, she said, \u201cI haven\u2019t achieved anything in this life.\u201d Her family promptly made a list of over 50 accomplishments. At the end, she smiled and simply said, \u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
    "Fortunately, she penned some of her life stories and experiences in her autobiography, \u2018All My Ghosts, The Last Regression\u2019, to be published in 2025.",
    "Angela, Mama\u2014you will live on in our hearts, our memories, and the stories we will continue to tell about you, though it is impossible to do justice in words to everything you were.",
    "Thank you for everything you gave us and for the wonderful, rich, long life you lived and shared. Rest now, beloved Angela, in eternal peace and infinite love.",
    "Ajita and Ragi Kadirgamar"
