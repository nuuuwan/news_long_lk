    "When interviewing for jobs, it\u2019s critical to let your authenticity shine through. Showing your interviewer your true self will help you connect with them \u2014 and stand out from your competition. Authenticity is about being genuine, not flawless; your personality and unique communication style are assets. According to the author, you should focus more on being yourself than being perfect, remembering every talking point, or presenting someone you\u2019re not. That way, if you get the job, you can feel confident you\u2019re in the right place, and if you don\u2019t get the job, you\u2019ll at least feel good about not compromising yourself or your values in the interview for a job that wasn\u2019t the right fit.",
    "Interviewing for jobs is a notoriously uncomfortable experience. Candidates have mere minutes to impress recruiters, hiring managers, and interview panels \u2014\u00a0and the pressure can lead them to adopt an unnatural, overly formal demeanor or otherwise obscure their true selves. That makes it hard for interviewers to establish a genuine connection and envision a candidate as a potential team member.",
