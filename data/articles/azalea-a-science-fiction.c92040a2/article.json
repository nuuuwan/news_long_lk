Tascha squeezes into the small space behind her, kisses her on the cheek.\u00a0 \u201cCan you maybe put that in your head?\u201d  Related StoryI used generative AI to turn my story into a comic\u2014and you can tooBy pulling together several different generative models into an easy-to-use package controlled with the push of a button, Lore Machine heralds the arrival of one-click AI.",
    "Xia doesn\u2019t put it in her head, but she at least lowers the volume with a click of her tongue. ElectoPod\u2019s never-ending shouting match becomes something more akin to ocean noise, where only occasional angry waves splash through the kitchen.\u00a0  Tascha digs through the fridge, looking for something that isn\u2019t kale or crickets. Finds a BitterBucketBrew and cracks it open. The coffee comes from gengineered plants that can survive higher latitudes. Caffeine in heaps, plus a proprietary process to filter out almost all endocrine disruptors, phthalates, microplastics, arsenic, and lead. Xia says it isn\u2019t as good as coffee grown from heirloom stocks. It\u2019s not natural, she says. Xia also says that a 99% filtration rate isn\u2019t all that great when hormone mimics are dangerous in parts per trillion.\u00a0 For a refugee, Xia can be awfully picky.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cYou should be paying attention to the election,\u201d Xia says. \u201cThis is your country.\u201d Tascha sips her coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have you.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you run for district carbon board?\u201d Xia presses.\u00a0 \u201cBecause then I\u2019d have to deal with people. Anyway, I don\u2019t have time. I\u2019m trying to make bonus so we can get into Azalea.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you don\u2019t make time, someone stupid will. Gribaldi is running again. In Texas\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Tascha kisses Xia on the forehead. \u201cEven Gribaldi\u2019s not as stupid as Texas.\u201d\u00a0  Xia makes a biting motion at Tascha, deliberately turning up the volume in the kitchen. Is that passive-aggressive?\u00a0 Or aggressive-aggressive?\u00a0 Regardless, ElectoPod once again floods the kitchen with the latest depressing news. A new generation of nearly undetectable AI proxies are battling it out for mindshare as November approaches. An ocean of microtargeted content is pouring into people\u2019s feeds, custom-generated on-the-fly ads and entertainment based on mountains of tracking data\u2014all of it illegally obtained offshore, all of it tailored to sway public opinion\u2014and no one knows who or what is generating it. It\u2019s enough to make Tascha think she should have fought through her ADHD and gotten her programming degree. Someone has to be making money off that.",
    "Advertisement Instead, Tascha clicks her tongue and turns on her own feed. Peace instantly envelops her, as ElectoMute smothers ElectoPod. Custom-tuned bone-conducted vibrations hum through her skull, perfectly canceling out the sound waves of Xia\u2019s obsession. ElectoMute is Tascha\u2019s only paid subscription. It\u2019s not even sound, Xia complains every time she sees the monthly bill. A symptom of Late-Stage Capitalism. Paying to make the noise of another feed go away.\u00a0 Tascha calls it the best $50 a month she\u2019s ever spent.\u00a0 Sometimes, it\u2019s just nicer to shut things out. If Tascha\u2019s honest, it\u2019s always nicer to shut things out. Ever since she got her first bone implants on recommendation of the school counselor to help her focus and calm herself, she\u2019s been a fan of shutting things out. People are both distracting and a hassle. Tascha is still sort of amazed that Xia doesn\u2019t get on her nerves more. Sure, she also has another\u2014very secret\u2014mute feed tuned to Xia\u2019s voice \u2026 but doesn\u2019t everyone put their relationship on mute sometimes?  Xia is pushing a smoothie across the table at her. Her lips make noise shapes. \u201cNo smoothie?\u201d\u00a0 Tascha shuts off ElectoMute and XiaMute. \u201cDid you know the plywood they\u2019re using on the worksite is made of mushrooms?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSo?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like, mushroom-hemp composite. I could bring some back for your smoothies.\u201d \u201cVery funny.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s carbon negative. You\u2019d love it.\u201d\u00a0 Xia gives her a sharp look. \u201cDon\u2019t be cute. I\u2019ll take it from the kid who lost her whole town to a tornado, not from you.\u201d\u00a0 Xia volunteers at the Georgia Displacement Authority. She doesn\u2019t have a full work permit yet, but she can volunteer, so, of course, she does.\u00a0 Xia, always looking out for everyone.\u00a0 Tascha nurses her smoothie. Her father says that relationships are about compromise. If the worst thing about Xia is kale-cricket smoothies, Tascha knows she\u2019s a winner. She forces down the last of the smoothie and gets up from the table.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d\u00a0 Xia\u2019s lips move again, making more mouth shapes.\u00a0 Tascha tunes back in. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI said, make sure your frigrig\u2019s charged. It\u2019s hot today.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always charged. They charge them every shift.\u201d Xia is undeterred. \u201cAnd swap out your mask filters. Canada\u2019s burning up again.\u201d   \u201cHow is there even any forest left?\u201d",
    "Janet\u2019s voice crackles in Tascha\u2019s ear as they dangle off their rappelling lines, swinging from point to point in their harnesses. The gray soup of Canada\u2019s burning forests envelops them.\u00a0 \u201cHow are we in Atlanta, sucking smoke from fucking Canada?\u201d Janet continues. \u201cAre we not America? Do we not have a long and honorable tradition of blockades, border checkpoints, and deportation? If we can keep Texas and Florida out, why not Burnt Canadians? Put up a sign: BC: Not Fucking Welcome.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re stitching solar, dangling 300 feet in the air, working their way down Tower 3 of the new Azalea Arcology. Tying window electrics, solar paint, and cell panels together. The mix is meant to make a lovely pattern (azaleas, in fact) on the face of the arcology structure, but the architect should be shot, because the electronics are a hassle and Tascha\u2019s crew is behind schedule.  Most of the arcology is fast-attach, standardized like Lego blocks, built in factories, then autonomously shipped to the site and popped together, as simple as a kit. In the early stages, Azalea was just swarms of bots digging, grading, and auto-\u00adassembling according to plan, knitting together the bones and skin of an entire new city of 10,000. Now that they\u2019re at final finishing stages, though, humans are taking back the site. The complex patterns of varied electrical components still need a clever human touch, which is why Tascha\u2019s crew is out in the Atlanta swelter, nearly mummified in Day-Glo frigrigs to keep the heat at bay.",
    "It\u2019s one thing to bike to work with just a filter mask and a chilled helmet to keep you cool; it\u2019s a whole other thing to hang off the side of a building all day when wet-bulb temps push into the 40s.\u00a0 \u201cI heard someone was camping up in Alberta and lit a bunch of beetle kill on fire. Whole state\u2019s going up.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cIs it a state or a province?\u201d \u201cHow the fuck would I know?\u201d   \u201cCan we get off the coms, people?\u201d Latoya, their crew lead, interrupts. \u201cSome of us are trying to make bonus.\u201d \u201cYeah, Janet, get to work.\u201d A whole chorus of agreement follows from the rest of the crew. \u201cYeah, Janet, get to work.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah, Janet, get to work.\u201d \u201cWhere the fuck is Janet? I can\u2019t even see her in this smoke. It\u2019s like pea soup.\u201d\u00a0  Related StoryCanada\u2019s 2023 wildfires produced more emissions than fossil fuels in most countriesIf they were a country they\u2019d rank as the fourth-highest emitter, behind only China, the US, and India.",
    "Tascha slides across to a bank of PV windows and takes a sip from her frigrig reservoir. Cool water, sucked out of the humid air by the suit. Far below, cyclists zip down the street, their chilled jackets boosted by their bike batteries, popping in and out of view from under the street\u2019s shading solar shelters and tree foliage. They look like schools of minnows. Heavy cargo vans and zip buses string out in a line, following programmed one-way routes to give most of the space to cyclists. AItlantis, the city management software, must have detected an increase in people waiting at bus shelters, because a surge of robotic zip buses is swarming toward Obama Greenway.\u00a0 Tascha starts splicing and soldering a cluster of energy-\u00adgenerating windows to the solar paint that surrounds them, and then hooking the whole into wires that will carry the energy into the main arcology grid. It\u2019s fussy work. Janet keeps bitching about the smoke.",
    "\u201cI swear,\u201d she says, as she spools down and jerks to a stop next to Tascha. \u201cI\u2019m just going up there and lighting the rest of that fucking forest on fire. I mean, shit, let\u2019s get it over with\u2014Hey. Tascha. You doing okay?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine, why?\u201d \u201cYou missed a connection.\u201d\u00a0 Tascha blinks away sweat that\u2019s dripping in her eyes. \u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d Janet reaches into the nested wires. Tightens screws. Runs her own diagnostic. Everything glows green. \u201cCan\u2019t have our pretty solar design fail before it even gets hooked up, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Yeah.\u201d Tascha takes another sip of water. The frigrig\u2019s reservoir and heat pump should be keeping it ice cold, but it\u2019s more lukewarm. \u201cHey, can you check my frigrig battery?\u201d\u00a0 Janet spins her around, checks her back. \u201cLooks good to me. Seventy percent.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPlugged in tight?\u201d\u00a0 Tugs and jerks. \u201cYeah. All good. All tight.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s keep it moving, people. I want to finish this wall today,\u201d Latoya says over the com. \u201cLet\u2019s get our bonus, right? For once?\u201d \u201cIf they designed these connections for frigrig gloves, this would go faster,\u201d Janet says. \u201cGet back to work, Janet.\u201d\u00a0 They all say it at the same time, and laugh.  Tascha\u2019s father claims people didn\u2019t wear any kind of cooling clothing in the old days. They wore tank tops and shorts, and sure they sweated buckets, but people didn\u2019t have to completely hide from the heat. Tascha can\u2019t imagine it. The only person Tascha knows who spends any time out in the heat willingly is Xia. Sometimes Xia lies nude on their balcony, letting the sun burn down on her, her skin sheened with sweat, salt jewels trickling lazily down the curves of her ribs.\u00a0  There\u2019s something seductive about the contrast between Xia\u2019s sun-browned flesh and the pale spiderweb of lines where the filter mask and its straps have hugged her face.  It\u2019s fascinating and horrifying, like watching someone cook in an oven.",
    "Xia says it\u2019s like a giant natural sauna, so why wouldn\u2019t she take advantage of it? Saunas are good for you. Just ask the Finns. Xia also claims she\u2019s epigenetically advantaged thanks to the Texas grid constantly failing during her childhood. Her body has been trained to survive any heat\u2014which is so categorically bullshit that Tascha doesn\u2019t even bother to argue. But Tascha does like Xia\u2019s tan lines. There\u2019s something seductive about the contrast between Xia\u2019s sun-browned flesh and the pale spiderweb of lines where the filter mask and its straps have hugged her face. When Tascha ran her fingers over the tan lines one night, Xia told her it was a fetish.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s called FMT,\u201d Xia said. \u201cFilter mask tan lines. Very Rule 34.\u201d  For reasons Tascha can\u2019t fully explain, she\u2019s annoyed that something that felt personal and private is actually a well-trodden porn search. Even when she\u2019s alone in her own mind, tentatively feeling her way into real intimacy with Xia for the first time in her life, she\u2019s still surrounded by people. At this very moment, there\u2019s probably some algorithm custom-tailoring political attack ads based on FMT. It probably already knows about Tascha.\u00a0 People ruin everything.   \u201cGoddamn, that looks like the good life.\u201d\u00a0 Janet is peering in through another cluster of windows that they\u2019re supposed to be hooking up. \u201cCheck it. You can see the waterfall and the river from here. It\u2019s finished!\u201d Advertisement Tascha realizes that she\u2019s been leaning her head against the glass. She wipes sweat out of her eyes and peers through the PV glaze. Sure enough, the artificial river meanders along under high glass gallery arches, doing its job of water repurification and cooling as it winds through the arcology, then out under the dome of a semi-wild park, where lots of fast-growing carbon-sink cypress and citrus are growing, then cascading and pooling down through a series of rapids down into the artificial canyon the arcology uses for geocooling. Deep down in the shadows, Tascha glimpses a series of artificial lakes where mercury-free fish are destined to be raised. \u00a0 \u201cSomeone\u2019s kayaking!\u201d A bright-yellow kayak has entered the top of the cataracts, some lunatic with a red helmet paddling down through the water features. Now that Tascha is looking closely, she can see that another whole part of the canyon is destined to be climbing walls.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m definitely buying in,\u201d Janet says. \u201cYou buying in? We get top slots in the lottery, since we worked on it.\u201d",
    "\u201cI guess it depends if we get bonus.\u201d Tascha\u2019s hands feel clumsy. She drops the leads. \u201cAre you hot? I think my suit\u2019s fritzing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou want to tap out early, get it checked?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just another couple hours. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Related StoryThis company makes wood products without treesForay Bioscience is opening up possibilities for biomanufacturing in forestry.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t try and muscle through\u2014\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m fine. Xia keeps telling me saunas are good for you. Let\u2019s get our bonus.\u201d\u00a0 Now that she\u2019s sure her frigrig is fritzing, the heat becomes more bearable. She just imagines Xia, sunbathing, sweating it out intentionally. If Xia can take it, Tascha can take it. Christ, Xia complains if Tascha even turns up the A/C in the condo. She\u2019s got the poverty mentality of all Texans, where people dying for lack of electricity is one of the independent territory\u2019s founding principles.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Tascha had explained, the first time they got in a fight over what constituted a reasonable temperature. \u201cThe grid\u2019s in surplus. We\u2019re doing them a favor by using it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d \u201cI can literally air-condition the balcony if I want. If you just open the doors I can knock it down 15 degrees. I can make you comfortable out there.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d It makes Tascha want to move into Azalea even more. The whole place is kept at reasonable temperatures all day, every day. Outdoor Living, Indoors! is the arcology\u2019s tagline, and it sounds like heaven. No wildfire smoke. Controlled temps. All those parks and rec trails and outdoor caf\u00e9s. The energy systems connected to the cooling systems connected to the hydroponics systems, all of it managed by the unfortunately named AIzalIA Management Software that should, according to the brochure, make the entire arcology not only function as a carbon sink but also run an energy surplus that all the residents will profit from.\u00a0  Xia hates the idea of it.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s more privatization. You can\u2019t privatize municipal services. It drains support for centralized government and general infrastructure. The rich live great, and the poor die like flies.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t Texas. That\u2019s not how we do it here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not Texas \u2026 yet. If you let the rich live apart from the rest, eventually they start to undermine everything.\u201d \u201cCan you just enjoy things, for once? Maybe practice a little optimism?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt happened with schools. It will happen with infrastructure if you let it.\u201d \u201cYou know, this is exactly why the High Reverend of Texas has a warrant out for you. You\u2019re lucky we don\u2019t extradite.\u201d  Xia makes a face. Tascha feels bad. Xia worrying is the same as Xia getting involved is the same as Xia making trouble is the same as Xia taking care of people is the same as Xia taking care of Tascha. It\u2019s what she does. Tascha kisses her on the forehead. \u201cNot everything is a plot to destroy the world.\u201d  \u201cThis is exactly how Florida drowned itself. The rich got rich, and then they got on their private jets and flew away when Miami drowned. They always planned on kissing off to somewhere else. You can\u2019t let these people undermine everything and then run away to hide with all their wealth.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Azalea is about\u2014\u201d \u201cYeah? What\u2019s the buy-in?\u201d   \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. You know how much it costs to build. This ain\u2019t cheap tech.\u201d Advertisement \u201cYou know what would have been cheap? Just fixing the problem in the beginning so we all could just have gone on \u00adoutdoor living, you know, outdoors. But rich people figured they\u2019d be protected, so they didn\u2019t give a shit. They\u2019d move to New Zealand, right? They\u2019d make their own personal compounds. They\u2019d hire guards. They\u2019d make Azaleas and they\u2019d be fine\u2014\u201d \u201cBut we can buy in too! If I make bonus, we\u2019ll have enough\u2014\u201d\u00a0 Xia bites her teeth, hard. ElectoPod streams into Tascha\u2019s head, bypassing ElectoMute: a pair of commentary hosts, haranguing one another. \u201cI think we need to remember that people in Florida had incomplete information.\u201d  \u201cBullshit. They had everything they needed.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCome on, Sunita. No one sets out to drown themselves! The people who drowned weren\u2019t the people who made the disaster plans. Florida\u2019s governor didn\u2019t care how many people died. His real estate donors didn\u2019t care. They had the numbers. They knew how much bigger storm surges were going to get\u2014\u201d Related StoryMeet the economist who wants the field to account for natureGretchen Daily is working to make the environment more of an element in economic decision-making.",
    "\u201cSo no one had a clue at all? They were just sitting in the dark like mushrooms? Come on, Maria. Let\u2019s listen to this.\u201d A news announcer cuts in, old news coverage: \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the South Beach seawall. We can see the water coming up, coming through. We don\u2019t know how many people are still in lower Miami. Obviously, this brings to mind the levee break in New Orleans in the early 2000s. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Florida in this trying time.\u201d\u00a0 The argument between the hosts resumes.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cReminiscent of New Orleans! They had 70 years of warning! Literally everyone knew. Not just the governor! Not just his real estate donors. Don\u2019t bother defending them, Maria. People got exactly what they signed up for. They deserved it.\u201d Tascha wants to argue with Xia. To point out that ElectoPod is saying that it wasn\u2019t just rich people, that everyone was stupid, that everyone went along. Bottom line, people in general are just stupid, but Xia keeps talking at her, and XiaMute doesn\u2019t seem to be working.  \u201cWake up, Tascha! You can\u2019t just seal yourself off from people.\u201d \u201cWake up, Tascha! You have to be involved. If you don\u2019t get involved, stupid people will.\u201d \u201cWake up, Tascha! If you don\u2019t pay attention, other people will decide for you.\u201d \u201cWake up Tascha! I know about XiaMute.\u201d \u201cWake up!\u201d \u201cWake up!\u201d \u201cWake up!\u201d  Tascha comes awake, gasping. Water rushes around her. She thrashes, trying to swim, trying to keep her head above water. Advertisement \u201cWhoa, girl! Take it easy!\u201d Janet is cradling her in her arms, along with some woman in a red helmet.\u00a0 The kayaker?\u00a0 They\u2019re in the river, Tascha realizes. They\u2019re inside Azalea. The kayaker and Janet are supporting her, holding her up as water flows and tugs around her. The rest of the construction crew clusters on the riverbank, peering through the cattails, watching with concern. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d Latoya calls. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d the kayaker calls back.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was talking to Xia \u2026\u201d \u201cXia\u2019s coming,\u201d Janet says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Xia. Just lay back. That\u2019s right. Let\u2019s get you cool.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be pissed.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be glad you\u2019re alive. Quit fussing.\u201d  Tascha lets herself sink back, lets Janet and the kayaker buoy her up. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d  Tascha stares up at the arching solar glass overhead as the river flows around her. Smoke is thick out there, but she can\u2019t smell it in here.  \u201cYou heatstroked. And then you tried to pop your harness.\u201d Janet laughs. \u201cYou almost went all the way to the ground before your safeties caught you. Shhh. Relax. You\u2019re fine now. Took us a bit to get you untangled and inside. Just float. Stay easy. Let the water do its thing. You were cooking.\u201d Advertisement\u201cI messed up our bonus\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We got you. All you need to do is let this nice water chill you out.\u201d Tascha stares up at the arching solar glass overhead as the river flows around her. Smoke is thick out there, but she can\u2019t smell it in here. Here, she smells orange blossoms. Smells green ferns ... cattails \u2026 warm mud. Life.\u00a0 \u201cI should have tapped out when my suit died. I should have stopped to fix it.\u201d \u201cYeah, well.\u201d Janet laughs. \u201cWe always see things clearer after we\u2019ve screwed them up.\u201d Paolo Bacigalupi is an internationally best-selling author of speculative fiction.
