Achieving true omnichannel excellence in luxury retail is a formidable challenge due to the inherent need for high-touch customer experiences and the complexity of managing multiple distribution channels, including e-commerce and third-party resellers. There are five critical measures that luxury brands must undertake to overcome these obstacles and establish a consistent, seamless customer experience across all channels. These strategies include setting a timeline for taking over third-party channels, consolidating retail and wholesale leadership roles, moving toward consignment sales, adopting a franchise model, and practicing staff secondment to third-party stores. While these steps are not easy and require strong leadership and commitment, they are essential for luxury brands to achieve true omnichannel excellence.

Any experienced executive in the luxury trade will tell you that achieving true omnichannel excellence for luxury goods is next to impossible. The very nature of luxury retailing — which requires a high human touch — almost guarantees that the service experience will differ from store to store and across regions. This is compounded as soon as the luxury brand attempts to distribute its products via multiple channel types and becomes even messier when the distribution system includes e-commerce sales, some of which are brand-operated whereas others are reseller-managed.
