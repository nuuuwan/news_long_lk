    "The experience of 46 years of the operation of the 1978 Constitution shows that the executive",
    "presidential system has not delivered on any of the aims for which it was introduced",
    "We the undersigned call upon all candidates contesting the forthcoming 2024 Presidential election to firmly and publicly commit to the abolition of the executive presidential system within the first year of the next Parliament.",
    "The experience of 46 years of the operation of the 1978 Constitution shows that the executive presidential system has not delivered on any of the aims for which it was introduced: accelerated and sustained economic growth and development; communal harmony; and political stability. Executive presidentialism has only had a negligible impact on development. It has worsened rather than improved peace and stability, by accelerating ethnic conflict and making our political system prone to frequent crises.",
    "The executive presidential system produces these undesirable outcomes because, through its lack of accountability and responsiveness, it allows authoritarianism, corruption, and incompetence to trump the common good of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans.",
    "We therefore strongly believe that this is the single most important reform that is essential for the meaningful and irreversible re-democratisation of Sri Lanka.",
    "While recent experience since 2022 has only highlighted the autocratic potential of this system, we recall that in the history of presidential elections since 1988, there have been more popular mandates than not for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. Most recently, the people clearly made the connection between this system and the causes of bad governance and economic collapse when, during the Aragalaya of 2022, they called for \u2018system change\u2019. The only way \u2018system change\u2019 can even begin to be delivered is by abolishing the Executive Presidency.",
