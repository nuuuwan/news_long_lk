1. 🏛️ The Government has proposed a wealth tax via an '"imputed rental income" on property by 1 April 2025.
2. 💸 "Imputed rental income" means the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented.
3. 🏠 This is similar to what Local Councils are collecting from property owners in Municipality Rates, essentially a form of double-taxation. 
4. 🏦 Versus this, actual income and wealth should be the main interest of the Inland Revenue, not Municipalities.
5. ⚖️ The current method for assessing Municipal rates is considered discriminatory and puts rate payers at the mercy of the assessor. 
6. 📝 For assessing rates, the Assessor uses three criteria: area of building, age of building, and condition & facilities, which is seen as faulty.
7. 🏚️ An example of a faulty system is Pettah, where a 100-year-old building with basic amenities located in the wholesale trading area could demand a higher rent than a superior building in a less desirable location.
8. 🎭 High retail areas like Pettah, show the complexity of rental values depending on location, type of business, and supply and demand.
9. 🚧 The government is planning to re-calculate the imputed rental income, further empowering assessors and leading to potential abuse.
10. 💡 The writer suggests simplifying Council tax to be based only on land extent, built area, and type of usage, instead of imputed income.
