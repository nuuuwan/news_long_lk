    "Generative AI has demonstrated the potential to significantly outperform human CEOs in strategic decision-making by excelling in data-driven tasks like product design and market optimization. In an experiment simulating the automotive industry, AI models outpaced human participants in market share and profitability but faltered in handling unpredictable disruptions, leading to faster dismissals by virtual boards. While AI\u2019s ability to analyze complex data sets and iterate rapidly could revolutionize corporate strategy, it lacks the intuition and foresight required to navigate black swan events. Rather than fully replacing human CEOs, AI is poised to augment leadership by enhancing data analysis and operational efficiency, leaving humans to focus on long-term vision, ethics, and adaptability in dynamic markets. The future of leadership will likely be a hybrid model where AI complements human decision-making.",
