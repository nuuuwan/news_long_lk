Sri Lanka's major political parties are shifting their strategies as the possibility of elections grows. There are three main factors affecting the political landscape: increased power concentration among the elite, possible departure of the Rajapaksas from President Ranil Wickremesinghe's government, and various trade union strikes led by the National Peopleâ€™s Power. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, the party associated with the Rajapaksa faction, appears to be withdrawing its support for Wickremesinghe's government. As for the President, his options seem to be shrinking due to issues such as the conduct of his ministers and his lack of achievement in courting Tamil minority political parties. Meanwhile, the trade-union strikes driven by economic anger and resistance to state-owned enterprise reforms are indicative of the NPP gaining strength.
