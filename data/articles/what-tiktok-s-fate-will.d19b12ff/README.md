Whether or not TikTok is banned in the U.S., the saga has broad reaching implications for global business. Three experts explain the possible ramifications of TikTok’s fate — and the larger trends that are shaping it. First, Sarah Kreps of Cornell argues that the decision highlights the increasing entanglement of technology, geopolitics, and regulation. The key challenge is that tech competition is no longer confined to Silicon Valley or Shenzhen — it’s a central front in global geopolitics. Then, Andy Wu of Harvard Business School explains that business leaders worldwide must now grapple with the possibility that the internet could become more closed at any moment. They need to watch policy, regulations, and pressure on platforms and related services, and recognize that they are also vulnerable to pressure put on a small number of gatekeeper companies. Finally, Konstantinos Komaitis of the Atlantic Council argues that the decision could have sweeping implications for global governance of the internet, and encourage more robust interventions from both authoritarian and democratic governments, as well as international bodies such as the United Nations.

Yet again, the saga of the U.S. TikTok ban has entered a new chapter. After a fast-tracked Supreme Court decision upheld the law mandating that U.S. operations either be severed from Chinese ownership or go dark, President Trump signed an executive order delaying enforcement of the new law for 75 days. The legality and enforceability of that order are still unclear, and so the reprieve is a tentative one, for the moment.
