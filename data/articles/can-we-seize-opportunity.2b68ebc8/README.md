Noisy behaviour when travelling in trains, lack of street ethics and loud voices have created a displeasure for some Sri Lankans in Japan

A window of opportunity is emerging in Japan for 820,000 skilled workers from overseas over the coming five years, sharply expanding previous projections to address growing labour shortages. The figure is more than twice that for the five-year period up to 2024 set in 2019. Every five years, the government of Japan determines the number of workers it anticipates for each

The new plan of the Government of Japan aims to train unskilled foreign workers in specific skills and attain a certain proficiency of the Japanese language in three years so that they can then move on to specified skilled worker visas with longer periods of validity and better working conditions. This new initiative replaces the current foreign trainee program, which has often been criticised for bad working conditions and participants being used as cheap labour.

Are we not losing $ 700 to 750 per month for every worker who goes to the Middle East?

As per the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment in 2024 the largest number of Sri Lankans immigrated to Kuwait, with 77,546 individuals taking up work there. The United Arab Emirates ranked second, received 51,550 workers from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was able to send only 16,523 to Japan even though Japan paid much higher wages compared to Kuwait and United Arab Emirates. Earnings per month per employee in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are approximately $ 390 and $ 300 respectively. Japan on the other hand offers a minimum monthly salary of approximately $ 1,175, which is almost 3.5x more.

Why is Sri Lanka behind many others?

The given chart illustrates the foreigners living in Japan and Sri Lanka ranks no. 12.

Among ASEAN countries continuous growth in employment in Japan is seen in workers from Vietnam, Indonesia and Myanmar. Among South Asian countries Nepal ranks much above us with 233,043 people whereas Sri Lanka had been successful with only 63,472 people.

Why Sri Lanka is less successful?

Many Sri Lankan workers find it difficult to secure positions through online recruitment methods or by prospective employer interviews due to the following reasons that adds on to a simple phrase “less likeable workforce”.

1. Language barrier in spite of having passed preliminary stages of Japanese examinations. The Japanese language can be challenging for non-native speakers. Communication difficulties can arise in employment settings, making it essential to learn at least basic Japanese to navigate daily life and work interactions. Many language teaching institutions/Japanese teachers in Sri Lanka tend to choose the path of least resistance to teach the language. Only few recognised institutions such as the Japanese Language Education Association of JASTECA make a concentrated effort to teach the language in a professional manner. Apart from the praiseworthy national TV program of 80 lessons, named “Yokoso Nihon e” (Welcome to Japan) sponsored by a generous well-wisher and coordinated by Japanese Graduates Alumni Association of Sri Lanka, no focused attention have been given by the authorities to give support to these prospective employees to Japan.

2. One of the major shortcomings Sri Lankans have is the lack of understanding of Japanese culture. Japan has distinct cultural norms, customs, and workplace etiquette. Adapting to these cultural differences can be a challenge for Sri Lankans unless a proper training and exposure are given to them beforehand, before leaving for Japan. Having the language and skillset is only one part of the requirement. A deep understanding of cultural values that prevail in Japan is a vital requirement to be successful in seeking employment in Japan or continuing successfully in employment in Japan.

3. Misunderstanding on work culture: Japanese work culture is known for its long hours, hierarchical structure, and emphasis on group harmony and consensus. Some Sri Lankans may find it challenging to adjust to the intense work environment and the pressure to conform.

4. Lack of mutual respect: This is another area some Sri Lankans fail in Japan. Reciprocating the Japanese people when they treat us with dignity and recognising their value is something every Sri Lankan seeking employment in Japan needs to bear in mind. Noisy behaviour when travelling in trains, lack of street ethics and loud voices have created a displeasure for some Sri Lankans in Japan, which in turn had resulted in less preference for Sri Lankans in comparison to Vietnamese, Nepalese and Burmese.

“Opportunity of a lifetime needs to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity”

It is heartening to note that Nepal and Myanmar with a much lower literacy rates than Sri Lanka have been quite successful in teaching the Japanese Language, instilling the proper cultural values, developing skills and securing more lucrative employment opportunities for their workers whilst our authorities have been sitting on the bandwagon being inactive or been least responsive to this new opportunity that exists in Japan. It is time that we realise that Japan has a huge problem to find labour to continue their production, run their establishments and to look after their elderly population. This is a great opportunity for us.

Dream of an FTA with Japan

If we are able to get our act together and create the right learning and training institutions that give the proper work knowledge, language proficiency and cultural training to our workforce like in Vietnam and Nepal we are able to send a “likeable workforce” to Japan. Then we can also start to talk about an FTA with Japan adding value to more trade taking place with Japan on account of vehicle imports. With a dagger hanging on our apparel exports with the new US tariff enforcements this may lead to a win/win proposition for Japan as well as our small country.
