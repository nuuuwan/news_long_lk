The role of print and digital media in the translation of political discourse is crucial in shaping public perception and influencing socio-political dynamics

Sri Lanka is a country where language has always been intertwined with politics. Language played a crucial role in the origination and continuation of the 30-year ethnic conflict on the island. Sinhalese was offered the official language status through the Official Language Act, No. 33 of 1956 and Tamil was granted the official language status through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987. The constitution recognises English as the link language, specifically for inter-ethnic communication. Even though Sinhalese and Tamil are recognised as official languages, the linguistic boundaries created by them are deeply entrenched in the socio-political fabric of Sri Lanka.

The rendering of political texts, ideologies, and discourse from one language to another cannot be considered a mere linguistic act since it is an ideological and strategic action. The translation of political discourse could influence public perception, fuel narratives and even create national debates. Translation, in that sense, could not be recognised as a neutral act since it has the power to clarify or obscure, unify or divide, empower or marginalise.

Political speeches, election manifestos, political statements, political news reports, etc. could shape public opinion, and the translation/interpretation of these might carry subtle differences in tone, emphasis, and representation, which will ultimately be interpreted in varied ways by different communities, resulting in mistrust and escalated tensions.

The role of print and digital media in the translation of political discourse is crucial in shaping public perception and influencing socio-political dynamics. Media agencies mediate political translations in ways that reinforce or challenge dominant narratives due to their ideological leanings and audience expectations. In a multilingual setting such as Sri Lanka, the same political speech or statement might be translated differently across Sinhalese, Tamil and English which will lead to varied interpretations and reactions among different linguistics communities. Digital media, specifically with the rapid dissemination of information and user-generated content could further complicate this process since translations could be selectively framed, edited, misinterpreted or deliberately manipulated to serve political agendas.

Translation of politics in Sri Lanka, with reference to the historical tensions, influences everything from policy interpretation to the formation of public opinions. Mitigating biases, cultural awareness, neutrality and accuracy in political translation require systematic efforts. Encouraging accurate multilingual journalism and fostering dialogue between the linguistic communities could contribute to an informed and inclusive political landscape in Sri Lanka.
