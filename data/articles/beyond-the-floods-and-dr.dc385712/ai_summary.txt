1. 🌏 Sri Lanka, a climate change hotspot, ranks 30th out of 180 countries in terms of vulnerability to natural disasters, according to Climate Risk Index 2021.
2. 🌧️💸 The nation suffers an average loss of LKR 50 billion (US$313 million) every year due to floods, cyclones, droughts, and landslides. This is roughly 0.4% of GDP or 2.1% of government expenditure.
3. 🌳🌦️ Historical records show that ancient Sri Lanka had considerably fewer natural disasters, thanks to sustainable land-use systems and human settlements, which helped conserve tree canopies and topsoil layers.
4. 💔🌲 British colonial intervention in Sri Lanka led to indiscriminate clearance of rain forests, infrastructure implementation in sensitive areas, and large scale settlements, significantly damaging environmentally sensitive areas.
5. 🚨🌍 Climate change aggravates the situation in Sri Lanka with increased rainfall in wet areas, prolonged droughts in dry zones, and rising sea levels in low-lying coastal areas.
6. 📝🏞️ National Physical Plan 2011, amended in 2019 and 2023, aims to conserve environmentally sensitive areas and limit developments in specific dry zones. However, actual implementation has been limited.
7. 🌳💧 Dr. P.A.K. Karunananda proposes a macro-level intervention plan to strengthen rainwater retention capacity in wet zones and divert water from wet zones to dry zones.
8. 💻👷 The proposed program would create jobs, particularly in the construction industry, which contributes 9% to the GDP, directly employing about 600,000 people.
9. 💰🏗️ A focus on this project could help concentrate financial resources from multinational donor funds towards national economic growth, as well as addressing climate change impacts and boosting food production.
10. 🚧🌱 The proposed projects include reforestation, construction of stormwater retention reservoirs, regeneration of tea plantations, and development of new settlements and infrastructure. This will involve key national institutions like various Ministries and Development Authorities.
