Facts:
- Ex-Foreign Secretary of Sri Lanka, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, stated twelve years ago that Sri Lanka was operating under the Rule of Men, rather than the Rule of Law.
- Palihakkara argued that this kind of system allows for impunity, threatens democracy, and undermines investment.
- Sri Lankaâ€™s performance on the Rule of Law Index, compiled by the World Justice Project, has been consistently poor, with a 2023 ranking of 77 out of 100.
- The Rule of Law Index assesses eight factors: constraints on government power, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice.
- Implications of a lack of Rule of Law include a negative impact on economic development due to lack of protection for property rights and blocked freedom of thought and expression.
- Evidence suggests that Sri Lanka has been using regulations selectively to favor those in the government and penalize those who oppose it.
