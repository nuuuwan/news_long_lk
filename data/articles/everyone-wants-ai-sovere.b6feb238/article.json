    "Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in \u201csovereign AI,\u201d with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0 But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0  If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.\u00a0 Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls",
    "A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions, driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. That figure rises to 80% in Denmark and 72% in Germany. The European Union has appointed its first Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty.\u00a0 This year, $475 billion is flowing into AI data centers globally. In the United States, AI data centers accounted for roughly one-fifth of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025. But the obstacle for other nations hoping to follow suit isn\u2019t just money. It\u2019s energy and physics. Global data center capacity is projected to hit 130 gigawatts by 2030, and for every $1 billion spent on these facilities, $125 million is needed for electricity networks. More than $750 billion in planned investment is already facing grid delays.",
    "And it\u2019s also talent. Researchers and entrepreneurs are mobile, drawn to ecosystems with access to capital, competitive wages, and rapid innovation cycles. Infrastructure alone won\u2019t attract or retain world-class talent.\u00a0\u00a0 What works: An orchestrated sovereignty What nations need isn\u2019t sovereignty through isolation but through specialization and orchestration. This means choosing which capabilities you build, which you pursue through partnership, and where you can genuinely lead in shaping the global AI landscape.\u00a0 The most successful AI strategies don\u2019t try to replicate Silicon Valley; they identify specific advantages and build partnerships around them.\u00a0  Singapore offers a model. Rather than seeking to duplicate massive infrastructure, it invested in governance frameworks, digital-identity platforms, and applications of AI in logistics and finance, areas where it can realistically compete.\u00a0 Israel shows a different path. Its strength lies in a dense network of startups and military-adjacent research institutions delivering outsize influence despite the country\u2019s small size.\u00a0 South Korea is instructive too. While it has national champions like Samsung and Naver, these firms still partner with Microsoft and Nvidia on infrastructure. That\u2019s deliberate collaboration reflecting strategic oversight, not dependence.\u00a0\u00a0 Even China, despite its scale and ambition, cannot secure full-stack autonomy. Its reliance on global research networks and on foreign lithography equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet systems needed to manufacture advanced chips and GPU architectures, shows the limits of techno-nationalism.",
    "The pattern is clear: Nations that specialize and partner strategically can outperform those trying to do everything alone.\u00a0 Three ways to align ambition with reality\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Measure added value, not inputs.\u00a0\u00a0 Sovereignty isn\u2019t how many petaflops you own. It\u2019s how many lives you improve and how fast the economy grows. Real sovereignty is the ability to innovate in support of national priorities such as productivity, resilience, and sustainability while maintaining freedom to shape governance and standards.\u00a0\u00a0  Nations should track the use of AI in health care and monitor how the technology\u2019s adoption correlates with manufacturing productivity, patent citations, and international research collaborations. The goal is to ensure that AI ecosystems generate inclusive and lasting economic and social value.\u00a0\u00a0 2. Cultivate a strong AI innovation ecosystem.\u00a0 Build infrastructure, but also build the ecosystem around it: research institutions, technical education, entrepreneurship support, and public-private talent development. Infrastructure without skilled talent and vibrant networks cannot deliver a lasting competitive advantage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. Build global partnerships.",
    "Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore\u2019s work with global cloud providers and the EU\u2019s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.\u00a0\u00a0 What\u2019s at stake",
    "Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.\u00a0 The cost of getting this wrong isn\u2019t just wasted capital\u2014it\u2019s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday\u2019s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.\u00a0 The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership\u2014choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it\u2019s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.\u00a0 The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies\u2014ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won\u2019t just participate in the AI economy; they\u2019ll shape it. That\u2019s sovereignty worth pursuing.\u00a0 Cathy Li is head of the Centre for AI Excellence at the World Economic Forum.  hide"
