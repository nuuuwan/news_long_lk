    "One day this fall, I watched an electronic sign outside the Broadway-Lafayette subway station in Manhattan switch seamlessly between an ad for makeup and one promoting the website Pickyourbaby.com, which promises a way for potential parents to use genetic tests to influence their baby\u2019s traits, including eye color, hair color, and IQ. Inside the station, every surface was wrapped with more of its ads\u2014babies on turnstiles, on staircases, on banners overhead. \u201cThink about it. Makeup and then genetic optimization,\u201d exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads. To his mind, one should be as accessible as the other.\u00a0  Nucleus is a young, attention-seeking genetic software company that says it can analyze genetic tests on IVF embryos to score them for 2,000 traits and disease risks, letting parents pick some and reject others. This is possible because of how our DNA shapes us, sometimes powerfully. As one of the subway banners reminded the New York riders: \u201cHeight is 80% genetic.\u201d Related StoryWe\u2019re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodiesRead next The day after the campaign launched, Sadeghi and I had briefly sparred online. He\u2019d been on X showing off a phone app where parents can click through traits like eye color and hair color. I snapped back that all this sounded a lot like Uber Eats\u2014another crappy, frictionless future invented by entrepreneurs, but this time you\u2019d click for a baby.",
    "I agreed to meet Sadeghi that night in the station under a banner that read, \u201cIQ is 50% genetic.\u201d He appeared in a puffer jacket and told me the campaign would soon spread to 1,000 train cars. Not long ago, this was a secretive technology to whisper about at Silicon Valley dinner parties. But now? \u201cLook at the stairs. The entire subway is genetic optimization. We\u2019re bringing it mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, like, we are normalizing it, right?\u201d Normalizing what, exactly? The ability to choose embryos on the basis of predicted traits could lead to healthier people. But the traits mentioned in the subway\u2014height and IQ\u2014focus the public\u2019s mind toward cosmetic choices and even naked discrimination. \u201cI think people are going to read this and start realizing: Wow, it is now an option that I can pick. I can have a taller, smarter, healthier baby,\u201d says Sadeghi.",
    "Entrepreneur Kian Sadeghi stands under advertising banner in the Broadway-Lafayette subway station in Manhattan, part of a campaign called \"Have Your Best Baby.\"COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR   Nucleus got its seed funding from Founders Fund, an investment firm known for its love of contrarian bets. And embryo scoring fits right in\u2014it\u2019s an unpopular concept, and professional groups say the genetic predictions aren\u2019t reliable. So far, leading IVF clinics still refuse to offer these tests. Doctors worry, among other things, that they\u2019ll create unrealistic parental expectations. What if little Johnny doesn\u2019t do as well on the SAT as his embryo score predicted? The ad blitz is a way to end-run such gatekeepers: If a clinic won\u2019t agree to order the test, would-be parents can take their business elsewhere. Another embryo testing company, Orchid, notes that high consumer demand emboldened Uber\u2019s early incursions into regulated taxi markets. \u201cDoctors are essentially being shoved in the direction of using it, not because they want to, but because they will lose patients if they don\u2019t,\u201d Orchid founder Noor Siddiqui said during an online event this past August.

Sadeghi prefers to compare his startup to Airbnb. He hopes it can link customers to clinics, becoming a digital \u201cfunnel\u201d offering a \u201cbetter experience\u201d for everyone. He notes that Nucleus ads don\u2019t mention DNA or any details of how the scoring technique works. That\u2019s not the point. In advertising, you sell the sizzle, not the steak. And in Nucleus\u2019s ad copy, what sizzles is height, smarts, and light-colored eyes. Related StoryThe race to make the perfect baby is creating an ethical messRead nextIt makes you wonder if the ads should be permitted. Indeed, I learned from Sadeghi that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had objected to parts of the campaign. The metro agency, for instance, did not let Nucleus run ads saying \u201cHave a girl\u201d and \u201cHave a boy,\u201d even though it\u2019s very easy to identify the sex of an embryo using a genetic test. The reason was an MTA policy that forbids using government-owned infrastructure to promote \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d against protected classes, which include race, religion and biological sex. Since 2023, New York City has also included height and weight in its anti-discrimination law, the idea being to \u201croot out bias\u201d related to body size in housing and in public spaces. So I\u2019m not sure why the MTA let Nucleus declare that height is 80% genetic. (The MTA advertising department didn\u2019t respond to questions.) Perhaps it\u2019s because the statement is a factual claim, not an explicit call to action. But we all know what to do: Pick the tall one and leave shorty in the IVF freezer, never to be born.
