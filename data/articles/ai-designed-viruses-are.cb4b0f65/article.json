    "Artificial intelligence can draw cat pictures and write emails. Now the same technology can compose a working genome. A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses\u2014and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.  The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the \u201cthe first generative design of complete genomes.\u201d The work, described in a preprint paper, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an \u201cimpressive first step\u201d toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by MIT Technology Review.",
    "Boeke says the AI\u2019s performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. \u201cThey saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,\u201d he says. This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That\u2019s because viruses are not alive. They\u2019re more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes.",
    "Related StoryAI is dreaming up drugs that no one has ever seen. Now we\u2019ve got to see if they work.AI automation throughout the drug development pipeline is opening up the possibility of faster, cheaper pharmaceuticals.",
    "In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage\u2014a virus that infects bacteria\u2014called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters. To do so, they used two versions of an AI called Evo, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses. But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with E. coli bacteria. That led to a profound \u201cAI is here\u201d moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.  \u201cThat was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,\u201d says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out. Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working\u2014that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them. J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first organisms with lab-made DNA nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like \u201cjust a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.\u201d For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. \u201cWe did the manual AI version\u2014combing through the literature, taking what was known,\u201d he says.",
    "But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024 for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence. Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses. For instance, doctors have sometimes tried \u201cphage therapy\u201d to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria. \u201cThere is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,\u201d says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei\u2019s lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients\u2019 bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones. The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven\u2019t taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists\u2014out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice\u2014could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality. \u201cOne area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it\u2019s random so you don\u2019t know what you are getting,\u201d says Venter. \u201cIf someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.\u201d Whether an AI can generate a bona fide genome for a larger organism remains an open question. For instance, E. coli has about a thousand times more DNA code than phiX174 does.\u00a0\u201cThe complexity would rocket from staggering to \u2026 way way more than the number of subatomic particles in the universe,\u201d says Boeke. Also, there\u2019s still no easy way to test AI designs for larger genomes. While some viruses can \u201cboot up\u201d from just a DNA strand, that\u2019s not the case with a bacterium, a mammoth, or a human. Scientists would instead have to gradually change an existing cell with genetic engineering\u2014a still laborious process. Despite that, Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, a cell-engineering company in Boston, says exactly such an effort is needed. He believes it could be carried out in \u201cautomated\u201d laboratories where genomes get proposed and tested and the results are fed back to AI for further improvement. \u00a0\u201cThis would be a nation-scale scientific milestone, as cells are the building blocks of all life,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe US should make sure we get to it first.\u201d hide"
