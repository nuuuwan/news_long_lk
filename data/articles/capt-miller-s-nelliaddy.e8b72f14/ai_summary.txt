- 🐯 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam's (LTTE) narrated the story of Vallipuram Vasanthan, also known as Captain Miller, as their first suicide bomber. 
- 💥 This followed the Sri Lankan Armed Forces taking control of the Vadamaratchy sector in Northern Jaffna from the LTTE in 1987.
- 🇮🇳 Political intervention stopped the Army from advancing further; humanitarian operation "Operation Poomaalai" was launched by India to airdrop food supplies across Jaffna. This signaled to Colombo to cease all military operations. 
- 👥 The LTTE planned an attack on the Army camp at Nelliaddy to regain confidence lost from the public after the fall of Vadamaratchy.
- 🚛 Two trucks filled with explosives were to be driven into the Army camp, and were prefaced by the removal of roadblocks and speed breakers on the camp roads.
- ❗Unexpected gunfire resulted in the second truck toppling over before it could reach the camp and resulted in a less effective explosion.
- 💣 The final attack led to a combat where Kamal, the lead attacker, fell dead and Miller’s body was completely blown up. 
- ⚰️ Miller, promoted posthumously as Captain alongside Kamal as Major, was eluded by the LTTE as a hero that instilled a new confidence in them.
- 📘 LTTE drew the blueprint for future "Black Tigers" or suicide bombers, and Prabhakaran later developed this concept which he deemed a 'Uyiraayutham' or 'live weapon'.   
- ⏭️ The suicide killers came to play a crucial role in the ongoing conflict between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan state, although what motivated them remained a puzzle in the lack of religious fanaticism.
