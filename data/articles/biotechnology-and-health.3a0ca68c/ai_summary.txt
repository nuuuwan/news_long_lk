Robotic companions, such as the Golden Pup and Paro the baby seal, are being developed to assist individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. These robots can interact with their owners, can respond to touch and sound, and some can even develop character over time. More advanced devices, which leverage AI to converse and play games are being developed and tested by researchers from Indiana University Bloomington. While there are concerns over privacy and social responsibilities, there are also many advantages. Robots don't tire or get stressed. With dementia cases growing, it's predicted that society will need more than a million additional care workers by 2031. Robots, while not a replacement for human interaction, could help make up some of this shortfall and provide some much-needed companionship.
