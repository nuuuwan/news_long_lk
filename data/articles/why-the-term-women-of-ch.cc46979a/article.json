Regular Checkup readers might already know some of mine, which include the quest to delay or reverse human aging, and new technologies for reproductive health and fertility. So when I saw trailers for The Substance, a film centered on one middle-aged woman\u2019s attempt to reexperience youth, I had to watch it.  I won\u2019t spoil the movie for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it yet (although I should warn that it is not for the squeamish, or anyone with an aversion to gratuitous close-ups of bums and nipples). But a key premise of the film involves harmful attitudes toward female aging.

    "\u201cHey, did you know that a woman\u2019s fertility starts to decrease by the age of 25?\u201d a powerful male character asks early in the film. \u201cAt 50, it just stops,\u201d he later adds. He never explains what stops, exactly, but to the viewer the message is pretty clear: If you\u2019re a woman, your worth is tied to your fertility. Once your fertile window is over, so are you.",
    "The insidious idea that women\u2019s bodies are, above all else, vessels for growing children has plenty of negative consequences for us all. But it has also set back scientific research and health policy. Earlier this week, I chatted about this with Alana Cattapan, a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Cattapan has been exploring the concept of \u201cwomen of reproductive age\u201d\u2014a descriptor that is ubiquitous in health research and policy.",
    "The idea for the research project came to her when the Zika virus was making headlines around eight years ago. \u201cI was planning on going to the Caribbean for a trip related to my partner\u2019s research, and I kept getting advice that women of reproductive age shouldn\u2019t go,\u201d she told me. At the time, Zika was being linked to microcephaly\u2014unusually small heads\u2014in newborn babies. It was thought that the virus was affecting key stages of fetal development. Cattapan wasn\u2019t pregnant. And she wasn\u2019t planning on becoming pregnant at the time. So why was she being advised to stay away from areas with the virus? The experience got her thinking about the ways in which attitudes toward our bodies are governed by the idea of potential pregnancy. Take, for example, biomedical research on the causes and treatment of disease. Women\u2019s health has lagged behind men\u2019s as a focus of such work, for multiple reasons. Male bodies have long been considered the \u201cdefault\u201d human form, for example. And clinical trials have historically been designed in ways that make them less accessible for women. Fears about the potential effects of drugs on fetuses have also played a significant role in keeping people who have the potential to become pregnant out of studies. \u201cScientific research has excluded women of \u2018reproductive age,\u2019 or women who might potentially conceive, in a blanket way,\u201d says Cattapan. \u201cThe research that we have on many, many drugs does not include women and certainly doesn\u2019t include women in pregnancy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryWhat\u2019s next for reproductive rights in the USSeven states are set to implement laws supporting abortion access, but the future of reproductive rights in the US is unclear.",
    "This lack of research goes some way to explaining why women are much more likely to experience side effects from drugs\u2014some of them fatal. Over the last couple of decades, greater effort has been made to include people with ovaries and uteruses in clinical research. But we still have a long way to go. Women are also often subjected to medical advice designed to protect a potential fetus, whether they are pregnant or not. Official guidelines on how much mercury-containing fish it is safe to eat can be different for \u201cwomen of childbearing age,\u201d according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, for example.\u00a0 And in 2021, the World Health Organization used the same language to describe people who should be a focus of policies to reduce alcohol consumption.\u00a0 The takeaway message is that it\u2019s women who should be thinking about fetal health, says Cattapan. Not the industries producing these chemicals or the agencies that regulate them. Not even the men who contribute to a pregnancy. Just women who stand a chance of getting pregnant, whether they intend to or not. \u201cIt puts the onus of the health of future generations squarely on the shoulders of women,\u201d she says. Another problem is the language itself. The term \u201cwomen of reproductive age\u201d typically includes women between 15 and 44. Women at one end of that spectrum will have very different bodies and a very different set of health risks from those at the other. And the term doesn\u2019t account for people who might be able to get pregnant but don\u2019t necessarily identify as female.",
    "In other cases it is overly broad. In the context of the Zika virus, for example, it was not all women between the ages of 15 and 44 who should have considered taking precautions. The travel advice didn\u2019t apply to people who\u2019d had hysterectomies or did not have sex with men, for example, says Cattapan. \u201cPrecision here matters,\u201d she says.\u00a0 More nuanced health advice would be helpful in cases like these. Guidelines often read as though they\u2019re written for people assumed to be stupid, she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t think that needs to be the case.\u201d Another thing On Thursday, president-elect Donald Trump said that he will nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. The news was not entirely a surprise, given that Trump had told an audience at a campaign rally that he would let Kennedy \u201cgo wild\u201d on health, \u201cthe foods,\u201d and \u201cthe medicines.\u201d The role would give Kennedy some control over multiple agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates medicines in the US, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which coordinates public health advice and programs.  That\u2019s extremely concerning to scientists, doctors, and health researchers, given Kennedy\u2019s positions on evidence-based medicine, including his antivaccine stance. A few weeks ago, in a post on X, he referred to the FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can\u2019t be patented by Pharma.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you,\u201d continued the post. \u201c1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags.\u201d There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. But briefly, we don\u2019t yet have good evidence that mind-altering psychedelic drugs are the mental-health cure-alls some claim they are. There\u2019s not enough evidence to support the many unapproved stem-cell treatments sold by clinics throughout the US and beyond, either. These \u201ctreatments\u201d can be dangerous. Health agencies are currently warning against the consumption of raw unpasteurized milk, because it might carry the bird flu virus that has been circulating in US dairy farms. And it\u2019s far too simplistic to lump all vitamins together\u2014some might be of benefit to some people, but not everyone needs supplements, and high doses can be harmful.",
