    "Wijeweera (in glasses) in 1970",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no sorrier sight than an unpopular populist\u201d goes the old political science joke. As an old political scientist, I\u2019d say that\u2019s even truer of an unpopular \u201cleft populist\u201d.",
    "The Deep South, \u2018Ruhuna\u2019 is the JVP\u2019s cradle. You can hardly get deeper south than Angunakolapelessa in Tangalle, Hambantota district, rice-growing territory. On the day that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake flew to Beijing, oddly enough without Industries Minister Sunil Handunetti, the NPP lost the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society (MPCS) election in Angunakolapelessa to a coalition of SLPP and SJB elements and Mahinda Amaraweera\u2019s supporters.",
    "The NPP also lost a second the MPCS election in the South: Welivitiya-Divithura, Karandeniya, Galle District. That too was to a coalition of the SLPP, SJB and SLFP. In more urbanised Kelaniya, the SJB resoundingly beat the NPP at the MPCS election.",
    "MPCS elections have always been the early warnings and symptoms of electoral standing.",
    "Never has a Sri Lankan administration, especially one which swept the board recently, begun to lose elections so speedily at the grassroots, in diverse locations. What\u2019s going wrong?",
    "1. In their ineffable arrogance, Anura and the JVP-NPP spurned a united front under their leadership with dissident progressive political elements from former administrations. Therefore, they don\u2019t have experienced personalities who know good, workable policies from bad ones; how the system works and how to work it; are familiar with processes and capable of skilfully guiding the machinery of state.",
    "2. The JVP-NPP and its supportive intelligentsia hardly contain the best policy brains in the country. A Left-led united front could have mobilised such elements, as in the Left coalition Government of Kerala.",
    "3. Consequently, AKD and the JVP-NPP neither have good, viable policies nor know how to deliver. In some basic respects (e.g., rice-coconut-salt) they compare unfavourably with their predecessors.",
    "4. AKD-NPP swerved hard to the right on economic policy, implementing what they didn\u2019t promise and the opposite of what they did promise.",
    "5. NPP behaviour has been semi-authoritarian, and discourse, insensitive and imperious (e.g., Bimal\u2019s supercilious sneering, Nalinda\u2019s diatribe against Dullas, Harini sterner than Sirimavo).",
    "The NPP\u2019s triple defeats at the MPCS elections prove that the most viable Opposition strategy is of broad, flexible, cross-party, politically pluralist alliances, ranging from Sajith\u2019s SJB to Namal\u2019s SLPP and everything in-between.",
    "Instead of peddling \u2018SJB-UNP unity\u2019, the effort in this 90th anniversary year of the legendary Popular Front (1935), must be to creatively construct the broadest, most inclusive, ideology-transcending, multipolar bloc/platform of the Opposition\u2014a \u2018domestic BRICS\u2019.",
    "Forget as national alternatives, Dilith Jayaweera and Champika Ranawaka, former comrades and two sides of the same coin. Also, Sarath Fonseka. AKD leads the JVP, a mainstream party with a long narrative history. Dilith and Champika may see themselves as Trump, Modi, or Netanyahu but those politicians are leaders of pre-eminent national parties: US Republicans, BJP, Likud. Dilith and Champika are strictly sect/cult-scale.",
    "As the MPCS election results show, Sajith and Namal in whichever order will always be bigger players.",
    "Because of their high-value, rolling public education activity on national policy, so too will the extra-parliamentary FSP-PSA.",
    "Handunetti\u2019s China absence",
    "Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake\u2019s Minister of Industries (1965-1970), Philip Gunawardena built Ceylon\u2019s heavy industries by securing support from the socialist states. Philip, \u2018the father of Ceylon\u2019s Marxist movement\u2019, was not an old comrade of liberal-democrat Dudley.",
    "President Anura Dissanayake\u2019s old comrade Sunil Handunetti, Minister of Industries, did not accompany AKD on his first visit as head of state to China, the chief potential source of investment for any serious, speedy program of industrialisation which is the only way to expand our exports and earn our exit from the debt trap (Howard Nicholas, Shiran Illanperuma).",
    "As Chairman COPE and (later) co-host of Mawatha, the widely-watched TV show on economic issues, Handunetti\u2019s role was hugely helpful to the JVP-NPP and AKD.",
    "Deepfake \u2018end-of-crisis\u2019",
    "It is one thing to express satisfaction over the stabilisation that has been achieved. It is quite another to claim as Central Bank Tsar Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe does, that the crisis is in the rear-view mirror.",
    "\u201c\u2026Speaking at the launch of the CBSL\u2019s Policy Agenda for 2025 and Beyond, Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe emphasised that Sri Lanka has made a significant recovery after enduring its worst economic crisis in history\u2026\u201d (https://www.ft.lk/top-story/Sri-Lanka-stands-stronger-reforms-key-for-future-success-CBSL-Chief/26-771615)",
    "\u201c\u2026As Sri Lanka has managed to brave through what was the worst economic crisis faced in history and moving towards normalcy, the island nation\u2019s financial sector regulator yesterday said that its focus this year would be on achieving a \u201ctransformative acceleration\u201d in the growth trajectory.\u201d",
    "(https://www.dailymirror.lk/business-main/Sri-Lanka-aims-for-transformative-acceleration-in-post-crisis-growth/245-299746)",
    "Dr. Weerasinghe strikes a particularly Gotabayaesque note of \u201cwe did it the best of all\u201d which flies in the face of the evidence that several other countries have secured much better terms of debt restructuring than Sri Lanka has.",
    "\u201c\u2026He stressed that notwithstanding Sri Lanka\u2019s faster-than-expected recovery compared to other countries that faced similar situations\u2026\u201d (Ibid)",
    "The masterclass in deconstructing AKD\u2019s debt deal was the Kegalle lecture by the Educational Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party who formerly held the same post in the JVP, Pubudu Jayagoda, civil engineer and member of the People\u2019s Struggle Alliance (PSA). (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0QYL5gn3Y0)",
    "AKD\u2019s debt deal hasn\u2019t kicked the can of repayment down the road to 2028. Nandalal Weerasinghe confirms Dhanusha Pathirana\u2019s counterview that repayment starts in 2025 and amounts to a whopping US $ 5 billion this year.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka is building its foreign reserves to cover its debt obligations of $ 5 billion for the next 12 months, as foreign inflows in 2025 will create a healthy liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201c\u2026our obligation is $ 5 billion for the next 12 months. If we had $ 10 billion, sufficient cover for the next two years, we would have sufficient cover,\u201d he told Central Banking.\u2019",
    "Nandalal Weerasinghe\u2019s remarks prove that:",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s debt obligation is $5 billion in the next 12 months.",
    "The figure of $10 billion reserves is purely aspirational.",
    "Sri Lanka does not actually have the reserves to safely absorb the outflow of $ 5 billion.",
    "It\u2019s the debt trap, stupid",
    "We are not out of the crisis nor have we headed towards the exit ramp. We have simply moved from one stage of the crisis (default) to another (unconscionably excessive repayment).",
    "Mahinda Rajapaksa was the first to resort to ISBs but repaid that debt in full (as Pubudu Jayagoda concedes). Thus, the debt crisis is just over five years old, beginning with the ISB surge in the last days of the hybrid Yahapalanaya administration (2015-2019) in which Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP \u2013 which included today\u2019s SJB economists--ran economic and financial policy. That ISB surge is still defended by the SJB. The debt crisis encompasses the Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe presidencies and now the Anura Dissanayake presidency.",
    "President Dissanayake could have bought himself time and space by constituting a blue-ribbon panel of the top Sri Lankan economists here and abroad, supported by a scaffolding of renowned international economists sympathetic to Sri Lanka on the debt issue, to scrutinise the terms of the Ranil-bondholder \u2018agreement in principle\u2019 of August-September 2024 and provide within a compressed time-frame, perhaps as the outcome of a week\u2019s conference in Colombo, a menu of options and a roadmap. Anura chose NOT to do that, and to sign-off instead on Ranil\u2019s debt deal-- the economic equivalent of the latter\u2019s treacherous CFA with Prabhakaran.",
    "The current crisis is the combination of an inherited, 5-year-old debt crisis plus the consequences of Ranil\u2019s bad agreement which Anura is implementing when he could have deferred or partially deflected it.",
    "A single, axial, debt crisis running from at least 2019 to now and through to 2030 and beyond, has serious implications.",
    "Given the continuity of the economic crisis with the debt crisis at its core, the same structural factors and dynamics that underlay the administrations since 2019 also underlie the Anura Dissanayake administration.",
    "Though the political leadership and the government have changed, the underlying reality of the crisis hasn\u2019t, and that reality being a larger determinant than the Governmental change, we are still living in the same period of history; a period bearing the same character or nature.",
    "President Dissanayake didn\u2019t even attempt a revisionist or reformist approach towards the ISB-IMF framework inherited from Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s debt repayment crisis will be hugely compounded by the shocks to the international economic and political order that will be dealt by the Trump administration. The national crisis will be compounded by the international crisis.",
    "The incoming Trump administration\u2019s attempt to reverse the end of America\u2019s unipolar hegemony will result in a period of disruption, conflicts and resistance. Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis of the disastrous debt deal and the downstream effects of its working-out will be overlaid, reinforced and intensified by the disruptive global dynamics. This fusion of international volatility and the drain on Sri Lanka through unfair debt-repayment, will make our country one of the \u2018weakest links\u2019 in the chain of the world economy.",
    "We remain in an uninterrupted \u201ccrisis process\u201d which is open-ended. The economic crisis that triggered the Aragalaya has changed in its form but not its core content and will therefore manifest itself, not as the old Aragalaya, but in \u201ctwo, three, many, Aragalayas\u201d (if I may adapt Che Guevara\u2019s indelible phrase \u201ctwo, three, many Vietnams\u201d). I am not saying the Aragalaya will return. I am saying Aragalaya in a generic sense, will. Insofar as the debt crisis is unfinished, so too is the Aragalaya. If the crisis is a process, so also is the Aragalaya.",
    "SJB-UNP rapprochement?",
    "Several influentials in the SJB and UNP identify themselves as \u2018Centre-Right\u2019 or downright Right. They believe that when the masses reject the \u2018leftist\u2019 JVP-NPP, the swing will be to the Right/Centre-Right. All it takes is for the SJB and UNP to merge or partner, unifying the \u2018Right/Centre-Right\u2019.",
    "That\u2019s hollow, because:",
    "Today\u2019s UNPers and SJBers were one party till 2020\u2014everyone belonged to Ranil\u2019s UNP-- while it never was elected to the Presidency, was repeatedly defeated including as an incumbent party (Feb 2018), and shed its vote base. Why would re-convergence yield a different, better result?",
    "Despite Ranil\u2019s peak achievement --stabilising the economy--he lost the presidential election convincingly, not even coming second. Reappointed UNP leader for 6 more years, he remains electoral Kryptonite.",
    "Adding Sajith\u2019s 32.76% and Ranil\u2019s 17.27% in Sept 2024 is ridiculous because Ranil\u2019s was not mainly a UNP vote but a \u2018Gas Cylinder\u2019 SLPP-SLFP defector vote which no longer exists or won\u2019t return.",
    "In its victories against the centre-left (1965, 1977, 1988/9) the UNP never called itself \u2018rightwing\u2019 or even \u2018centre-right\u2019. Ask Imthiaz Bakeer Markar whose active UNP history dates back to 1972. It was Ranil\u2019s affiliation of the UNP with the IDU (global neoliberal/neocon Right) that distorted identity.",
    "An alliance with Ranil\u2019s congenitally unelectable UNP cannot constitute a recipe for electoral success. It is a political oxymoron.",
    "SJB chairman Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, highly-respected across the political spectrum, has called for self-critical introspection and reform. (https://www.ft.lk/front-page/SJB-failed-to-create-a-political-force-people-can-trust-Chairman-Imthiaz-BakeerMarkar/44-771717). His two missives (12 points and 34 points) are an invaluable starting point, but don\u2019t address the intractable syndrome the SJB suffers from:",
    "The SJB is uncertain of its loyalties as between its own leader (Sajith) and former leader (Ranil) even after the latter sabotaged the former and ensured AKD\u2019s victory.",
    "The SJB was never sure whether its main identity was as the principal Opposition and its main goal was to win the upcoming election, or whether its main identity was as the agency of \u2018free-market\u2019 economic doctrine, and its main goal was to get the country to follow that economic ideology under whichever President (Harsha\u2019s line).",
    "The SJB is unsure whether AKD should be praised (Harsha) or condemned (Sajith) for dumping his election pledges and taking Ranil\u2019s road.",
    "The SJB doesn\u2019t know whether it is a progressive centrist party of social democracy (Sajith, Imthiaz) or a centre-right/rightwing party of economic liberalism (Harsha-Eran).",
    "2024 was President Premadasa\u2019s birth centenary year but the SJB failed to commemorate him though it would have boosted Sajith\u2019s campaign in election year. Premadasa\u2019s dramatically successful development doctrine was never imparted to the SJB. The party\u2019s economic ideologues remain wedded to the vote-killing economic doctrine of Ranil Wickremesinghe they imbibed under his overlong, conspicuously unsuccessful leadership.",
    "In 1970 a centre-left United Front with a powerful left component was elected to office with a 2/3rds majority. In 2024 a left-populist movement driven by a Marxist party shifted to the centre and won a 2/3rds majority. The 1970 Government deviated rightwards and the UNP crushed it at the 1977 General Election.",
    "The 2024 one has done likewise, pivoting more sharply rightwards-- the ISB sellout\u2014and adopting in an ultimate irony, the program of Ranil, son of Esmond Wickremesinghe, whose Shenoy-Suharto-Chicago Boys model triggered Wijeweera\u2019s arming of the JVP in the late-1960s.",
    "Left critiques of the 1970 UF government were of several types:",
    "Critical support from within by those (Wickramabahu, Vasu, Janavegaya Maoists) fearful of a break with the UF base; \u2018unity-and-struggle\u2019 constructive criticism from without, by those who demurred at rupture. Voters bypassed all vacillators in halfway-houses, embracing the Opposition UNP as the only clear-cut alternative.",
    "Frontal critiques from Trotskyists and Maoists \u2013 Bala Tampoe, N. Sanmugathasan--who had opposed the LSSP and CPSL shifts, national and international, to the right in 1964. Tamil-led, these had limited national traction.",
    "Breakout to the Opposition (1972) by CPSL icons SA Wickremesinghe and Sarath Muttetuwegama, supported by the ATHTHA newspaper. Soviet pressure restored party unity, disastrously-- the lesson being, never let anyone else\u2019s foreign policy be your domestic policy. Mao, Ho and Fidel never did.",
    "Radical \u2018New Left\u2019 critiques from Wijeweera\u2019s JVP and smaller organisations before and after the 1971 insurrection and its suppression.",
    "a. Wijeweera\u2019s JVP had maintained its left critique of the UF Government without being provoked into adventurist armed violence.",
    "b. The SA Wickremesinghe-Sarath Muttetuwegama wing of the CPSL (so-called \u2018hardliners\u2019) remained in the Opposition and evolved into the equivalent of Kerala\u2019s CPI-M.",
    "c. Vasudeva-Wickramabahu-Vama SamaSamaja had broken away in 1972-3.",
    "Any of these political options\u2014better still, a combination--may have achieved one of four outcomes:",
    "Repeat the 1953 Hartal uprising when mass economic hardship was acute from 1973 (e.g., the ban of rice transport) or take the 1976-1977 nationwide students\u2019 revolt-railway strike-General Strike to the next level.",
    "Compete with the UNP as Left alternative in 1977.",
    "Be the main Opposition in the 1977 Parliament.",
    "Form a strong Left Opposition in the 1977 Parliament.",
    "As a \u2018thought experiment\u2019, reprise Rohana Wijeweera\u2019s political and ideological line of the 1970s towards the UF government, MINUS the armed violence. That would have been the correct line then. That would be the correct line now.",
    "The 1970s prove that if the Left doesn\u2019t provide a clear alternative early enough to a Centre-Left government turned rightwards and economically hurting the people, the Right will succeed it. The Left has to seize the banner of anti-government struggle and lead it.",
