    "Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions. These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I\u2019m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn\u2019t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.  So let\u2019s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I\u2019ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity. How are the fuel needs for next-generation nuclear reactors different, and how are companies addressing the supply chain? Many next-generation reactors don\u2019t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.",
    "It\u2019s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it\u2019s below 5%.) HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn\u2019t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.",
    "That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted. The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there\u2019s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors. How is safety being addressed, and what\u2019s happening with nuclear safety regulation in the US? There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.) But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn\u2019t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.  A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public. I\u2019m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like \u2018rubber-stamping nuclear projects\u2019 are being said,\u201d Shirvan said during that event.\u00a0\u00a0 During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that\u2019s not inherent to the technology, and there\u2019s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s because of stringent regulatory oversight.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Are next-generation reactors going to be financially competitive? Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let\u2019s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.",
    "Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet\u2014Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I\u2019m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.) That number\u2019s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It\u2019s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate. The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced. So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren\u2019t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size. It\u2019ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we\u2019re likely going to see for years.) Today\u2019s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard. An important caveat: Capital cost isn\u2019t everything\u2014running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there\u2019s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones. Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don\u2019t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.
