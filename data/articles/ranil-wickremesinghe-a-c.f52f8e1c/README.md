With dignity, you took your stand,

Hon. President Ranil, for this land,

Through chaos, crisis, darkened skies,

You led with courage, calm, and wise.

A bankrupt nation in your care,

You rose when others did not dare.

Through turbulent seas, you steered the helm,

And brought peace to your beloved realm.

The “Vine Bridge” swayed beneath your feet,

Yet you carried Sri Lanka, steady and fleet.

From hunger’s grasp and sorrow’s gloom,

You gave her back her chance to bloom.

Inflation quelled, reserves restored,

The rupee strong, new hope outpoured.

From negative growth to rising gain,

You brought relief where there was pain.

And now, with grace, you step aside,

As tides of history shift and glide.

To Hon. Anura, you pass the flame,

A peaceful heart, without acclaim.

You served your people, true and right,

Guided them through darkest night.

Hon. President Ranil, your journey done,

Your legacy, forever, will shine like the sun.

With or without power, you vowed to stay,

In service of Sri Lanka, come what may.

Your love for this land, beyond all pride,

In the annals of time, it will never hide.

A leader’s role fulfilled with grace,

You leave behind a shining trace.

Hon. Ranil, though as President you depart,

You will live in the nation’s grateful heart.
