    "For decades, space stations have been largely staffed by professional astronauts and operated by a handful of nations. But that\u2019s about to change in the coming years, as companies including Axiom Space and Sierra Space launch commercial space stations that will host tourists and provide research facilities for nations and other firms.\u00a0 The first of those stations could be Haven-1, which the California-based company Vast aims to launch in May 2026. If all goes to plan, its earliest paying visitors will arrive about a month later. Drew Feustel, a former NASA astronaut, will help train them and get them up to speed ahead of their historic trip. Feustel has spent 226 days in space on three trips to the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.\u00a0  Feustel is now lead astronaut for Vast, which he advised on the new station\u2019s interior design. He also created a months-long program to prepare customers to live and work there. Crew members (up to four at a time) will arrive at Haven-1 via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will dock to the station and remain attached throughout each 10-day stay. (Vast hasn\u2019t publicly said who will fly on its first missions or announced the cost of a ticket, though competing firms have charged tens of millions of dollars for similar trips.)  In this artist's rendering, the Haven-1 space station is shown in orbit docked with the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.VAST   Haven-1 is intended as a temporary facility, to be followed by a bigger, permanent station called Haven-2. Vast will begin launching Haven-2\u2019s modules in 2028 and says it will be able to support a crew by 2030. That\u2019s about when NASA will start decommissioning the ISS, which has operated for almost 30 years. Instead of replacing it, NASA and its partners intend to carry out research aboard commercial stations like those built by Vast, Axiom, and Sierra.",
    "I recently caught up with Feustel in Lisbon at the tech conference Web Summit, where he was speaking about his role at Vast and the company\u2019s ambitions.\u00a0 Responses have been edited and condensed.",
    "What are you hoping this new wave of commercial space stations will enable people to do? Ideally, we\u2019re creating access. The paradigm that we\u2019ve seen for 25 years is primarily US-backed missions to the International Space Station, and [NASA] operating that station in coordination with other nations. But [it\u2019s] still limited to 16 or 17 primary partners in the ISS program.\u00a0 Following NASA\u2019s intentions, we are planning to become a service provider to not only the US government, but other sovereign nations around the world, to allow greater access to a low-Earth-orbit platform. We can be a service provider to other organizations and nations that are planning to build a human spaceflight program. Today, you\u2019re Vast\u2019s lead astronaut after you were initially brought on to advise the company on the design of Haven-1 and Haven-2. What are some of the things that you've weighed in on?\u00a0  Some of the things where I can see tangible evidence of my work is, for example, in the sleep cores and sleep system\u2014trying to define a more comfortable way for astronauts to sleep. We\u2019ve come up with an air bladder system that provides distributed forces on the body that kind of emulate, or I believe will emulate, the gravity field that we feel in bed when we lie down, having that pressure of gravity on you.\u00a0  Oh, like a weighted blanket?\u00a0 Kind of like a weighted blanket, but you\u2019re up against the wall, so you have to create, like, an inflatable bladder that will push you against the wall. That\u2019s one of the very tangible, obvious things. But I work with the company on anything from crew displays and interfaces and how notifications and system information come through to how big a window should be.\u00a0 How big should a window be? I feel like the bigger the better\u2014but what are the factors that go into that, from an astronaut\u2019s perspective?",
    "The bigger the better. And the other thing to think about is\u2014what do you do with the window? Take pictures. The ability to take photos out a window is important\u2014the quality of the window, which direction it points. You know, it\u2019s not great if it\u2019s just pointing up in space all the time and you never see the Earth.\u00a0  VAST   You\u2019re also in charge of the astronaut training program at Vast. Tell me what that program looks like, because in some cases you\u2019ll have private citizens who are paying for their trip that have no experience whatsoever. A typical training flow for two weeks on our space station is extended out to about an 11-month period with gaps in between each of the training weeks. And so if you were to press that down together, it probably represents about three to four months of day-to-day training.\u00a0 I would say half of it\u2019s devoted to learning how to fly on the SpaceX Dragon, because that\u2019s our transportation, and the greatest risk for anybody flying is on launch and landing. We want people to understand how to operate in that spacecraft, and that component is designed by SpaceX. They have their own training plans.\u00a0  What we do is kind of piggyback on those weeks. If a crew shows up in California to train at SpaceX, we\u2019ll grab them that same week and say, \u201cCome down to our facility. We will train you to operate inside our spacecraft.\u201d Much of that is focused on emergency response. We want the crew to be able to keep themselves safe. In case anything happens on the vehicle that requires them to depart, to get back in the SpaceX Dragon and leave, we want to make sure that they understand all of the steps required.\u00a0  Another part is day-to-day living, like\u2014how do you eat? How do you sleep, how do you use the bathroom? Those are really important things. How do you download the pictures after you take them? How do you access your science payloads that are in our payload racks that provide data and telemetry for the research you\u2019re doing?\u00a0 We want to practice every one of those things multiple times, including just taking care of yourself, before you go to space so that when you get there, you\u2019ve built a lot of that into your muscle memory, and you can just do the things you need to do instead of every day being like a really steep learning curve.  VAST     Strawberries and other perishable foods are freeze-dried by the Vast Food Systems team to prepare them for missions.  Making coffee in a zero-gravity environment calls for specialized devices.VAST   Do you have a facility where you\u2019ll take people through some of these motions? Or a virtual simulation of some kind?",
    "We have built a training mock-up, an identical vehicle to what people will live in in space. But it\u2019s not in a zero-gravity environment. The only way to get any similar training is to fly on what we call a zero-g airplane, which does parabolas in space\u2014it climbs up and then falls toward the Earth. Its nickname is the vomit comet.\u00a0 But otherwise, there\u2019s really no way to train for microgravity. You just have to watch videos and talk about it a lot, and try to prepare people mentally for what that\u2019s going to be like. You can also train underwater, but that\u2019s more related to spacewalking, and it\u2019s much more advanced.",
    "How do you expect people will spend their time in the station?\u00a0 If history is any indication, they will be quite busy and probably oversubscribed. Their time will be spent basically caring for themselves, and trying to execute their experiments, and looking out the window. Those are the three big categories of what you\u2019re going to do in space. And public relation activities like outreach back to Earth, to schools or hospitals or corporations.\u00a0  This new era means that many more everyday people\u2014though mostly wealthy ones at the beginning, because of ticket prices\u2014will have this interesting view of Earth. How do you think the average person will react to that?\u00a0 A good analogy is to say, how are people reacting to sub-orbital flights? Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic offer suborbital flights, [which are] basically three or four minutes of floating and looking down at the Earth from an altitude that\u2019s about a third or a fifth of the altitude that actual orbital and career astronauts achieve when they circle the planet.\u00a0  Shown here is Vast's Haven-1 station as it completes testing in the Mojave Desert in 2025.VAST   If you look at the reaction of those individuals and what they perceive, it\u2019s amazing, right? It\u2019s like awe and wonder. It\u2019s the same way that astronauts react and talk when we see Earth\u2014and say if more humans could see Earth from space, we\u2019d probably be a little bit better about being humans on Earth.\u00a0 That\u2019s the hope, is that we create that access and more people can understand what it means to live on this planet. It\u2019s essentially a spacecraft\u2014it\u2019s got its own environmental control system that keeps us alive, and that\u2019s a big deal.",
    "Related StoryWhat is the chance your plane will be hit by space debris?Read nextSome people have expressed ambitions for this kind of station to enable humans to become a multiplanetary species. Do you share that ambition for our species? If so, why?\u00a0 Yeah, I do. I just believe that humans need to have the ability to live off of the planet. I mean, we\u2019re capable of it, and we\u2019re creating that access now. So why wouldn\u2019t we explore space and go further and farther and learn to live in other areas? Not to say that we should deplete everything here and deplete everything there. But maybe we take some of the burden off of the place that we call home. I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons to live and work in space and off our own planet.\u00a0 There\u2019s not really a backup plan for no Earth. We know that there are risks from the space around us\u2014dinosaurs fell prey to space hazards. We should be aware of those and work harder to extend our capabilities and create some backup plans.\u00a0 hide"
