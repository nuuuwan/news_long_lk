    "He joined the JVP not only to stand up against the social injustices he had to face in the era when he was looking for a job after graduating and was suffering from unemployment. He actively led the JVP rebellion that emerged in 1971. He led the armed group that suppressed the Maho police and was later imprisoned as a rebel in Kurunegala, Welikada and Polonnaruwa prisons. Although he joined JVP based on youth unrest, he later left the JVP ideology and joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and started his political journey.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

    "With the U.N.P. government assuming power in 1977- which brought our country much disaster- a great violence was launched across the country.

    "In the 1982 presidential elections, a great commitment was made by him to bring victory to Hector Kobbekaduwa, the candidate of Sri Lankan National Party. However, he was defeated as a result of a conspiracy launched within the Sri Lanka National Party itself.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "After this presidential election, he became one of the founding leaders of the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, which was formed on January 22, 1981, with the split of Vijaya Kumarathunga and T.B.Ilangarathna and others. He made a great contribution to the parry to spread its tentacles nationwide. He was also a unique character among the talented orators that the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party had. On 16 February 1988, even after Vijaya Kumaratunga\u2019s death, he did not waver and bravely faced the terror launched in 1988-89 with his comrades.",
    "As a result of that, he was appointed to the post of Deputy Secretary of the party on 10 July 1988 and to the post of Vice President of the party on 12 November 1989.",
    "The members of the Mahajana Party sacrificed their lives to establish the Provincial Council, which brought a solution to the ethnic crisis.\u00a0",

    "The defeat of this person, who was a popular candidate in the Kurunegala district in the 1994 general election, is still unbelievable to us today. However, after the defeat, he fulfilled his political responsibility well, and in a few years, in the 1999 North-Western Provincial Council election, he won third place in the district. After receiving 50,000 votes from Kurunegala district in the election held in 2000, he was elected to Parliament, but not given a\u00a0",
    "ministerial post.",
    "Then in 2004, he took the leadership of the Mahajana Party to form the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance and fulfilled his historically assigned task. In 2005, under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the people rallied again and he took the lead as a pilot in the struggle for a national development path against privatization, separatist war and foreign domination.",
