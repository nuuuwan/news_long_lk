    "This story originally appeared in The Debrief with Mat Honan, your weekly take on the tech news that really matters. Sign up here to get the next one in your inbox. Last week, the US Department of Justice\u00a0released its recommendations for proposed remedies\u00a0in its antitrust case against Google. While no one thought the DOJ would go easy on Google, the remedies it did suggest are profound and, if enacted, could be catastrophic to its business.\u00a0  First, some background. The case was first filed back in 2020. Then in August, Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of DOJ (and against Google), finding that Google ran its business as an illegal monopoly. Now, the DOJ has made its case for what it thinks Google should have to do in the wake of that verdict. Next, Google will propose its own set of remedies to the court. Finally, Judge Mehta will have to decide which, if any, of these remedies to enact.\u00a0 So what is the DOJ proposing? Buckle up. The government starts by calling for an end to \u201cthird party payments.\u201d This means Google would have to stop paying the likes of Apple and Mozilla to make Google search the default engine in those companies\u2019 browsers and devices. This is not surprising. These agreements were at the heart of the matter that led to the ruling in August.",
    "Google would also be required to \u201cdisclose data sufficient to level the scale-based playing field it has illegally slanted\u201d\u2014including syndicating search results to its competitors. This basically means it would have to share its treasure trove of search data to the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI, DuckDuckGo, Brave, and on down the line.\u00a0 The DOJ also argues Google should be forced to divest \u201ccontrol and ownership\u201d of Chrome and Android. In the case of Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system that most of the phones in the world run on, Google would either have to sell it, or no longer require manufacturers, like Samsung or LG, to use its services on their devices. And if it was the latter, any deal would be subject to oversight and could\u00a0still\u00a0potentially result in a forced sale of Android if the government found Google\u2019s actions insufficient.",
    "If the other remedies are body blows, this one is more like losing a limb. Selling off Chrome and/or Android would have massive, massive consequences all across Google\u2019s lines of businesses. It\u2019s also worth noting that before he was tapped to oversee all of Google (and then Alphabet), Sundar Pichai ran Chrome and then Android. These are his babies.\u00a0 But wait, there\u2019s more! Google would also be prohibited from investing in or buying outright \u201cany search or search text ad rival, search distributor, or rival query-based AI product or ads technology.\u201d That\u2019s big because there are a lot of companies in the AI space\u00a0trying to become the search engine\u00a0of the future right now. (Though it was cleared, Google was already under scrutiny for such investments in the UK, which was\u00a0investigating its $2 billion investment in Anthropic.) Google could even be prohibited from using any properties it already owns and operates from favoring its own search or ad products. This would force the company to present users with choices of which search engines to use in its own hardware devices, like the Google Pixel phone, as well as on services like YouTube.\u00a0 There\u2019s still more on the DOJ\u2019s wish list. But you get this picture. It\u2019s a heavy hammer.\u00a0 So now what?\u00a0 You can think of where we are a little bit like the stage of a criminal trial when a defendant has been found guilty and a prosecutor suggests a sentence. The judge still has the final word here (at least until an inevitable appeal) and could choose to enact more lenient penalties along the lines of what Google will likely propose, or take up the Justice Department\u2019s set of proposals in whole or in part. (He could also just go his own way.) In short, now we know what the DOJ would like to see happen. And of course the whole thing\u00a0couldwill go to appeal. So, what will actually happen remains to be seen.\u00a0 Related StoryGoogle\u2019s Astra is its first AI-for-everything agentUsers will be able to interact with the AI assistant using audio and video when it launches later this year.",
    "What will Trump do? A little bit of a wild card in all this is that by the time Judge Mehta gets around to a ruling (he has set a two week hearing for April with a ruling\u00a0projected in August 2025) there will be an entirely new administration in office. In theory, the Trump administration could drop the case altogether or push for lighter remedies. While we don\u2019t yet\u00a0know\u00a0what it will do, it\u2019s worth considering that Google does not have many friends in Trumpworld. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance has said bluntly that \u201cit\u2019s time to break Google up.\u201d Trump has long aired grievances about the company. And the suit began, remarkably,\u00a0four years ago under the first Trump administration.\u00a0 But, then again, in\u00a0an interview last month,\u00a0Bloomberg News\u00a0editor in chief John Micklethwait asked Trump if Google-parent Alphabet should be broken up. After a series of complaints and digressions about how he appeared in its search results, Trump more or less equivocated. He called breaking up Google \u201ca very dangerous thing\u201d and noted that \u201cChina is afraid of Google.\u201d And then: \u201cSometimes you have to fight through these threats. I\u2019m not a fan of Google. They treat me badly, but are you going to destroy the company by doing that?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair.\u201d So maybe Trump will see Google as a bulwark against China. If there\u2019s one thing he seems to like less than Google, it\u2019s China? Or, well, who knows, it could come down to who Trump talked to last. As\u00a0The Verge\u00a0editor in chief Nilay Patel pointed out, some of Trump\u2019s allies in tech are already strongly in the anti-Google camp: \u201cThe problem for Google is that Andreessen, Vance, Musk etc all sort of love this idea,\u201d\u00a0he skeeted on Bluesky.\u00a0(Yeah, that\u2019s\u00a0what you call it. Sorry, I don\u2019t make the rules.)",
    "I would add Peter Thiel to that list as a very notable \u201cetc.\u201d Thiel has been extremely critical of Google, and has come down in particular on its relationship with China. He\u2019s\u00a0written an op-ed in the\u00a0New York Timesabout it, and has gone so far as to call the company \u201cseemingly treasonous.\u201d So, there\u2019s that.\u00a0 What do I think? I\u2019m not a lawyer! This is not investment advice! Blah blah blah! But I\u2019ve been covering Google for a long, long time. Nearly my entire career.\u00a0 Do I think Google has grown too big and too powerful? Absolutely! No one company should have as much market dominance as it does. Not Google. Not Apple. Not Meta. Not Amazon. Not Microsoft. Which means it\u2019s especially messed up that they all are that big. Big Tech reminds me of the famous political cartoon(s) of the great colonial powers\u00a0carving up their own spheres of influence, except in this case we are all China.\u00a0  Still, I\u2019ll say something that may be a little contrarian here: I think Google\u2019s control over Chrome and Android are more or less beneficial for consumers, or at least help provide a good\u00a0experience. The data collection practices are horrendous and potentially dangerous. And yes, product \u201cecosystems\u201d are most often swamps that are meant to make it hard to get out of any given system.\u00a0 But the way Google has made so many of its products\u2014Chrome, Gmail, Search, Maps, Gemini, Android, Photos, etc.\u2014highly interoperable is kinda nice when you look at it from a purely user-centric perspective. It means you can share your data and log in and history and, to some extent, personality across lots of different products in ways that make life at least a tiny bit more convenient. This may seem trivial, but when you get an email confirming a doctor\u2019s appointment, which Google then automatically adds to your calendar, alerts you with a notification on your phone that it\u2019s time to depart in order to arrive on time, and then helps you navigate to the new office, it\u2019s pretty helpful.\u00a0 That said, I think any remedies should target the agreements Google has with other companies to keep its engine as the default. For the first time in decades, we\u2019re starting to see real search alternatives emerge and they should not be stifled by secret multi-billion dollar agreements among the great powers. I also think a good ruling would limit Google\u2019s ability to prioritize its own products and services in search results\u2014for example, when I search for \u201ca good Thai restaurant near me,\u201d Google displays the actual results with a list of restaurants from its database with its user reviews, plotted out on its own Maps product, and this is all above a link to Yelp that might actually have better review data and the same mapping.\u00a0 Maybe you disagree! Well, there is still plenty of time to argue with me and tell me I\u2019m wrong. The only thing that\u2019s certain at this point is that this case is going to drag on for a long time.",

    "Mat: Hey Eileen, I loved your story on Clear. It\u2019s such a strange company. What does it do exactly? Eileen: Thanks! That it\u2019s so ubiquitous but also under the radar is why I wanted to write about it. Clear is a biometric identity company. Initially, it allowed members to go through airport security a little bit faster\u2014by submitting to background checks and then, once at the airport, verify their identities with their biometrics. But for the past few years, it\u2019s been aggressively expanding outside of airports. Mat: How did this private company get to take responsibility for identity verification at airports? Eileen: Clear started in the aftermath of 9/11, when airport security was a mess and everyone\u2014Congress, the newly created TSA, travelers\u2014was looking for a solution to speed up the process without (theoretically) sacrificing security. Verified Identity Pass, as the company was then known, was one of a few companies that stepped up and it was the most successful by far. I think that was because it was really good at public-private partnerships. It really grew by renting space from the airports where it operated; for every person that signed up, the airports would also receive a portion of revenue. Mat: You\u2019ve written about biometrics several times now. Are we on an inevitable journey to using our faces and fingers as identifiers? Like, at some point if I want a Big Mac, am I going to have to scan my eyeballs into the drive thru camera? Eileen: I think the companies selling the technology want it to feel inevitable, and more companies are certainly trying to push pay by palm or iris or face, so we'll see more of it, but we're also seeing other ways of proving our digital identities. Biometrics is one solution (with a lot of problems). But it's not the only one. Mat: Anything surprise you when you reported this out? Eileen: I guess I hadn't understood how much the biometrics and identity space is really commoditized. One of our early questions was, what is Clear's technology? But Clear doesn't write the facial verification or other algorithms that it uses; it chooses the best ones, and then its real differentiator is packaging it all together in a platform that is easy to use\u2014both for its business customers (like LinkedIn or Home Depot) and us, its human customers.  The Recommendation As a sad old GenXer, nothing makes me feel sadder or older than seeing bands I loved as a kid, bands that sometimes felt dangerous or revolutionary or deeply weird, shuffling around on stage in orthopedic shoes selling nostalgia to graying, pot-bellied old people wearing the same Ben Davies pants they bought at the community thrift in 1994. Don\u2019t get me wrong! I was swooning with all the other aging hipsters on statins at the Magnetic Fields and Bikini Kill and Smashing Pumpkins and Green Day shows this year. And I fully intend to see Kim Deal come tour next year, especially because it will give me a chance to once again talk about how I saw her open for Nirvana. But all these things just remind me that I\u2019m gonna die. Which is why I have been extremely behind the times in listening to The Cure\u2019s new album, Songs of a Lost World. But as everybody has been saying, it is easily one of their best albums, period, and one of the best albums of the year as well. Maybe it helps that their music has always been the kind of stuff that reminds me I\u2019m gonna die, but in a good way! Anyway. If you have not already, go give it a listen. \u201cEndsong\u201d in particular is really beautiful. (And, uh, maybe about getting old and dying.)  hide"
