Sri Lanka's government has been criticised for a culture of corruption and self-serving politics that prioritises personal gains over public welfare. The granting of duty-free vehicle permits for Members of Parliament (MPs) is seen as a key example. Despite the nation's economic struggles, MPs enjoy luxuries at the expense of taxpayers and indulge in extravagance with impunity. The National People's Power (NPP) party, however, has expressed its intent to dismantle this system of privileges if it takes over the government. Various changes, such as the abolition of laws that facilitate the sale of duty-free permits and increased measures to ensure transparency, are suggested as necessary for meaningful change.
