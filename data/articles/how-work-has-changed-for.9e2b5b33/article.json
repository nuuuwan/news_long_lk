    "Despite progress in the past decade, gender equity still remains uneven in U.S. companies. Coupled with recent political attacks on the very concept of DEI and declines in corporate commitments to racial and gender equity, there\u2019s concern that the next...more",
    "Ten years ago, I was feeling burned out after leaving a corporate job in the technology industry, where I had faced and witnessed bias, racism, and sexual harassment. The prevailing narrative around me about gender inequality was that women weren\u2019t driven or confident enough to succeed in the workplace. Given that, seeing such ambitious, brilliant women colleagues \u2014 particularly women of color \u2014 face such inequities felt like cognitive dissonance. And yet the \u201cwomen need to do better\u201d narrative persisted.",
    "At the time, a friend sent me a new McKinsey and Lean In \u201cWomen in the Workplace\u201d report. In bold letters at the top were the words \u201cCorporate America is not on a path to gender equality.\u201d I felt both stunned and validated. Here was actual research that literally captured the observations and experiences I had been grappling with. The study spurred me to do my own research, advocacy, and writing on how to fix gender and racial equity at work.",
    "Fortunately, much has improved in the past decade. We\u2019ve learned to more openly accept gender and racial inequalities as structural issues, not what I call \u201cfix women\u201d ones. Leaders have stepped up commitments to do better at solving for both. Words like \u201cbias\u201d \u201cmicroaggressions,\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d are all more accepted in the corporate lexicon. (So much so that I\u2019ve even made the case for leaders to retire the term \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d in favor of \u201cexclusionary behaviors.\u201d)",
    "Despite this progress, gender equity still remains uneven. Coupled with recent political attacks on the very concept of DEI and declines in corporate commitments to racial and gender equity, there\u2019s concern that the next decade may not bring as much progress as the last one \u2014 which is why we need to keep our foot on the accelerator when it comes to achieving gender parity at work.",
    "Progress on Corporate Gender Advancement Is Mixed",
    "Since it was first released in 2015, the Women in the Workplace report has become more intersectional and nuanced, getting more detailed about the particular obstacles preventing women of color from progressing in corporate America. The latest version of the report looks back on the past decade of women\u2019s experiences. As it stands, women today make up 29% of C-suite positions, up from 17% in 2015. That represents a meaningful gain, but at the current rate of progress, it will take women of color 48 years to reach parity in corporate America, compared with 22 years for white women.",
    "The report also finds that being an \u201conly\u201d \u2014 that is, one of the only people of their race or gender in the room at work \u2014 continues to be a common experience for women, with no change since 2018: One in five women today say they\u2019re onlys for their gender and two in five are onlys for their race. Onlys report encountering more microaggressions at work, which profoundly detract from their workplace experiences, and are also more likely to feel they\u2019re under additional scrutiny.",
    "The report also finds that organizational and leader commitments to gender and racial diversity are declining. In 2019, 87% of companies cited gender diversity as a high priority, and 77% cited racial diversity as high priority. In 2024, those numbers dropped to 78% and 69%, respectively, which the report\u2019s authors rightly described as \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d That tracks with my recent experiences in my work as an inclusion strategist: I\u2019ve observed a decline in DEI commitments at a number of organizations. Moreover, I\u2019ve seen leaders give in to political pressure to step back on commitments to racial equity, particularly after last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision to limit affirmative action in colleges.",
    "Recommendations for Advancing Gender Equity",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning in this year\u2019s report is the commitment to diversity is starting to slide backward,\u201d Lean In\u2019s founder, Sheryl Sandberg, told me. \u201cCompanies have the power to drive significant change, and now isn\u2019t the time to slow down.\u201d",
    "So how can organizations that haven\u2019t backed down on their commitments \u2014 or those that have even doubled down and resisted opposition to DEI \u2014 continue to make progress? What actually works?",
    "As it turns out, many of the tactics experts and scholars have been recommending to company leaders for years have been paying off and yielding progress for women in the workplace. Here are some of the specific recommendations cited in the report:",
    "Reducing bias in hiring",
    "Hiring processes are riddled with bias \u2014 think screening out resumes with names that are recognizably non-Anglo Saxon or hiring for \u201cculture fit.\u201d Organizations must identify and root out those biases using interventions known to be successful, such as: removing names and other gender and racially identifiable information from resumes so that women and people of color aren\u2019t screened out in the first stage; bringing consistency to the interview process by using standardized questions for candidates; and ensuring there\u2019s gender and racial diversity in the candidate pool.",
    "Reducing bias in performance evaluations",
    "Men often get more actionable feedback at work than women do, and without standardized performance evaluations, it\u2019s easy for managers to fall prey to gender and racial biases when making promotion decisions. This means the performance-evaluation process can harm not only women\u2019s career advancement, but it can also be a drag on retention.",
    "As one respondent, a Latina senior manager, stated in the report: \u201cI think about keeping women and women of color satisfied and staying with the organization, and I think the biggest thing companies could do is to make sure they are not being reviewed more harshly than their peers. Often, we are held to higher standards than our peers, which impacts us for salaries or promotions.\u201d",
    "While bias training as a standalone intervention isn\u2019t sufficient to reduce bias in the workplace, it can be effective when it\u2019s targeted. When managers making performance evaluation and promotion decisions are made aware of how biases show up in performance evaluations, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest they\u2019ll consider them when making decisions about compensation and promotions.",
    "Activating managers to build an inclusive culture",
    "Success in advancing gender equity requires leadership commitment, consistency, and accountability, driven by personal buy-in on why DEI is important. \u201cWhen we work with leaders, we start with building a shared understanding that inclusion is a key leadership skill and they should hold themselves accountable for leading with inclusion,\u201d as leadership and workplace culture expert La\u2019Kita Williams recommends. \u201cLeaders should also look out for systemic barriers that are in place for women of color and actively advocate for change in the system.\u201d",
    "The good news is that the report cites a significant rise in managers prioritizing inclusion over the past decade. Unfortunately, many managers also reported a critical lack of support and feeling spread too thin, with 42% reporting often or always feeling burned out compared to 33% of non-managers. Organizations must find ways to reduce managers\u2019 individual workloads so they have more time to support their teams. They can also provide managers with tools such as standardized questions to gauge their team members\u2019 well-being and sample scripts for important career conversations.",
    "Inspiring employees to become agents of change",
    "I\u2019ve often observed a gap between the \u201cwhy\u201d of DEI and how employees can actually connect with it. The report recommends rallying employees by making explicit the link between an organization\u2019s values and advancing women, for example: \u201cIf your company values innovation, share research findings that diverse teams are often more innovative. Or, if you are customer focused, talk about how having more women in leadership can help enhance products geared to women.\u201d",
    "Creating allyship opportunities for men",
    "Because they still comprise the majority of leadership positions, it\u2019s critical for male employees to participate in advancing their women colleagues. Organizations should consider sponsoring allyship groups in the same way they sponsor other ERGs. These allyship groups often provide camaraderie and a structured way for men and other allies to participate. Employer-sponsored groups signal that allyship is aligned with company priorities, which can help motivate men to get involved.",
    "Providing benefits that support parents, caregivers, and employees facing health issues",
    "There\u2019s been a significant improvement in company benefits that support a vast swath of employees over the past decade. From extended parental leave to backup childcare and increased flexibility, employer benefits are linked to higher rates of happiness and better employee retention. While beneficial to all, they\u2019re especially helpful to women, who are more likely to have caregiving responsibilities.",
    "Without a doubt, we cannot back down from the DEI progress that\u2019s been made in the past 10 years. It\u2019s especially concerning to see company commitments lessening on gender and racial equity precisely when we need them the most. I\u2019ve been heartened to see some forward-thinking leaders and organizations continuing (and in some cases even increasing) their commitments. But we truly need everyone to be involved, particularly as we know progress is still slow for women of color.",
    "While I don\u2019t make the business case for DEI any longer, there are undeniable reasons for why leaders need to stay the course. As Sandberg emphasized to me, \u201cLeaders need to stay fully committed to gender and racial equity, and to ensure that managers and employees know that diversity benefits everyone \u2014 and it\u2019s good for business.\u201d",
