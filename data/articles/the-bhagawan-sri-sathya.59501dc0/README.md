When we were born into this world, we were all human beings—Homo sapiens—a Latin term meaning “wise man.” This species is distinguished by a highly developed brain, articulate speech, and the ability to reason abstractly. Yet, despite these capabilities, humanity has divided itself along the lines of citizenship, religion, race, and caste, isolating and opposing one another, often with destructive consequences. The day we truly understand that we are all one, and that our mission is to serve one another with love and compassion, many of the world’s problems will cease to exist

Baba reminded humanity that everyone strives for happiness, yet true bliss cannot be found in material things, the external world, or other people. Bliss resides within the self. We have forgotten our true nature, the source of eternal joy, and instead pursue artificial happiness in external forms. Real happiness dawns only when one turns inward to the heart, where the principle of love originates

Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, one of the most revered spiritual masters of our time, was born on 23 November 1926. Having dedicated His entire life to graciously serving humanity, He attained Samadhi on 24 April 2011. His mission was to foster spiritual regeneration through selfless service, with a core message of love, peace, and compassion. He vowed to guide those who had strayed back to goodness, to relieve the suffering of the poor, and to help humanity recognise its own inherent divinity. He sought to achieve this by inculcating the spirit and practice of the principle that “Serving man is serving God.”

The lasting essence of Baba’s teachings, absorbed by his followers over the decades, was encapsulated in the timeless message: “Love All, Serve All; Help Ever, Hurt Never.” This is a deeply pragmatic philosophy that each of us can live by in our day-to-day lives.

To reiterate Baba’s mission, His centenary celebration was recently held at Puttaparthi, India, with a series of events attended by devotees and dignitaries from around the world

To reiterate Baba’s mission, His centenary celebration was recently held at Puttaparthi, India, with a series of events attended by devotees and dignitaries from around the world, including the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. Speaking at the ceremony, Prime Minister Modi emphasised that the central value of Indian civilisation is Seva or Service. He observed that all of India’s diverse spiritual and philosophical traditions ultimately lead to this one idea. The Sanskrit phrase ‘Seva Paramo Dharma’, meaning ‘selfless service is the highest duty,’ has been the ethos that has sustained India through centuries of changes and challenges. Sri Sathya Sai Baba, Prime Minister said, placed Seva at the very heart of human life. He often proclaimed, “Love All, Serve All,” and for Him, Seva was ‘love in action’. The many institutions established by Baba in the fields of education, healthcare, rural development and numerous other areas stand as living proof of his philosophy. Thus, spirituality and service are not separate but are different expressions of the same truth. It is not uncommon for a person to inspire others during their lifetime, but it is truly remarkable that the Seva activities initiated by Baba continue to expand even in his physical absence.

Other speakers at the event reminded the audience that Sathya Sai Baba’s mission had always been to silently transform the world by re-establishing the eternal values of truth, right conduct, peace, love and non-violence in the daily lives of all human beings. Baba referred to these as the building blocks of harmony. He also urged people to be patriotic and to respect the laws of the country they belong to, as this would lead to peace and harmony in society.

Baba’s teachings were universal and applicable to all religions. He did not seek to establish a new faith but rather encouraged individuals to return to the roots of their own religion and rediscover the universal truth contained within it. His purpose was to inspire all to become exemplary human beings through understanding and practising their own spiritual heritage.

Sri Sathya Sai Baba declared that He had come to serve all mankind, not any particular community, religion, country, or interest group. He did not come to establish a new religion or philosophy, but to reveal the foundation of love on which all life is based. He said, “I have come not to disturb or destroy any faith, but to confirm each in his own faith, so that a Buddhist may become a better Buddhist, a Hindu a better Hindu, a Christian a better Christian, and a Muslim a better Muslim. I have come to reconstruct the ancient highway to God, to instruct all in the essence of the scriptures, to shower on all this precious gift, to protect the ‘Eternal Righteousness’ and preserve it. My mission is to serve happiness, and so I am always happy to come amongst you, not once but twice, thrice, as often as you wish me. To set right those who have gone astray and to protect the good, Sai will be born again and again.”

To a spiritual aspirant, He is the Divine Master par excellence; to a rationalist, He is the greatest humanitarian on earth; to thousands of modern youth, He is a dynamic leader and a colossus of inspiration; to a devotee, He is divinity in human form; and to all who have had the blessing of beholding Him, He is pure love walking on two feet.

When asked, “Are You God?” Baba replied, “Yes, I am God, and so are you. The only difference between you and me is that while I am aware of this fact, you are not.” This sentiment echoes the words of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the twentieth-century French philosopher, palaeontologist, and Jesuit priest who explored the intersection of religion, evolution and consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin once said, “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.” This profound statement encapsulates his belief that our true identity is spiritual, and our earthly existence is merely a temporary phase of that larger reality.

The main purpose of the Sathya Sai Organisation is to help individuals realise their innate divinity and to practise divine love through selfless service. Baba’s teachings emphasise the inherent divinity within every human being, which can be realised through a moral life, selfless service, and spiritual practices that cultivate love, truth, and non-violence. His core principles include recognising the oneness of all religions, following one’s conscience, and developing inner purity through good thoughts, words, and actions. A central tenet of His philosophy is to purify one’s heart and mind by seeing service to others as service to the Divine itself.

Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba outlined His divine mission in His own words: “I have a Task: to foster all mankind and ensure for all of them lives full of Ananda (bliss). I have a Vow: to lead all who stray away from the straight path again into goodness and save them. I am attached to a Work that I love: to remove the sufferings of the poor and grant them what they lack.”

He taught that one should always remain aware that the Lord is omnipresent and act with the feeling that every deed is done for His pleasure, for this is the easiest way to control the mind. If one believes that the body belongs to the Lord, one will not sin through it. Instead, all actions and endeavours will be directed towards divinity. Recognising that one’s energy belongs to God prevents its misuse and ensures that life’s efforts are guided by higher purpose.

Baba reminded humanity that everyone strives for happiness, yet true bliss cannot be found in material things, the external world, or other people. Bliss resides within the self. We have forgotten our true nature, the source of eternal joy, and instead pursue artificial happiness in external forms. Real happiness dawns only when one turns inward to the heart, where the principle of love originates.

He urged people to cultivate love above all else, warning that hatred and anger were the root causes of fear and unrest. “Light the lamp of love within,” He said, “and fear and illusion will vanish.” He further taught that people must learn to impose a ceiling on their desires. Just as there are ceilings on land and property, there must be restraint on personal wants. “Less luggage, more comfort makes travel a pleasure,” He explained. When desires are curtailed, happiness naturally increases. He reminded all that reality lies in simplicity and that minimalistic living helps eliminate distractions and fosters inner peace.

These are the basic teachings of all religions, simple truths that anyone can follow with common sense. When we were born into this world, we were all human beings—Homo sapiens—a Latin term meaning “wise man.” This species is distinguished by a highly developed brain, articulate speech, and the ability to reason abstractly. Yet, despite these capabilities, humanity has divided itself along the lines of citizenship, religion, race, and caste, isolating and opposing one another, often with destructive consequences. The day we truly understand that we are all one, and that our mission is to serve one another with love and compassion, many of the world’s problems will cease to exist. When peace is established globally, the vast sums of money spent on wars can instead be channelled into uplifting the quality of human life and promoting longevity, health, and harmony.

By living according to the fundamental values of Sathya (Truth), Dharma (Right Conduct), Shanthi (Peace), Prema (Love), and Ahimsa (Non-Violence), as taught by Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, we can embark on a journey of inner transformation and spiritual fulfilment. On this special day, let us remind ourselves of our true purpose in life. Celebrations serve as reminders, and this occasion invites us to reflect upon Baba’s simple yet powerful message: “Love in action is service.” In today’s commercial world, the act of caring—which every human being needs from the womb to the tomb—getting into action is service. With every opportunity we receive to serve another, let us make this world a better place for all to live in peace, harmony, and joy.
