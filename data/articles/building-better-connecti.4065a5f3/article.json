    "The rapidly advancing sophistication of generative and agentic AI is escalating consumer expectations for personalized, conversational brand interactions in real time and in natural language.",
    "By now most consumers expect their brand interactions to be fully connected, meaningful, and secure. One in four customers now turn to AI-powered platforms as their primary source when they search for information, make purchase decisions, or find recommendations\u2014surpassing brand websites and online reviews\u2014Adobe\u2019s 2026 AI and Digital Trends survey reveals.",
    "Given these standards for conversational interactions, C-suite leaders need to deliver effective, streamlined experiences.",
    "But some brands struggle to deliver. Challenges may be lurking throughout an organization. Legacy infrastructure can trap customer data in silos, keeping useful insights out of content workflows.",
    "And marketing and content teams might have difficulty producing high-quality on-brand assets across channels and markets in real time. That\u2019s an urgent concern: In the last two years, individuals consumed 72% more reviews and testimonials and 69% more influencer content before making a purchase\u2014a clear sign they are engaging with more content than ever.",
    "But by upgrading infrastructure with AI-powered customer experience orchestration (CXO), organizations can coordinate data across teams, channels, and markets to boost brand visibility and build loyalty for the age of agentic AI.",
    "CXO lets teams across an organization build, manage, and coordinate AI agents, giving this technology the data-driven reasoning and expertise to make complex decisions and solve customer problems at speed and scale.",
    "For organizations seeking to offer engagement and experiences that strengthen brand loyalty, heighten brand visibility in a competitive and dynamic environment, and generate useful content at the pace and volume their customers need, CXO is critical to success.",
    "CXO can help organizations achieve in three key strategic areas and objectives:",
    "1. Improving customer engagement. CXO technology can help an organization personalize its customers\u2019 experiences and build their brand loyalty by unifying and coordinating data, insights, orchestration, planning, content management, and delivery across channels.",
    "2. Strengthening the content supply chain. Visibility to consumers requires an ever-increasing volume of marketing information. To deliver personalized campaigns at the demanding speed and scale organizations need, AI-powered CXO can upgrade the supply chain for planning, creating, managing, activating, and measuring digital content.",
    "3. Boosting brand visibility. With generative engine optimization (GEO) overtaking traditional search engine optimization (SEO) for brand discovery, marketing content needs to reach the large language models (LLMs) that power these natural conversations. Optimized CXO can help ensure brand visibility in AI search results and help teams create more engaging online content more efficiently through AI automation.",
    "More Personalization, Less Production",
    "Some of the world\u2019s biggest global brands are using CXO tools and strategies to build brand loyalty by forging meaningful personalized connections at scale.",
    "When establishing an effective consumer personalization strategy across e-commerce and marketing touchpoints, Coca-Cola needed to coordinate a range of fragmented and third-party data. The company launched its personalization initiative in Latin America, using the region\u2019s significant website traffic and consumer data to build a data, commerce, and customer engagement CXO foundation for personalized shopping experiences at scale.",
    "After setting up teams to encourage collaboration and eliminating silos to integrate and centralize data, Coca-Cola created rich customer profiles powering sophisticated personalized connections across channels including email, websites, and messaging apps. That upgrade increased engagement and retention, with an 89% conversion rate among re-engaged shoppers.",
    "After it expanded its Latin America playbook to the Coca-Cola Store in the U.S., the company\u2019s one-to-one product recommendations based on shopper behaviors and affinities drove a 36% revenue increase and a 17% click-through rate on its \u201cfrequently bought together\u201d prompt.",
    "The marketing team at online retailer Amazon Fresh develops seasonal and evergreen campaigns featuring carefully staged brand photography. As consumer demand is rising for more promotions in more regions on tighter deadlines, the retailer needed to strengthen its production capabilities to produce more app banners, social media, in-store displays, and other messaging at scale and at speed so its workforce could focus on generating creative ideas rather than managing production logistics.",
    "With a partner agency, Amazon Fresh incorporated a CXO strategy and tools to produce generative AI-powered on-brand campaign visuals that repurpose existing assets to deliver visuals faster and with more variation. The change helped the marketing team reduce production time by 93%.",
    "The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies recently strengthened its creative workflows with a CXO approach to efficiently create generative AI-powered content for 25 global beauty brands so its teams could deliver more-personalized high-quality digital marketing assets faster and with less manual effort.",
    "With a CXO foundation powered by generative AI, Est\u00e9e Lauder can keep its focus on innovation instead of time-consuming and repetitive content-creation processes. Such streamlined workflows and better connections with its consumers at scale are critical differences in a competitive sector with high demand both for innovation and for the campaigns to promote it.",
    "As consumers increasingly expect meaningful conversational connections with the brands they use, the need for real-time personalization at scale is only intensifying. In this environment, brands incorporating CXO technology and strategies to reach their consumers position themselves to lead their sectors and build greater customer loyalty.",
