A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a formal approach to remedy an employee’s performance gaps, including failures to meet specific job goals or behavior-related concerns. The plan outlines the existing issues and defines what new outputs and behaviors are needed by when. But is a PIP the right choice for your situation? Will it work? Is it worth the effort? Here are some tips on determining if a PIP is the right path and, if so, how to implement one optimally.

Do you have an underperforming employee who has been falling short of your standards recently? Have they caused a string of performance failures, such as missed deadlines, gotten poor customer feedback, or negatively impacted your team dynamics?
