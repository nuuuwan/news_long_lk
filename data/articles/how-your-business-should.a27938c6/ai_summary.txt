Content creators are changing consumer behavior and forcing businesses to rethink product and business strategies in the consumer goods and services industries. Creators are driving demand for increasingly specialized products and services, accelerating product life cycles, and changing what consumers actually value. Through their content, creators can create demand for niche products and services, teach consumers new skills to use more complex products, and accelerate product life cycles. Possible strategies for businesses to deal with the disruptive force of content creators include developing an asset-light operating model, cultivating collaborative partnerships with creators, exploring new positions in the value chain, and using AI and predictive analytics to stay ahead of customer trends.
