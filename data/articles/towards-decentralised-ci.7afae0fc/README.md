It’s now time to choose an innovative system of governance

Executive summary: Sri Lanka’s politically tarnished centralised system of governance structure has continued to disenfranchise the majority of its citizens and has robbed its true potential before and since independence was granted, in spite of multiple constitutions and social uprisings. The need of the hour before we face a crash is to reimagine the country’s political and administrative systems to prioritise capable, service-oriented, and preferably apolitical leadership at the local levels. This policy brief proposes a structural overhaul that emphasises decentralised governance, constitutional reform, and digital connectivity to enable a transparent, inclusive, and modern governance system aligned to protect and serve the needs of 22 million Sri Lankans.

Problem statement: Sri Lanka’s current model, dominated by a centralised political party elite, has repeatedly failed to address local issues or empower communities. Citizens often feel ignored after each post-election, and corruption remains rampant due to a lack of accountability and operational inefficiency at every level. Without structural change, the cycle of disillusionment and underdevelopment is likely to persist, despite changing political cults from now-irrelevant UNP/SJB, SLFP/SLPP remnants known for looting the country in broad daylight, and the NPP is yet to present a compelling vision for a transformational future despite a Marxist–Leninist political umbrella which they have failed to shed.

Policy recommendations

1.Decentralised governance responsibilities

Limit the central government to national and international issues:

Strategic defence initiatives and proactive foreign relations to advance the nation’s interests and values on the global stage

National education policy is based on a strong foundation and is open to exploring various opportunities through continuous education

Legal and judicial coherence to create a level playing field

Promote inter-provincial and international commerce

Available and affordable Infrastructure development (e.g., broadband, utilities and transportation)

National budget to develop infrastructure, support regional development, and provide fiscal oversight

Empower regional governments to manage:

Independence for local economic development (e.g., SMEs) based on a central theme of innovation, and by removing colonial/cultural hurdles

Uncompromised public safety and available and affordable local healthcare

Community development and primary education

2.Constitutional reforms

Establish a unified legal framework redefining power-sharing between central and local governments.

Clarify shared responsibilities in areas such as taxation, infrastructure, and the judiciary.

Appoint elected local representatives to the central government for brief periods and avoid duplicate elections

Create mechanisms for local government accountability by introducing key performance deliverables and holding elected apolitical provincial Governors accountable

Let the elected Governors appoint a seasoned professional CEO (not a political party leader) with key deliverables to lead the nation as the CEO of the National Government

3.Digital connectivity as the new Mahaweli project

Launch a national initiative to connect all local governments and communities via robust digital infrastructure.

Leverage technology for transparency, service delivery, and citizen engagement.

Use digital tools for real-time data collection, resource allocation, and feedback mechanisms.

4,Youth engagement and leadership development

Mobilise a new generation of leaders committed to operational excellence and public service.

Invest in training programs and incubators for local governance innovation.

Promote civic education to build awareness and responsibility among young citizens.

5.Reform public finance and international negotiations

Improve capacity for negotiating international agreements (e.g., IMF, MCC, SOFA) with transparency and strategic foresight.

Adopt best practices in fiscal discipline, reporting standards, and accountability metrics.

Integrate these disciplines across all levels of government using modern systems.

Implementation considerations

A phased approach to constitutional reform, beginning with pilot regions

Stakeholder engagement at all levels: civil society, youth, private sector, and diaspora

Strategic partnerships for digital infrastructure investment

Continuous monitoring and adaptive policy-making

Driven by youth for the youth, preferably of the youth

Conclusion: Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment of growth or falling down a precipice, as we seem to have exhausted all established options. It’s now time to choose an innovative system of governance by embracing decentralised governance, constitutional clarity, and digital transformation to level the playing field, so everyone can participate and contribute to create a new future of inclusive development and public trust. This transformation must be led by a new generation of leaders with a new vision and integrity to deliver lasting solutions, not just more commissions and promises.
