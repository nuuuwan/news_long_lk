    "US President Donald Trump",
    "Donald J. Trump, ever an apprentice showman fired a move that left economists bamboozled and sarong-wearing Sri Lankan villagers scratching their heads; Trump unveiled his latest global trade scheme. Dubbed as \u201cMake America great again, one sarong at a time\u201d initiative, the plan imposes tariffs on imports from poor Asian nations, including textiles, spices, and\u2014yes\u2014sarongs. Trump declared, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing jobs back to America! And by jobs, I mean the ones we farmed-out decades ago.\u201d",
    "At a rally, Trump proudly waved a sarong, claiming it epitomised \u201cforeign interference in American fashion.\u201d Cohorts cheered, chanting \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d while a few in the crowd whispered, \u201cDoes he know what a sarong is?\u201d The tariffs include a 44% tax on sarongs, which Trump described as \u201cun-American skirts,\u201d and a 25% tax on spices, because \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t need to curry foreign flavour.\u201d",
    "Social media erupted with memes, including one of Trump wearing a sarong with the caption, \u201cWhen in doubt, tariff it out.\u201d Another viral post showed a sarong-clad villager holding a sign that read, \u201cSarongs unite us, tariffs divide us.\u201d Meanwhile, Asian leaders responded with humour. Sri Lanka\u2019s president quipped, \u201cWe\u2019ll send him a sarong\u2014it\u2019s perfect for dodging tough questions.\u201d India\u2019s prime minister simply laughed and offered Trump a butter chicken recipe.",
    "As the tariffs take effect, Americans are bracing for impact. Fashion designers are scrambling to create \u201cliberation sarongs\u201d made entirely of denim, and grocery stores are stocking up on bland spices to replace imports. One entrepreneur launched a \u201cTrump\u2019s spice blend\u201d made of salt and pepper, claiming it\u2019s \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, international leaders are reportedly baffled. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was overheard saying, \u201cIs this a joke? Are we on South Park?\u201d while French President Emmanuel Macron simply sighed and opened a bottle of wine complimented with French blue cheese.",
    "As the tariffs take effect, Americans are bracing for impact. Grocery stores are stocking up on \u201cliberation fries\u201d to replace French cheese, and tech companies are scrambling to find alternatives to Chinese electronics. One Silicon Valley CEO quipped, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start making calculators out of wood.\u201d",
    "Trump\u2019s tariffs may not make America great again, but they\u2019ve certainly made it groan again. And if nothing else, they\u2019ve given sarongs a moment in the spotlight."
