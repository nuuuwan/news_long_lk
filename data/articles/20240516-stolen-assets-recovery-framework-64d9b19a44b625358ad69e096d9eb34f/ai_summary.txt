- Protests in 2022 highlighted the call for recovering stolen assets, similar to the Abacha loot returned to Nigeria by Switzerland.
- Sri Lanka's government committed to enact a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) by April 2024, as per an IMF agreement.
- A committee chaired by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda produced a 182-page report on the POCA framework.
- The proposed framework needs significant improvements to prevent re-stealing of recovered assets and curb abuse of power.
- The Proceeds of Crime Management Authority (PCMA) and the Victims of Crime Reparation Trust Fund (VCRTF) need robust safeguards against fraud and corruption.
- Past international experiences, like Nigeria and Ukraine, show high risks of re-corruption.
- The proposed law should ensure due process, protecting individual rights and requiring judicial orders for asset investigation notices.
- Public participation is crucial in asset recovery, enhancing legal standing and right to information according to UNCAC and GFAR Principles.
- The current framework offers limited public consultation and lacks a solid provision for information transparency.
- Wider public consultation and proactive measures for transparency and accountability are necessary to mitigate re-corruption risks.
- Addressing grand corruption requires dismantling entrenched political structures and implementing laws with political will.
- The proposed improvements include better safeguarding against asset disappearance, ensuring due process, providing legal standing to citizens, and maintaining transparency and right to information.
- The law-making process should be thorough and not rushed to ensure its effectiveness and public trust.
