The article emphasizes the importance of Sri Lanka's new Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA), which has been included as a structural benchmark in the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the IMF. This framework aims to combat asset theft and is inspired by international efforts, such as Nigeria's recovery of Abacha loot from Switzerland. However, the proposed framework, while a good starting point, requires significant improvements to prevent the re-theft of recovered assets and guard against the abuse of power.

Major concerns include the potential for procedural overreach without sufficient judicial oversight, especially given past abuses by the Sri Lanka Police. The draft law needs more robust checks to protect individuals' rights during investigations and prevent political or personal misuse. Additionally, the framework should enable more public participation in asset recovery processes and ensure transparency and disclosure of information, aligning with international standards like the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).

The article advocates for broader public consultation and iterative improvements to the framework, rather than rushing its enactment. Effective asset recovery laws need public involvement, strong due-process safeguards, and transparency to dismantle entrenched corruption and meet the public's demands for justice and accountability.
