    "Judging from headlines and social media posts in recent years, one might reasonably assume that AI is going to fix the power grid, cure the world\u2019s diseases, and finish my holiday shopping for me. But maybe there\u2019s just a whole lot of hype floating around out there. Related StoryAI materials discovery now needs to move into the real worldRead next This week, we published a new package called Hype Correction. The collection of stories takes a look at how the world is starting to reckon with the reality of what AI can do, and what\u2019s just fluff.  One of my favorite stories in that package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials\u2014innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.\u00a0 But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? What could that look like?",
    "For researchers hoping to find new ways to power the world (or cure disease or achieve any number of other big, important goals), a new material could change everything. The problem is, inventing materials is difficult and slow. Just look at plastic\u2014the first totally synthetic plastic was invented in 1907, but it took until roughly the 1950s for companies to produce the wide range we\u2019re familiar with today. (And of course, though it is incredibly useful, plastic also causes no shortage of complications for society.)",
    "In recent decades, materials science has fallen a bit flat\u2014David has been covering this field for nearly 40 years, and as he puts it, there have been just a few major commercial breakthroughs in that time. (Lithium-ion batteries are one.) Could AI change everything? The prospect is a tantalizing one, and companies are racing to test it out. Lila Sciences, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is working on using AI models to uncover new materials. The company can not only train an AI model on all the latest scientific literature, but also plug it into an automated lab, so it can learn from experimental data. The goal is to speed up the iterative process of inventing and testing new materials and look at research in ways that humans might miss. At an MIT Technology Review event earlier this year, I got to listen to David interview Rafael G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli, one of Lila\u2019s cofounders. As he described what the company is working on, G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli acknowledged that AI materials discovery hasn\u2019t yet seen a big breakthrough moment. Yet. G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli described how models Lila has trained are providing insights that are \u201cas deep [as] or deeper than our domain scientists would have.\u201d In the future, AI could \u201cthink\u201d in ways that depart from how human scientists approach a problem, he added: \u201cThere will be a need to translate scientific reasoning by AI to the way we think about the world.\u201d It\u2019s exciting to see this sort of optimism in materials research, but there\u2019s still a long and winding road before we can satisfyingly say that AI has transformed the field. One major difficulty is that it\u2019s one thing to take suggestions from a model about new experimental methods or new potential structures. It\u2019s quite another to actually make a material and show that it\u2019s novel and useful. You might remember that a couple of years ago, Google\u2019s DeepMind announced it had used AI to predict the structures of \u201cmillions of new materials\u201d and had made hundreds of them in the lab. But as David notes in his story, after that announcement, some materials scientists pointed out that some of the supposedly novel materials were basically slightly different versions of known ones. Others couldn\u2019t even physically exist in normal conditions (the simulations were done at ultra-low temperatures, where atoms don\u2019t move around much).",
    "It\u2019s possible that AI could give materials discovery a much-needed jolt and usher in a new age that brings superconductors and batteries and magnets we\u2019ve never seen before. But for now, I\u2019m calling hype.\u00a0 This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.  hide"
