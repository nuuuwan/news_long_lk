This op-ed piece from Sri Lanka's Sunday Times discusses the country's use of Visa Facilitation Services (VFS), an external agency that manages the administrative process for visa applications on behalf of nations. While acknowledging that using a service like VFS might make sense for wealthier Western countries that attract small numbers of tourists from countries like Sri Lanka, the author struggles to understand why his homeland uses the service for incoming visitors. He contends that outsourcing the visa function is unnecessary because the immigration process at the airport merely requires stamping entry visas. This critique of VFS is part of a broader critique of public sector inefficiencies and failings in Sri Lanka, laying bare a dream of outsourcing even the highest offices in the land to increase efficiency and quality of service.
