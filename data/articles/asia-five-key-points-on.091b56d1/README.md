Asia: five key points on new US tariffs

ForecastingGeopoliticsTradeGlobalUnited StatesCountry Analysis

On July 31st (US time), the White House announced new tariffs rates for most major trading partners ahead of its August 1st deadline for negotiations. For Asia, these mainly settled at 15-20%, with a few exceptions. The announcement acknowledged that negotiations are still ongoing and that some may face different eventual rates. It also highlighted that goods determined to be transshipped would face a rate of 40%, although it remains unclear how that would be determined.

This precludes the worst but is still a large rise in trade barriers with the world’s largest source of demand. Tariff rates settling at 15-20% for most of the region outside of China will hurt producers, narrow profit along the supply chain and curtail US demand. That negative effect has not materialised to date—instead, the opposite has transpired, with exports elevated as US importers were front-running these tariffs. However, June trade data show that this trend is unwinding and is likely to drop off quickly in the months ahead. We expect export growth in Asia to be very weak by late 2025 and into 2026.

With most tariffs rates being similar, the new lay of the land leaves few major tariff advantages in attracting trade diversion. Activity will continue to flow out of China, which despite a continuing détente with the US, faces higher rates than anywhere else. However, no country has managed to steal a march on others by negotiating a much lower tariff than elsewhere, as some had hoped.In particular, India’s hopes of gaining a leg up in attracting production, particularly of electronics, have been dashed. Facing 25%, it now has a tariff disadvantage. Singapore and Australia do have an advantage in facing a 10% tariff, but are not in a position to capitalise much from production relocation (although Singapore may, through its special economic zone with Malaysia). Singapore will probably gain from increased transshipments trade, but that comes with its own risks. We expect that “China plus one” trends will continue to be led by the fundamentals of the attractiveness of individual business environments.

Forgoing a higher headline rate is cold comfort without more clarity on sectoral tariffs. South Korea and Japan received some reassurances on important automotive exports. However, the issues of electronics—the region’s largest export group—and pharmaceuticals (important for Singapore, South Korea, Australia and India) remain highly uncertain. South Korea only received clarification from the US that these product groups will be treated no worse than any other country. These signals suggest that the US intends to impose these sectoral tariffs, although our view remains that key carve-outs are likely—akin to what we have witnessed in the copper sector—owing to the US’s reliance on foreign chips and manufacturing equipment, which are critical to its own manufacturing ambition.

Smaller economies singled out before can breathe a sigh of relief. Previous rates of around 30-45% for the likes of Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh would have been devastating to their economies, with export sectors dependent on US demand, mainly in the area of ready-made garments. Laos continues to face a rate of 40%; its exports of solar panels to the US are not insignificant as a percentage of GDP, at around 2%. Myanmar also faces a 40% tariff rate, but the US accounts for just 3% of the export basket in 2024. US tariffs’ ramifications on global demand will be a critical factor.

US tariffs are not everything. Although no economy will remain unscathed, for many others, some themes will remain just as—if not more—important. In China, these include destructive competition among firms (known as “involution” or neijuan), fragile consumer sentiment and the ailing property sector. Elsewhere, the long run-off of high inflation and interest rates is continuing to deliver lagged benefits to private consumption in many places. The underlying business and interest rate cycle is a powerful force. This will put a floor under growth in domestic consumption-focused economies, such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines. There will also be structural growth stories, such as one we recently highlighted in Sri Lanka.
