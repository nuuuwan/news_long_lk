The AI sector is plagued by a lack of competition and a lot of deceit\u2014or at least that\u2019s one way to interpret the latest flurry of actions taken in Washington.\u00a0  Last Thursday, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Eric Schmitt introduced a bill aimed at stirring up more competition for Pentagon contracts awarded in AI and cloud computing. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle currently dominate those contracts. \u201cThe way that the big get bigger in AI is by sucking up everyone else\u2019s data and using it to train and expand their own systems,\u201d Warren told the Washington Post.\u00a0 The new bill would \u201crequire a competitive award process\u201d for contracts, which would ban the use of \u201cno-bid\u201d awards by the Pentagon to companies for cloud services or AI foundation models. (The lawmakers\u2019 move came a day after OpenAI announced that its technology would be deployed on the battlefield for the first time in a partnership with Anduril, completing a year-long reversal of its policy against working with the military.)",
    "While Big Tech is hit with antitrust investigations\u2014including the ongoing lawsuit against Google about its dominance in search, as well as a new investigation opened into Microsoft\u2014regulators are also accusing AI companies of, well, just straight-up lying.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission took action against the smart-camera company IntelliVision, saying that the company makes false claims about its facial recognition technology. IntelliVision has promoted its AI models, which are used in both home and commercial security camera systems, as operating without gender or racial bias and being trained on millions of images, two claims the FTC says are false. (The company couldn\u2019t support the bias claim and the system was trained on only 100,000 images, the FTC says.)",
    "A week earlier, the FTC made similar claims of deceit against the security giant Evolv, which sells AI-powered security scanning products to stadiums, K-12 schools, and hospitals. Evolv advertises its systems as offering better protection than simple metal detectors, saying they use AI to accurately screen for guns, knives, and other threats while ignoring harmless items. The FTC alleges that Evolv has inflated its accuracy claims, and that its systems failed in consequential cases, such as a 2022 incident when they failed to detect a seven-inch knife that was ultimately used to stab a student.\u00a0 Those add to the complaints the FTC made back in September against a number of AI companies, including one that sold a tool to generate fake product reviews and one selling \u201cAI lawyer\u201d services.\u00a0 Related StoryInside Clear\u2019s ambitions to manage your identity beyond the airportThe company that has helped millions of people cut security lines wants to give you a frictionless future\u2014in exchange for your face.",
    "The actions are somewhat tame. IntelliVision and Evolv have not actually been served fines. The FTC has simply prohibited the companies from making claims that they can\u2019t back up with evidence, and in the case of Evolv, it requires the company to allow certain customers to get out of contracts if they wish to.\u00a0 However, they do represent an effort to hold the AI industry\u2019s hype to account in the final months before the FTC\u2019s chair, Lina Khan, is replaced when Donald Trump takes office. Amid all the nominations in recent weeks, the FTC looks to have a far smoother transition of leadership ahead than most other federal agencies. On Thursday, Trump announced that he\u2019d picked Gail Slate, a tech policy advisor and a former aide to vice president\u2013elect JD Vance, to lead the agency. Trump has signaled that the FTC under Slater will keep tech behemoths like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in the crosshairs.\u00a0  \u201cBig Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\u201d Trump said in his announcement of the pick. \u201cI was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail\u2019s leadership.\u201d That said, at least some of Trump\u2019s frustrations with Big Tech are different\u2014like his concerns that conservatives could be targets of censorship and bias. And that could send antitrust efforts in a distinctly new direction on his watch.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Algorithm Deeper Learning The US Department of Defense is investing in deepfake detection The Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit, a tech accelerator within the military, has awarded its first contract for deepfake detection. Hive AI will receive $2.4 million over two years to help detect AI-generated video, image, and audio content.",
    "Why it matters: As hyperrealistic deepfakes get cheaper and easier to produce, they hurt our ability to tell what\u2019s real. The military\u2019s investment in deepfake detection shows that the problem has national security implications as well. The open question is how accurate these detection tools are, and whether they can keep up with the unrelenting pace at which deepfake generation techniques are improving.

But trying to create an AI model that can somehow provide an objective view of news events is controversial, given that models are biased both by their training data and by fine-tuning methods.
