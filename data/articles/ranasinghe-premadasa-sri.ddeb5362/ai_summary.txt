- In Sri Lanka, where caste also plays a role in politics, the numerically dominant caste among the Sinhalese are the "Govigamas" and their counterparts among the Tamils are the "Vellalas".
- Since Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948, all Prime Ministers and Presidents with one exception have been from the majority Sinhala race, the majority Buddhist religion, and the majority Govigama caste.
- The only exception was Ranasinghe Premadasa, who served as Sri Lankaâ€™s Prime Minister from 1978 to 1988 and as President from 1989 to 1993.

Opinions Expressed: 
- The role of caste in politics is viewed as distasteful to discuss, but the author notes that it cannot be ignored in the context of Sri Lankan and Indian politics. 
- Premadasa's political ascent was termed as a "formidable feat and praiseworthy accomplishment" and his journey to the presidency a "political fairy tale". 
- It was opined by many that appointing Premadasa as Deputy Minister to M. Tiruchelvam was a "blunder". 
- The author describes Premadasa as demonstrating his capacity for hard work and his administrative skills after his appointment as Local Government Minister.
- Premadasa's drastic moves to revitalise the UNP party were dismissed by Dudley Senanayake and other senior leaders, leading Premadasa to form an independent people's organisation called 'Puravesi Peramuna' or 'Citizens Front'.
