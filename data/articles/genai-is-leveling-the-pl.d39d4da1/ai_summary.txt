Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to assist small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in overcoming their inherent limitations in strategic planning and crisis management. This article features three case studies illustrating the use of AI to aid smaller businesses.

The first case involves a small content marketing firm that used AI to help its management team envision possible future scenarios for strategic planning. The AI provided detailed potential scenarios, enabling the team to deeply discuss and plan for possible futures.

The second case is about a company that customizes trucks. The CEO used AI to generate strategic options to save the business when their supplier unexpectedly increased prices by 30%. The AI provided six ways the business could mitigate the impact, including negotiating with the supplier, diversifying product offerings, and investing in innovation and technology.

Lastly, a small-scale winemaking business in Australia used AI to diversify its business when China imposed a hefty tariff on Australian wines. The AI served as a strategy research assistant to explore potential export markets and find new local opportunities.

All three examples indicate how AI can provide SMEs with innovative strategies, strategic options during crises, and even help in exploring new markets or facilitating complete business reinvention.
