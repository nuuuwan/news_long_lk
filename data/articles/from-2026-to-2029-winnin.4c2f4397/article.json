    "Can Sajith channel his father sufficiently to win in three years?",
    "Namal must clear wreckage of three defeats in three years",
    "Quality US periodicals are running cover stories of the front runners in the 2028 Presidential race and the campaign strategy of JD Vance. It is time that Sri Lankans began discussing our 2029 race.",
    "Realistically, the choice in 2029 is between the two Opposition front-runners Sajith Premadasa and Namal Rajapaksa. From now on in, our primary political considerations should be:",
    "I. Who has the knowledge and best policies to extricate us from the \u2018twin traps\u2019 comprising the debt-poverty nexus, through simultaneous rapid growth and upliftment of the unprecedented numbers in multidimensional poverty?",
    "II. Who is the best Gladiator to fight President Anura Dissanayake (or any substitute candidate) and the increasingly autocratic, latently totalitarian JVP-NPP in the politico-electoral arena and defeat them?",
    "Sajith leads in I, Namal in II.",
    "For Sajith to win in 2029",
    "Sajith must place the SJB on a competitive footing able to generate and win the decisive populist \u2018swing vote\u2019.",
    "Even after the UNP was defeated in 1956 by SWRD Bandaranaike, creating the island\u2019s two-party system, there was no rethinking and reorientation. Therefore, though re-elected to office in 1965, the UNP was swept away in 1970 resulting in the first ever Government with a 2/3rds majority in Parliament. That shock caused a three-way fissure in the UNP between the Senanayake faction, J. R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa. Premadasa\u2019s was the most conspicuous rebellion, with:",
    "A new developmental \u2018Third Paradigm\u2019 (his April 1973 Colombo West Rotary Club lecture).",
    "The first Populist formation from within the UNP camp, the Puravesi Peramuna, or Citizens\u2019 Front.",
    "With Dudley Senanayake\u2019s death, the assumption of leadership by J. R. Jayewardene, and his invitation to Premadasa to return to the party and radically restructure it, the UNP was soon transformed by an alliance of two elements, primarily the ideas of J. R., secondarily those of Premadasa. This ideological bloc turned the post-Senanayake UNP facing the tough, authoritarian UF Government, into a populist-democratic formation, a national mass movement waging democratic struggles which included peaceful direct action in the streets (\u2018Satyagraha\u2019). It is this radically reconfigured, socially repositioned UNP that smashed through the UF Coalition Government and paid it back for the 2/3rds defeat of 1970 with a 5/6ths victory in 1977.",
    "The 1977 Government followed the Open Economy model of rapid capitalist modernisation of President Jayewardene and his Ministers. The populist Premadasa was \u2018contained\u2019 by making him a Prime Minister with \u201cthe powers of a peon\u201d (his words). For 10 years he warned prophetically that while the Open Economy was more progressive than the pre-1977 \u2018closed economy\u2019, the existing lopsided policy model was accelerating socioeconomic inequity and re-kindling youth rebellion.",
    "As the Second Southern uprising besieged the Establishment, Premadasa was poised to run for President as an independent. However, given Ranjan Wijeratne\u2019s vehement insistence, JR conceded the UNP presidential candidacy to Premadasa. From his winning 1988 election Manifesto to his death by Tiger suicide-bomber in May 1993, Premadasa led the country and the party according to his progressive developmentalist paradigm, thanks to which the UNP which was almost physically extinguished in 1987-88, revived and never lost an election on his watch.",
    "The \u2018long decline\u2019 and structural shrinkage of the UNP began with the LTTE\u2019s assassination of Premadasa, because the post-Premadasa UNP leadership extending from designated successor President D. B. Wijetunga through Presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake (surviving leader of the anti-Premadasa DUNF), to \u2018forever leader\u2019 Ranil Wickremesinghe, abandoned President Premadasa\u2019s policies which would have kept the UNP electorally ahead for many years, and replaced them with a neoliberal policy platform on which the UNP was serially defeated at Presidential elections and won a Parliamentary majority only twice (2001, 2015) with a 15-year interval.",
    "Sajith Premadasa who joined the UNP in 1994 during \u2018de-Premadasaisation\u2019, didn\u2019t wage an inner-party struggle to restore Premadasa policies \u2013 not merely for \u2018democratisation\u2019\u2013 even when the party was undeniably in shrinkage.",
    "As founder-leader of the SJB, Sajith didn\u2019t reverse de-Premadasaisation and base his party on Premadasa policies just as the SLFP had been successively and successfully based on \u2018Bandaranaike policies\u2019 and \u2018Mahinda Chinthanaya\u2019, and the JVP on Wijeweera. The UNP and its SJB successor returned to pre-Premadasa economic policies which Premadasa had held responsible for turning the island into \u201ca torch ablaze at both ends\u201d.",
    "The SJB economic platform, Dr. Harsha de Silva\u2019s \u2018Blueprint\u2019, was on a continuum with Ranil\u2019s austerity/structural adjustment package. That cost Sajith and the SJB the 2024 elections, Presidential and Parliamentary. Against a backdrop of extreme austerity, Sajith\u2019s and the SJB\u2019s 2024 election campaigns did not remind voters of the sweeping \u2018growth with equity\u2019 programs of President Premadasa which swiftly and tangibly uplifted huge numbers of citizens and areas. Instead, the SJB economic troika and Harsha de Silva\u2019s Blueprint exalted the Lilliputian economic achievements of the two Wickremesinghe administrations of 2001 and 2015-2019, \u2018achievements\u2019 which the majority of voters had rewarded with damning rejection.",
    "Sajith and the SJB ignored the opportunity provided by the fortunate coincidence of election year 2024 being the Premadasa Birth Centenary year, thereby foregoing the chance for greater traction at the grassroots, among the economically hard-pressed. Though lacking an exclusive \u2018franchise\u2019, the SJB\u2019s political academy is named after D. S. Senanayake, but there is no SJB academy for political economy, politics or national and international policy named after President Premadasa, for which Sajith possesses an exclusive \u2018franchise\u2019. Thanks to Premadasa\u2019s successors, there is no Premadasa brand, unlike the Rajapaksa and Bandaranaike brands.",
    "Despite defeat by a crushing 2/3rds majority, the SJB has neither followed the example of the post-1970 UNP defeat which effected a tectonic social shift and populist transformation in 1973-1977, nor readopted the electorally high-yield 1988-1993 Premadasa program.",
    "Recently, Dr. Harsha de Silva contradicted Sajith\u2019s apposite endorsement of the solidaristic, timely and welcome call to the IMF by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas Picketty, Yanis Varoufakis, Martin Guzman, Jayathi Ghosh et al, to cut Sri Lanka considerable slack (implying a moratorium) on debt repayment in the aftermath of the cyclone. (https://www.ft.lk/front-page/Harsha-rejects-fresh-calls-to-suspend-debt-repayments/44-786041)",
    "Sajith Premadasa implicitly cuffed his shadow Finance Minister Harsha on this issue (in Mawanella) while reiterating his support for the Stiglitz appeal.",
    "Given the \u2018social capital\u2019 of his surname, Sajith clocks one-and-a-half (2024) if not twice (2019) the SJB/UNP vote which is around 20+%. Elected on Sajith\u2019s shirt-tails, Harsha and the SJB should follow his lead, not expect him to follow theirs.",
    "SJB-UNP reunification won\u2019t necessarily furnish victory. Ranil\u2019s 2024 vote isn\u2019t mainly a UNP vote but a \u2018Cylinder\u2019 vote, which will return to Namal. Only if the SJB-UNP restore the winning Premadasa populist-developmentalist paradigm can they hope to win. Ranil should revive his 1994-1996 \u2018Premadasaist/social democratic\u2019 posture during his \u2018Sirisena Cooray/Premadasa Centre\u2019 moment.",
    "Sajith has several advantages over other Opposition leaders:",
    "A sound grasp of economics and the economic crisis.",
    "Political real-estate in Parliament and the local authorities, making him and his SJB easily the biggest shareholder of the Opposition.",
    "A higher national and international profile than all Opposition politicians.",
    "No identification with the worst aspects of the past.",
    "Sajith Premadasa might therefore be recognised in 2029 as, on balance, the less risky option for betterment.",
    "For Namal to win in 2029",
    "Namal must identify and uproot the causes for three strategic political defeats in under 10 years\u20142015, 2022, 2024\u2014which plunged the Rajapaksa political vehicle into an abyss from the peak of a two-term Mahinda Presidency.",
    "Mahinda wasn\u2019t one of those causes. It was the deviation from his policies, perspectives and practices.",
    "The \u2018nationalist\u2019 habit of misunderstanding every defeat as a conspiracy by external forces, diverts leaders from identifying the real reasons for defeats\u2014and those defeats keep recurring.",
    "In actuality, the 2015 defeat was due to:",
    "The fissure in the patriotic camp by incarceration of Sarath Fonseka, which was overkill since he had already been politically vanquished at the 2010 Presidential election.",
    "The removal of the successful 2009 UNHRC Sri Lankan representation in Geneva, leading to serial defeats in 2011, 2012, 2013, emboldening the Opposition by demonstrating that the \u2018unbeatable\u2019 Rajapaksa Government was being defeated externally where it had once won decisively. In 2015, those triple external defeats made \u2018landfall\u2019 in Sri Lanka.",
    "Post-war Islamophobia commencing with the \u2018grease yakka\u2019 phenomenon in the East; the rise of Bodhu Bala Sena, Sihala Ravaya and Ravana Balaya; the tacit endorsement of the BBS by Gotabaya Rajapaksa in interviews and at a public ceremony; the appalling Aluthgama violence\u2014which cumulatively deleted Mahinda\u2019s and the SLFP\u2019s Muslim support. Zahran\u2019s terrorist group didn\u2019t exist before 2012/BBS/Aluthgama.",
    "The killing of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and the presence/involvement of a monitoring MP of the Defence Ministry. The intra-SLFP fissure involving Maithripala Sirisena, Rajitha Senarathna, and outreach to UK-based Chandrika, originated at Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s funeral house.",
    "The Rathupaswela killings by the military, which snapped the Sinhala Catholics\u2019 strong link with the MR presidency.",
    "Sajin Vaas Gunawardena\u2019s assault (championing a favourite female Ambassador) on High Commissioner Chris Nonis, which alienated the urban upper-middle classes (and Christians).",
    "None of these originated with Mahinda Rajapaksa and are traceable to other in-house power-centres, but MR paid the electoral price.",
    "Namal has to win the bulk of the Aragalaya-generation youth vote, for which he must delete the conspiracy theories.",
    "How can \u2018external conspiracy\u2019 be explained:",
    "The extreme, state-bankrupting tax-cut, instead of reducing indirect taxes while increasing direct taxes on the super-rich.",
    "The overnight, island-wide ban on chemical fertilizer-weedicide-pesticide.",
    "Altering ratios in the composition of the contents of gas cylinders, causing fatal explosions which were then blamed on citizen/consumer carelessness.",
    "Repayment of interest on ISBs despite accurate warnings of shortages because of the paucity of dollars left over for import of essentials including fuel.",
    "The forced, unilateral 24hr burning of the bodies of dead Muslims during COVID, which was not the global norm.",
    "If the Aragalaya had been an external conspiracy, there\u2019d have been:",
    "Pro-Gotabaya demonstrations from within the majority community and support from the base of the armed forces. Instead, there were demonstrations against him by the Southern farmers who had voted for generations for the Rajapaksas, and mounting disaffection in the military camps.",
    "Support for the ousted GR presidency/the SLPP, disapproval of the Aragalaya, at the 2024 elections. Instead, the Aragalaya mood became a mandate; the Pohottuwa was crushed.",
    "Public sympathy for the ousted GR\u2014which was conspicuously absent, unlike the outpouring of solidarity for the defeated MR (2015).",
    "Who and what derailed the Rajapaksas and SLPP, when, how?",
    "1. There were far too many Rajapaksas in Parliament, perceived as accessing a disproportionately large share of resources. The ruling party was a clan-based oligarchy.",
    "2. From 2012, there was a Far-Right political operation to project Gotabaya and subtract the credit due to Mahinda\u2014e.g., the book entitled \u2018Gota\u2019s War\u2019 (i.e., neither Mahinda\u2019s nor SF\u2019s!).",
    "3. While Gotabaya was on the correct track between 2016-2017 (e.g. Viyath Maga I), a drastic shift took place by mid-2018 (Viyath Maga II, Shangri-la Hotel). It was a power grab or directional deviation by a Far-Right ultranationalist clique placing GR on ideological and policy rails very different from Mahinda\u2019s progressivism. Mahinda voiced his disapproval and annoyance over speakers and content from the next morning. The Mahinda-Maithripala centrist convergence was MR\u2019s response to the right-wing shift.",
    "4. Meant to be kept by Basil Rajapaksa on centre-left \u2018Mahinda Chinthanaya\u2019 rails, the SLPP was instead opened up by him in 2018-2019 to ultranationalist Gotabaya ideology and lectures by the extremist GR clique.",
    "5. The Mahinda comeback project aimed to make MR the powerful Prime Minister as per the 19th Amendment, guiding Gotabaya who had zero experience as legislator or political party leader. But GR\u2019s 20th Amendment shrank the power of the Prime Minister back to \u201cthat of a peon\u201d (Premadasa). With MR constitutionally crippled, Gotabaya\u2019s policies went off the rails, triggering the Aragalaya.",
    "In 2026 Namal Rajapaksa has a rare confluence of anniversaries:",
    "The 90th anniversary of the election of D. M. Rajapaksa to the Second State Council (1936).",
    "The 75th anniversary of the founding of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1951 with D. A. Rajapaksa as a co-founder.",
    "The 70th anniversary of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike\u2019s 1956 \u2018Silent Revolution\u2019.",
    "In 1951 D. A. Rajapaksa accompanied S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike into Opposition and co-founded the centre-left SLFP. Lakshman Rajapaksa had been elected to parliament in 1947 on the Communist Party ticket. Collectively and historically the Rajapaksas were progressive democrats, pro-peasant populists, centre-leftists, and patriots. In foreign affairs, George and Lakshman Rajapaksa were heavily pro-Soviet. Mahinda Rajapaksa headed the Palestine Solidarity Committee.",
    "The left-oriented, peasant-embedded, Southern populist Rajapaksa roots had nothing to do with Nalin de Silva-Gunadasa Amarasekara \u2018Jathika Chinthanaya\u2019. As Nalin underscored scornfully, SWRD\u2019s SLFP was a liberal, social democratic party from its founding in 1951 through the General Election of 1952 through to 1955, which adopted Sinhala Only due to the pressure of ultranationalist Sinhala civil society caucuses in the Buddha Jayanthi year 1955 with the 1956 General Election imminent.",
    "Gotabaya and his network were extremist \u2018outliers\u2019 in relation to the Rajapaksa mainstream. If they ever return to governmental office or influence policy, Sri Lanka will be internationally isolated and the \u2018war crimes/genocide/Tamil Eelam\u2019 call of the Tamil diaspora\u2019s Gen Z, globally boosted. With AKD retrenching our military, an Indo-US military footprint in Trincomalee could do the carve-out.",
    "For Namal to win in 2029, his team must have a qualitatively better profile than the Pohottuwa crew rejected by the Aragalaya. He must convince the voters that he has erected a firewall against the worst policies, practices and personalities of the Rajapaksa past.\u00a0 If voters think Namal will restore the Rajapaksas or return Sri Lanka to the bad side of Rajapaksa rule, they\u2019ll keep him out of the presidency for another term.",
    "Namal carries the same burden that Chandrika did in 1994 of a very unpopular Government (1970-77) headed by a family member (her mother), the very memory of which kept the SLFP out of power for 17 years. In Namal\u2019s case it is the disastrous presidency of uncle Gota. Chandrika solved her problem by brilliant re-branding with Mangala Samaraweera and Victor Ivan in 1991-1994, and when in office, with Lakshman Kadirgamar and GL Peiris. Namal has one advantage over Chandrika: she had to disown the policies of her mother, while Namal can embrace the policies of his father.",
    "Namal\u2019s \u2018To-Do\u2019 List should be:",
    "A. Pivot the SLPP away from those in Opposition politics who misled Gotabaya into thinking he was better than Mahinda.",
    "B. Return the SLPP to the head of the centre-left mainstream and progressive populism of the Rajapaksa political tradition.",
    "C. Restore Mahinda\u2019s 2005 and 2010 multiethnic, multireligious (Muslim, Catholic/Christian) support.",
    "D. Refuse nomination and National List entry to Rajapaksa family members.",
    "E. Guarantee voters that Sajin Vass Gunawardena or a substitute won\u2019t be Presidential Advisor on International Relations, and those who persecuted Dr Shafi won\u2019t be in office.",
    "Chandrika Bandaranaike cut away from the SLFP\u2019s \u201c17-Year Curse\u201d in just 3 years, 1991-1994. In 1994, she won as \u2018Chandrika\u2019 or \u2018CBK\u2019, giving the SLFP a brand-new look, not restoration of Bandaranaikes or return to the Sirimavo years. Namal must learn from CBK\u2019s successful 1994 move. He too has (just) three years.",
