By converting surplus renewable energy into hydrogen, Sri Lanka could effectively create a massive energy storage mechanism

Looming crisis of fossil fuel scarcity: Will Sri Lanka brace or buckle?

By Lt. Col (Retd) Athula Samarasinghe

A palpable chill hangs in the global air, carrying whispers of a looming energy crisis – a spectre that darkens the prospects of nations shackled to the increasingly perilous embrace of fossil fuels. As the world teeters on the precipice of potential and perhaps inevitable fossil fuel shortages, a critical and urgent question echoes across Sri Lanka and other similarly dependent nations: how will we, as an island nation, navigate this unfolding and potentially devastating storm?

A disturbing intuition stirs within me, suggesting a descent into a ‘COVID mentality’ on a far grander scale – a world where narrow self-interest eclipses the imperative of collective action, and the most powerful nations engage in a ruthless scramble for increasingly scarce resources. But is this dystopian future an imminent threat, a mere stone’s throw away, or a distant, avoidable possibility? And if the signs point to its rapid approach, what precious little time remains for Sri Lanka to fortify its defences, to chart a resilient and independent course?

The cold calculus of survival in such a scenario demands profoundly difficult choices, sacrifices that may yield no immediate gratification, testing our collective willingness to forgo present comforts for the uncertain dawn of our children’s future. As Sri Lankans, facing the stark realities of our reliance and our vulnerability, are we truly prepared to make such a profound leap into the unknown, to embrace the necessary transformations before the gathering storm breaks?

The very origins of coal and oil are etched in the deep annals of geological time, a slow, almost imperceptible ballet played out over eons. The compressed remnants of ancient swamp vegetation, subjected to unimaginable pressure and heat, yielded the carbonaceous rock we know as coal. Simultaneously, microscopic marine organisms, entombed beneath millennia of sediment, underwent a profound transformation into the liquid gold of crude oil. This protracted genesis underscores a fundamental truth: on a human timescale, these energy sources are inherently finite.

Despite the burgeoning rise of renewable energy technologies, our global reliance on these ancient fuels continues its troubling ascent, stubbornly fuelled by their entrenched role in transportation and power generation and often propelled by short-sighted economic considerations. This stark imbalance paints a deeply concerning picture: we are engaged in the rapid depletion of resources forged over millions of years. Current, sobering estimates suggest that our known reserves of oil and natural gas could be largely exhausted within the next half-century. Even coal, the most abundant of these ancient stores, faces significant depletion within the next century and a half. The clock, it seems, is not just ticking; it’s counting down with an unsettling and accelerating urgency, demanding a fundamental shift in our energy paradigm before time runs out.

For an island nation like Sri Lanka, tethered to the diminishing lifeline of fossil fuel reserves, the immediate pangs of economic anxiety cast a long shadow, threatening to obscure the crucial long-term horizon. Our current financial fragility creates a powerful gravitational pull towards the urgent needs of day-to-day survival, potentially blinding us to the strategic imperatives of the decades to come.

However, truly contemplating Sri Lanka’s energy landscape a half-century from now demands a rare form of courage – a steadfast commitment that transcends the immediate clamour of the present crisis. To envision a sustainable energy future stretching a century and a half into the distance requires something more profound than mere pragmatic intellect can readily grasp; it necessitates a visionary leap.

The seemingly sensible allure of stockpiling oil to navigate the next 50 years, or even embracing coal cloaked in the promise of carbon capture for the century beyond, offers only a fleeting and ultimately false sense of security. These are finite solutions with inherent environmental and economic liabilities. The true challenge, the one that demands our unwavering focus and boldest imagination, lies in envisioning a Sri Lanka thriving in a world entirely beyond these increasingly archaic timelines. We must dare to look beyond the barrel and the mine, towards a truly sustainable energy future for generations to come.

Where global shifts meet local fragility

For Sri Lanka, an island nation acutely vulnerable to the shifting tides of global policy and the relentless force of nature, the path forward is fraught with peril. We stand at a critical juncture, squeezed between the undeniable global momentum towards net-zero emissions – a transition that carries potential economic consequences for our existing carbon footprint – and the increasingly stark reality of a climate in crisis demanding immediate and costly resilience measures.

Compounding this dual pressure is the precarious state of our national treasury, a hand-to-mouth existence that leaves little room for long-term strategic investment. This already fragile situation is further undermined by the dangerous rhetoric that dismisses global warming as a mere ‘myth,’ a denial that directly threatens our ability to prepare for and mitigate the very real impacts we are already experiencing.

Sri Lanka’s predicament, therefore, is undeniably complex and acutely felt. We are a nation caught in a vise: grappling with the immediate demands of economic survival while simultaneously facing the looming and unavoidable demands of a sustainable future in a world grappling with climate change – a future some still choose to ignore. This isn’t just an environmental challenge; it’s an economic, social, and existential one for our island nation.

Unlocking hydrogen’s promise for Sri Lanka

For over half a decade, my scientific curiosity has been laser-focused on a single, transformative element: hydrogen. My investigation has been driven by the profound potential I see for it to fundamentally reshape Sri Lanka’s energy landscape. What initially struck me as a curious paradox was the stark contrast in its public perception. This same element that propelled humanity to the moon, a symbol of immense power and controlled energy, is often shadowed by the destructive imagery of the hydrogen bomb. This duality – creation versus destruction – ignited a deeper inquiry into how Sri Lanka, uniquely blessed with a wealth of renewable energy resources, could pivot away from this destructive association and instead harness hydrogen’s immense promise as a clean energy carrier. My exploration has become a quest to understand how this island nation can leverage its natural advantages to forge a path towards genuine energy independence, powered by the very element that fuels the stars.

The core narrative of hydrogen, stripped down to its essence, is strikingly accessible – a scientific principle many of us unknowingly witnessed in our formative years. Recall the simple school lab experiment: two wires, a battery, and a container of water. Immerse those wires – one connected to the positive terminal, the other to the negative – and watch as tiny bubbles emerge. That seemingly elementary process, known as electrolysis or water splitting, is the foundational act of liberating hydrogen from its bond with oxygen.

What elevates hydrogen beyond a mere scientific curiosity is its remarkable adaptability. It transcends the traditional definition of a fuel, capable not only of propelling vehicles and generating heat but also serving as a crucial building block in diverse industrial applications. Furthermore, hydrogen possesses the unique ability to act as an energy storage medium. Excess energy, particularly from intermittent renewable sources, can be used to produce hydrogen, which can then be stored and reconverted into electricity when demand arises.

Perhaps most compelling is the elegant simplicity of its energy conversion. When hydrogen is used to generate electricity, its sole byproduct is pure water – a clean circle, leaving no harmful emissions in its wake. This inherent cleanliness positions hydrogen as a potentially transformative solution in our quest for a sustainable energy future.

My own fascination with hydrogen was further ignited by a fundamental truth: its sheer abundance. As the most prevalent element in the universe, hydrogen is not a resource confined by geographical boundaries or geopolitical leverage. It is, in its raw form, universally accessible to every nation on Earth. This inherent democratic nature of its origin holds profound implications for energy independence and global collaboration in the pursuit of a cleaner world.

Decoding the environmental impact of hydrogen production

Here’s a fundamental truth often glossed over in the burgeoning hydrogen narrative: while hydrogen itself is ubiquitous – a basic element woven into the very fabric of our world, even the air we inhale – the readily usable form of hydrogen fuel is anything but naturally occurring. Think of it like precious metals locked within ore; we have to expend energy to extract it.

And this extraction process is where the critical distinctions, and the now-famous ‘hydrogen colour code,’ come into play. The energy source we use to liberate hydrogen dictates its environmental impact and, ultimately, its viability as a truly clean fuel.

Produce hydrogen using the power of the sun or the wind, to generate ‘green hydrogen’ – the gold standard, the truly sustainable option. But today, the lion’s share of hydrogen produced is ‘gray hydrogen,’ extracted using fossil fuels, essentially negating its clean potential at the point of use with significant carbon emissions at the point of production.

Another shade is ‘blue hydrogen’ – often touted as a cleaner alternative. In reality, it’s fundamentally ‘gray hydrogen’ dressed up with carbon capture technology. While capturing emissions is a step in the right direction, it’s an added cost and not a perfect solution.

For now, ‘gray hydrogen’ holds the dubious title of being the cheapest to produce. ‘Blue hydrogen’ follows closely behind, its cost slightly elevated by the carbon capture process. However, a significant shift is underway. The plummeting costs of solar and wind energy are rapidly closing the price gap with ‘blue hydrogen,’ making ‘green hydrogen’ an increasingly competitive and, crucially, a genuinely sustainable pathway forward.

While ‘green hydrogen’ hasn’t yet reached price parity with its ‘gray’ counterpart, the trajectory is clear. The economic and environmental scales are tipping. Understanding this color-coded reality is paramount to discerning genuine clean energy solutions from clever marketing. The future of a truly sustainable hydrogen economy hinges on our ability to scale up the production of truly green hydrogen, and fast.

Beyond theory: Real-world perspectives from the hydrogen vanguard

For the past several years, my deep dive into the complexities of hydrogen has been significantly shaped by an exclusive network operating largely outside the mainstream headlines: “Mission Hydrogen.” Founded by Dr. David Wanger, a name synonymous with over two decades of pioneering work in hydrogen and renewable energy – his fingerprints are on more than 800 projects worldwide – this isn’t just another industry forum. It’s a vital confluence of scientific minds, hydrogen technology practitioners, and passionate advocates.

My involvement with “Mission Hydrogen” has proven to be an invaluable bridge between academic understanding and the often-messy realities of real-world implementation. Within this dynamic space, the theoretical debates surrounding hydrogen are constantly tested and refined by the lived experiences of those on the front lines. I’ve gained unfiltered access to critical insights into the roadblocks hindering widespread hydrogen adoption, the genuine trends shaping the industry, the rigorous safety standards being developed and enforced, the effectiveness of established technologies versus nascent claims, the scope of ongoing hydrogen initiatives across the globe, and the tangible performance metrics of various hydrogen applications.

Leading this crucial exchange is Dr. Wanger, whose dedication transcends professional engagement. His frustration with the perceived inertia in the global transition towards a hydrogen economy is palpable, born from years of hands-on experience and a deep-seated belief in its potential. Notably, Dr. Wanger isn’t just implementing hydrogen projects; he’s living a hydrogen-powered lifestyle, a testament to his profound conviction. The recent geopolitical turbulence and the seemingly slow pace of global net-zero progress have understandably cast a shadow of doubt for some.

However, for my own investigative journey over the past two years, “Mission Hydrogen” has served as an indispensable compass, sharpening my focus and reinforcing my determination to champion a green hydrogen economy specifically tailored for Sri Lanka’s unique context. This network, fuelled by Dr. Wanger’s unwavering commitment and the collective expertise of its members, represents a critical, often overlooked, force in the global pursuit of a cleaner energy future. Their insights are not just valuable; they are essential for anyone seeking to truly understand the promise and the pathways of hydrogen

While the developed world largely charts its own disparate courses toward a hydrogen economy, a fascinating divergence is emerging. Despite the headwinds of geopolitical instability and a seemingly glacial global march towards net-zero emissions, nations like Japan and South Korea are demonstrably doubling down on hydrogen.

Intriguingly, the automotive giant Toyota presents a particularly compelling case study. In a market increasingly dominated by battery electric vehicles, their conspicuous absence from the BEV vanguard, coupled with their bold embrace of hydrogen fuel cell technology and even hydrogen combustion engines, raises critical questions. Given Toyota’s reputation for meticulous research and strategic foresight, one must assume their conviction is rooted in something deeper than mere contrarianism.

Indeed, the prevailing scientific narrative often casts hydrogen as economically unsustainable when viewed solely as an energy carrier for transport or electricity generation. However, a growing body of evidence suggests a paradigm shift: the true economic viability and sustainability of hydrogen may lie in its integrated application – where it serves simultaneously as an energy vector and a direct fuel source for transportation.

Could this integrated perspective be the key to Toyota’s seemingly unconventional strategy? Are they privy to data or insights that position hydrogen not as a niche alternative, but as a cornerstone of a future energy ecosystem? This warrants closer scrutiny. The world may be fixated on the electric vehicle race, but perhaps Japan, South Korea, and Toyota are playing a longer, more complex game with hydrogen as their ace in the hole.

A tailored path for Sri Lanka’s energy independence

Amidst global debates on hydrogen’s role, Sri Lanka’s unique circumstances present a compelling and potentially groundbreaking strategy. Rather than simply mirroring the approaches of industrialised nations, the island nation appears to be eyeing a distinct advantage rooted in its abundant renewable energy resources.

The core of this vision lies in a clever synergy: leveraging renewable energy not just for immediate consumption, but as a means to generate and store hydrogen. This dual-purpose approach directly tackles the inherent challenges of renewable energy – its intermittency and variability. By converting surplus renewable energy into hydrogen, Sri Lanka could effectively create a massive energy storage mechanism.

But the ambition doesn’t end there. The same stored hydrogen could then be strategically deployed as a clean fuel source for heavy transportation – a sector notoriously difficult to decarbonise. This integrated model – renewable energy powering hydrogen production for both grid stabilisation and transport fuel – offers a potentially elegant solution tailored to Sri Lanka’s specific context.

Unlocking Sri Lanka’s hydrogen equation: A blueprint for global impact

The crucial questions now are: What is the scale of Sri Lanka’s renewable energy surplus? What are the technological and economic feasibility studies underpinning this vision? And what safeguards are in place to ensure sustainable and cost-effective hydrogen production? If executed effectively, Sri Lanka’s approach could serve as a powerful case study for other nations seeking to maximise their renewable energy potential while simultaneously addressing the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions. This is a story worth watching closely.
