- The IMF made a significant positive contribution to Sri Lanka through a focus on governance and anti-corruption resulting in an excellent Governance Diagnostic Assessment.
- Verité Research maintains the IMF Tracker, which keeps track of progress in the IMF program in Sri Lanka on a monthly basis.
- The Tracker has three categories: “Met”, “Unknown”, and “Not Met” for different actions. It recently reported one action as "met" that the IMF reviewed as "not met", concerning the allocation of 0.6% of GDP to Social Spending.
- The second IMF Review found several discrepancies with the Tracker's assessments, evaluating at least 14 actions as “Not-Met”; including 3 actions that the Tracker classified as “Unknown”. It also made objective mistakes, assessing 4 transparency and anti-corruption-related actions as “Met” when they were not.
- For 16 actions evaluated as "Not Met" by the Tracker, the IMF agrees or remains silent for 10 actions, evaluates 4 wrongly as "Met", and the remaining 2 “Not-Met” actions by the Tracker are cabinet decisions where the information available differences could not be reconciled.

Opinions:

- The author declares that the IMF’s recent review has discrepancies and has made serious objective mistakes in terms of anti-corruption and transparency actions.
- The author believes the IMF was mistaken in evaluating 4 of 6 commitments as “Met” despite them being objectively “Not-Met” by the due date, June 12, and suggests the IMF review should have been more explicit about the discrepancies.
- The article writers express concern over the changes and errors in the IMF's assessment methods, suggesting it falls short of Sri Lanka's own laws on information disclosure and is relieved of its reporting requirement for the future. They posit this is not the best course if the goal is to improve governance.
- The IMF's use of vague language to refer to the action plan published by the Government, omitted two key anti-corruption requirements, is seen by the author as a likely intentional evasive tactic.
- Concern is expressed over the IMF Review's silence on the failure of two Structural Benchmarks, with the authors strongly suggesting that these actions were objectively not met.
