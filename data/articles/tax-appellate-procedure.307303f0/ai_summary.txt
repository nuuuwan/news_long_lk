2. 🗂️ The tax assessment process begins with an inquiry, which may include interviews and document requests. An assessment may be issued if the declared tax liability is found to be incorrect. 
3. 😠 Frustrated taxpayers can appeal through a four-tier system, starting from the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) and ending at the Supreme Court. 
4. ⏱️ Adhering to deadlines is crucial in tax matters. Assessments issued beyond the timeframe could be challenged and potentially overturned. Missing deadlines could lead to taxpayers losing appeal rights. 
5. 🤔 The taxpayer holds the burden of proof to show that a tax assessment from the CGIR is excessive. The CGIR, however, has to justify the imposition of penalties. 
6. ⚖️ Taxpayer rights have been reduced in recent policy changes. For example, previously taxpayers had a 30-month window to amend tax returns, which is now only 12 months. 
7. 💼 Under a 2024 Budget proposal, the submission of evidence at the Tax Appeals Commission may be restricted. Failure to provide documents during specific timeframes will prevent these documents from being submitted during the appeal process. 
8. 💰 To appeal, taxpayers must currently provide a substantial financial security, which can block access to justice, especially for those with limited resources.
9. 🌀 Sri Lanka's tax appeals process faces challenges due to understaffing within the tax authority, contributing to delays in assessments and unfair administrative reviews. 
10. 🏢Proposed changes include shortening assessment timelines, moving towards online hearing procedures and evidence submission, and the establishment of a tax ombudsman and special tax appeals court for efficient and fair tax processes.
