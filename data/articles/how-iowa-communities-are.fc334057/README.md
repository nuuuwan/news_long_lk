Quiet quitting. Return to office. The Great Resignation. Work-related jargon has made its way into mainstream discussions more than ever before.

That may be because boundaries between work and life have eroded lately. With many people still working remotely, constant connectivity through digital devices, and a widespread hustle culture, the ability to separate one’s job from one’s personal pursuits has become problematic.

As Americans try to reclaim a more balanced lifestyle, one helpful approach is to turn stale work-related phrases on their heads. By reframing these clichés, we can make people the focus once again.

The concept of work-life balance has existed for decades. But in recent years, Americans not only have gotten more comfortable with discussing it openly but also are demanding it become a reality.

Instead, why don’t we talk about life-work balance? This reconfiguration puts the focus on quality of life. Advocating for life-work balance reminds us that there’s more to life than putting work first.

Lori Chesser, a shareholder in the Dentons Davis Brown law firm in Des Moines, Iowa, agrees with this rephrasing. After studying in Georgia, she returned to Iowa to be closer to family and make a difference in her community—while also making the most of her life outside work.

Lori landed in Des Moines not only because of the opportunity with her firm but also because of the city’s high rankings for work-life balance and as a top place to live in the U.S. She enjoys the harmony between its thriving downtown, scenic parks, and focus on collaboration and community.

Getting promoted at work doesn’t always go as hoped or happen on an ideal schedule. But instead of just climbing the corporate ladder, professionals could give their lives a promotion with more spending money, more affordable homes, more time to spend doing the things they love, and a better quality of life.

Iowa’s Cedar Valley region, including the cities of Waterloo and Cedar Falls, offers a cost of living more than 13% more affordable than the national average. It’s also home to educational powerhouses like the University of Northern Iowa, along with strong K-12 schools and community and private colleges that have infused new energy into the area. The region’s diverse populations create a unique culture that includes eye-popping art installations and historic downtown districts.

And a short commute leaves more time for getting the most out of the day. The average commute for Charles City residents is just 10 minutes; even in larger Des Moines, it clocks in at just over 17 minutes. A short commute also leaves more money in residents’ pockets and more time for family, friends, and hobbies—and for those new to the area, that change in life-work balance may feel like a promotion.

The concept of quiet quitting introduced the idea of doing just enough to get by at work, usually as a reaction to frustration and stress. A more zen approach is quiet quieting.

Iowa may bring to mind cornfields and farmland. But the state is also home to stunning rolling hills, prairies, waterfalls, rivers, bluffs, and more than 2,500 miles of trails—a tranquil retreat from the daily grind. “It’s so peaceful,” said Roger White, volunteer coordinator with Cedar Valley Trail Partnership. “You sit back, hear the birds and the insects, and enjoy nature.”

A combination of culture and nature makes a perfect backdrop for quiet quieting. In Charles City, the picturesque Cedar River cuts through the center of town, supporting stress-relieving activities such as fishing, paddleboarding, and whitewater rafting and serving as a stunning backdrop for the community’s art scene, with two inspiring art centers. The Mooney Art Gallery features works by Rembrandt, Dali, and Picasso, and the city boasts an impressive collection of public art.

A number of firms are promoting a return to office (RTO) after many workers went remote during the pandemic. But a return to outdoors is a more appealing take on the acronym.

With urban parks in Des Moines, a hundred miles of trails in the Cedar Valley, and biking and riverside strolls in Charles City, outdoor activities can be found in every region of Iowa, making it a draw for cyclists, hikers, and anyone who likes fresh air and sunshine.

The city of Ames enjoys a robust economy and cultural scene and is home to the renowned Iowa State University. This college town also offers 38 parks, 55 miles of bike trails, more than 15 area golf courses, and nearly 200 wellness programs curated by the city’s Parks and Recreation Department.

As long as Americans are rethinking their relationship with their jobs, we would be wise to strive for life-work balance. Regardless of the terminology, the status quo of overwork and an always-on mentality are no longer acceptable.

That’s exactly what Kate Willer thought when she was searching for a state that offers a more balanced lifestyle and found Iowa. “When you stop and take a breath, you realize you’re just working and grinding while missing out on things,” she said. “But in Iowa, everyone has a better sense of enjoying their life while still having a great work ethic.”
