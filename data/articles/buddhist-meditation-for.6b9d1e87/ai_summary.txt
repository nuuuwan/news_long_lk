Meditation has become a $2 billion industry in the US, with 14% of adults stating that they have participated in meditation at least once in their lifetime. The aim, according to Buddhism, is to gain insight into the true nature of the body, perception, mind and moral governing factors. Meanwhile, there is a call for the new, technologically savvy generation to use their understanding of science to further their studies within Buddhism. Those schooled in modern technology have the unique opportunity to convert information into knowledge and then into wisdom, or insight, a form of meditation in itself. While earlier generations had to rely on perceptions and logical inferences to understand the universe, today 's technologically advanced society can use experimental methods to achieve the same understanding.
