Defence counsel Anura Meddegoda, PC, informed the court that his client had never been convicted of any crime. He further stated that his client is a social activist and a mother of three children. He requested that the court consider these mitigating factors to impose a lenient sentence.

Hirunika to seek bail on Monday

Former Colombo District Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra, who has been jailed for three years by the High Court of Colombo for her involvement in the abduction of a youth using a Defender, is expected to seek bail from the Colombo High Court.
