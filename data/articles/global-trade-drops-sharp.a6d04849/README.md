Global trade drops sharply amid soaring tariffs

ContextSingapore’s highly open economy and its role as a global trade and logistics hub make it particularly vulnerable to shifts in international trade dynamics. Under the new US president, Donald Trump, the global economic landscape is poised for upheaval. The previous Trump administration (2017–2021) implemented protectionist trade policies, including imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and favouring bilateral trade agreements over multilateral deals. In April 2025 the Trump administration announced wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs of various levels on many economies (10% for Singapore). In response, major powers such as China have retaliated with a 34% tariff on US goods. These actions have reignited trade tensions and led to significant volatility in the financial markets.TriggerThe imposition of tariffs between the US and other major economies could escalate into a full-scale trade war. Mr Trump has shown no signs of backing down after China’s retaliation and has imposed more than 100% tariffs on that country. Should the EU follow in the footsteps of China, global trade tensions could widen into a multi-front economic conflict. Additional flash points, including targeted US export controls, retaliatory non-tariff barriers, or further currency volatility, could compound macroeconomic instability, especially for trade-dependent economies like Singapore.ImpactA further escalation in trade protectionism would carry significant consequences for Singapore’s export-oriented economy, which is deeply intertwined with global trade flows. Major sectors—including electronics, wholesale trade and financial services—will be hit by weakening external demand, supply-chain disruptions and higher operational costs. A sustained downturn in global trade volumes would probably drag on GDP growth, dampen business sentiment and slow hiring, especially in trade-exposed industries. Firms reliant on integrated global supply chains may face production delays and cost inflation, while broader economic uncertainty could deter both domestic and foreign investment. Financial markets could also react negatively to ongoing US policy unpredictability, potentially undermining Singapore’s position as a stable financial hub. Moreover, if Mr Trump intensifies scrutiny on South-east Asian countries considered transshipment points for Chinese goods, companies may divert their operations to other markets—such as Japan, Australia, or India—to avoid political risk. This could erode Singapore’s standing as a world-class trading and re-export hub.MitigationSingapore’s government will continue diversifying its trade partners, focusing on emerging markets, and deepening ties within South-east Asia and beyond. Strengthening regional co-operation through frameworks like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and pursuing new free-trade agreements can help to mitigate some of the fallout from US-centric trade policies. Businesses should invest in making their supply chains more resilient, possibly through securing alternative suppliers.The ongoing impact of Trump’s tariffs is fuelling uncertainty and organisations with integrated global supply chains risk production delays and cost inflation. Furthermore, broader economic instability could stifle domestic and foreign investment globally.Join EIU’s experts at our latest webinar, Global trade under pressure, as they examine evolving international trade dynamics and discuss the trends reshaping the operating environment.
