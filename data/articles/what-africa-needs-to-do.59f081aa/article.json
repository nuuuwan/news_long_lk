    "Kessel Okinga-Koumu paced around a crowded hallway. It was her first time presenting at the Deep Learning Indaba, she told the crowd gathered to hear her, filled with researchers from Africa\u2019s machine-learning community. The annual weeklong conference (\u2018Indaba\u2019 is a Zulu word for gathering), was held most recently in September at Amadou Mahtar Mbow University in Dakar, Senegal. It attracted over 700 attendees to hear about\u2014and debate\u2014the potential of Africa-centric AI and how it\u2019s being deployed in agriculture, education, health care, and other critical sectors of the continent\u2019s economy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A 28-year-old computer science student at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town, South Africa, Okinga-Koumu spoke about how she\u2019s tackling a common problem: the lack of lab equipment at her university. Lecturers have long been forced to use chalkboards or printed 2D representations of equipment to simulate practical lessons that need microscopes, centrifuges, or other expensive tools. \u201cIn some cases, they even ask students to draw the equipment during practical lessons,\u201d she lamented.\u00a0  Okinga-Koumu pulled a phone from the pocket of her blue jeans and opened a prototype web app she\u2019s built. Using VR and AI features, the app allows students to simulate using the necessary lab equipment\u2014exploring 3D models of the tools in a real-world setting, like a classroom or lab. \u201cStudents could have detailed VR of lab equipment, making their hands-on experience more effective,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Established in 2017, the Deep Learning Indaba now has chapters in 47 of the 55 African nations and aims to boost AI development across the continent by providing training and resources to African AI researchers like Okinga-Koumu. Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies, but organizers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.",
    "\u201cThe building and ownership of AI solutions tailored to local contexts is crucial for equitable development,\u201d says Shakir Mohamed, a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and cofounder of the organization sponsoring the conference. Africa, more than other continents in the world, can address specific challenges with AI and will benefit immensely from its young talent, he says: \u201cThere is amazing expertise everywhere across the continent.\u201d\u00a0 However, researchers\u2019 ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. The biggest are inadequate funding and poor infrastructure. Not only is it very expensive to build AI systems, but research to provide AI training data in original African languages has been hamstrung by poor financing of linguistics departments at many African universities and the fact that citizens increasingly don't speak or write local languages themselves. Limited internet access and a scarcity of domestic data centers also mean that developers might not be able to deploy cutting-edge AI capabilities.",
    "DEEP LEARNING INDABA 2024   Complicating this further is a lack of overarching policies or strategies for harnessing AI\u2019s immense benefits\u2014and regulating its downsides. While there are various draft policy documents, researchers are in conflict over a continent-wide strategy. And they disagree about which policies would most benefit Africa, not the wealthy Western governments and corporations that have often funded technological innovation. Taken together, researchers worry, these issues will hold Africa\u2019s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the cusp of change Africa\u2019s researchers are already making the most of generative AI\u2019s impressive capabilities. In South Africa, for instance, to help address the HIV epidemic, scientists have designed an app called Your Choice, powered by an LLM-based chatbot that interacts with people to obtain their sexual history without stigma or discrimination. In Kenya, farmers are using AI apps \u00a0to diagnose diseases in crops and increase productivity. And in Nigeria, Awarri, a newly minted AI startup, is trying to build the country\u2019s first large language model, with the endorsement of the government, so that Nigerian languages can be integrated into AI tools.\u00a0 Related StoryThis company is building AI for African languagesAI models can\u2019t understand African languages. Lelapa AI is trying to change that.",
    "The Deep Learning Indaba is another sign of how Africa\u2019s AI research scene is starting to flourish. At the Dakar meeting, researchers presented 150 posters and 62 papers. Of those, 30 will be published in top-tier journals, according to Mohamed.\u00a0  Meanwhile, an analysis of 1,646 publications in AI between 2013 and 2022 found \u201ca significant increase in publications\u201d from Africa. And Masakhane, a cousin organization to Deep Learning Indaba that pushes for natural-language-processing research in African languages, has released over 400 open-source models and 20 African-language data sets since it was founded in 2018.\u00a0 \u201cThese metrics speak a lot to the capacity building that's happening,\u201d says Kathleen Siminyu, a computer scientist from Kenya, who researches NLP tools for her native Kiswahili. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a critical mass of people having basic foundational skills. They then go on to specialize.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s like a wave that cannot be stopped.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Khadija Ba, a Senegalese entrepreneur and investor at the pan-African VC fund P1 Ventures who was at this year\u2019s conference, says that she sees African AI startups as particularly attractive because their local approaches have potential to be scaled for the global market. African startups often build solutions in the absence of robust infrastructure, yet \u201cthese innovations work efficiently, making them adaptable to other regions facing similar challenges,\u201d she says.",
    "In recent years, funding in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem has picked up: VC investment totaled $4.5 billion last year, more than double what it was just five years ago, according to a report by the African Private Capital Association. And this October, Google announced a $5.8 million commitment to support AI training initiatives in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. But researchers say local funding remains sluggish. Take the Google-backed fund rolled out, also in October, in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country. It will pay out $6,000 each to 10 AI startups\u2014not even enough to purchase the equipment needed to power their systems. Lilian Wanzare, a lecturer and NLP researcher at Maseno University in Kisumu, Kenya, bridles at African governments\u2019 lackadaisical support for local AI initiatives and complains as well that the government charges exorbitant fees for access to publicly generated data, hindering data sharing and collaboration. \u201c[We] researchers are just blocked,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government is saying they\u2019re willing to support us, but the structures have not been put in place for us.\u201d Language barriers\u00a0 Researchers who want to make Africa-centric AI don\u2019t face just insufficient local investment and inaccessible data. There are major linguistic challenges, too.\u00a0\u00a0 During one discussion at the Indaba, Ife Adebara, a Nigerian computational linguist, posed a question: \u201cHow many people can write a bachelor\u2019s thesis in their native African language?\u201d\u00a0  Zero hands went up.\u00a0 Then the audience disintegrated into laughter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Africans want AI to speak their local languages, but many Africans cannot speak and write in these languages themselves, Adebara said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although Africa accounts for one-third of all languages in the world, many oral languages are slowly disappearing, their population of native speakers declining. And LLMs developed by Western-based tech companies fail to serve African languages; they don\u2019t understand locally relevant context and culture.",
    "For Adebara and others researching NLP tools, the lack of people who have the ability to read and write in African languages poses a major hurdle to development of bespoke AI-enabled technologies. \u201cWithout literacy in our local languages, the future of AI in Africa is not as bright as we think,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On top of all that, there\u2019s little machine-readable data for African languages. One reason is that linguistic departments in public universities are poorly funded, Adebara says, limiting linguists\u2019 participation in work that could create such data and benefit AI development.",
    "This year, she and her colleagues established EqualyzAI, a for-profit company seeking to preserve African languages through digital technology. They have built voice tools and AI models, covering about 517 African languages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lelapa AI, a software company that\u2019s building data sets and NLP tools for African languages, is also trying to address these language-specific challenges. Its cofounders met in 2017 at the first Deep Learning Indaba and launched the company in 2022. In 2023, it released its first AI tool, Vulavula, a speech-to-text program that recognizes several languages spoken in South Africa.\u00a0  This year, Lelapa AI released InkubaLM, a first-of-its-kind small language model that currently supports a range of African languages: IsiXhosa, Yoruba, Swahili, IsiZulu, and Hausa. InkubaLM can answer questions and perform tasks like English translation and sentiment analysis. In tests, it performed as well as some larger models. But it\u2019s still in early stages. The hope is that InkubaLM will someday power Vulavula, says Jade Abbott, cofounder and chief operating officer of Lelapa AI.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the first iteration of us really expressing our long-term vision of what we want, and where we see African AI in the future,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really building is a small language model that punches above its weight.\u201d InkubaLM is trained on two open-source data sets with 1.9 billion tokens, built and curated by Masakhane and other African developers who worked with real people in local communities. They paid native speakers of languages to attend writing workshops to create data for their model. Fundamentally, this approach will always be better, says Wanzare, because it\u2019s informed by people who represent the language and culture.",
    "A clash over strategy Another issue that came up again and again at the Indaba was that Africa\u2019s AI scene lacks the sort of regulation and support from governments that you find elsewhere in the world\u2014in Europe, the US, China, and, increasingly, the Middle East.\u00a0 Of the 55 African nations, only seven\u2014Senegal, Egypt, Mauritius, Rwanda, Algeria, Nigeria, and Benin\u2014have developed their own formal AI strategies. And many of those are still in the early stages.\u00a0\u00a0 A major point of tension at the Indaba, though, was the regulatory framework that will govern the approach to AI across the entire continent. In March, the African Union Development Agency published a white paper, developed over a three-year period, that lays out this strategy. The 200-page document includes recommendations for industry codes and practices, standards to assess and benchmark AI systems, and a blueprint of AI regulations for African nations to adopt. The hope is that it will be endorsed by the heads of African governments in February 2025 and eventually passed by the African Union.\u00a0\u00a0 But in July, the African Union Commission in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, another African governing body that wields more power than the development agency, released a rival continental AI strategy\u2014a 66-page document that diverges from the initial white paper.",
    "It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s behind the second strategy, but Seydina Ndiaye, a program director at the Cheikh Hamidou Kane Digital University in Dakar who helped draft the development agency\u2019s white paper, claims it was drafted by a tech lobbyist from Switzerland. The commission\u2019s strategy calls for African Union member states to declare AI a national priority, promote AI startups, and develop regulatory frameworks to address safety and security challenges. But Ndiaye expressed concerns that the document does not reflect the perspectives, aspirations, knowledge, and work of grassroots African AI communities. \u201cIt\u2019s a copy-paste of what\u2019s going on outside the continent,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vukosi Marivate, a computer scientist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa who helped found the Deep Learning Indaba and is known as an advocate for the African machine-learning movement, expressed fury over this turn of events at the conference. \u201cThese are things we shouldn\u2019t accept,\u201d he declared. The room full of data wonks, linguists, and international funders brimmed with frustration. But Marivate encouraged the group to forge ahead with building AI that benefits Africans: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for the rules to act right,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Barbara Glover, a program manager for the African Union Development Agency, acknowledges that AI researchers are angry and frustrated. There\u2019s been a push to harmonize the two continental AI strategies, but she says the process has been fractious: \u201cThat engagement didn\u2019t go as envisioned.\u201d Her agency plans to keep its own version of the continental AI strategy, Glover says, adding that it was developed by African experts rather than outsiders. \u201cWe are capable, as Africans, of driving our own AI agenda,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  DEEP LEARNING INDABA 2024   This all speaks to a broader tension over foreign influence in the African AI scene, one that goes beyond any single strategic document. Mirroring the skepticism toward the African Union Commission strategy, critics say the Deep Learning Indaba is tainted by its reliance on funding from big foreign tech companies; roughly 50% of its $500,000 annual budget comes from international donors and the rest from corporations like Google DeepMind, Apple, Open AI, and Meta. They argue that this cash could pollute the Indaba\u2019s activities and influence the topics and speakers chosen for discussion.\u00a0 But Mohamed, the Indaba cofounder who is a researcher at Google DeepMind, says that \u201calmost all that goes back to our beneficiaries across the continent,\u201d and the organization helps connect them to training opportunities in tech companies. He says it benefits from some of its cofounders\u2019 ties with these companies but that they do not set the agenda. Ndiaye says that the funding is necessary to keep the conference going. \u201cBut we need to have more African governments involved,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To Timnit Gebru, founder and executive director at the nonprofit Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), which supports equitable AI research in Africa, the angst about foreign funding for AI development comes down to skepticism of exploitative, profit-driven international tech companies. \u201cAfricans [need] to do something different and not replicate the same issues we\u2019re fighting against,\u201d Gebru says. She warns about the pressure to adopt \u201cAI for everything in Africa,\u201d adding that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of push from international development organizations\u201d to use AI as an \u201cantidote\u201d for all Africa\u2019s challenges.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Siminyu, who is also a researcher at DAIR, agrees with that view. She hopes that African governments will fund and work with people in Africa to build AI tools that reach underrepresented communities\u2014tools that can be used in positive ways and in a context that works for Africans. \u201cWe should be afforded the dignity of having AI tools in a way that others do,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hide"
