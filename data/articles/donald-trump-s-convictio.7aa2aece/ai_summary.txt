Former president Donald Trump has been found guilty on 34 counts of felony charges including falsifying business records with campaign funds, unlawfully influencing the 2016 presidential election, and committing tax fraud. The writer, Vijaya Chandrasoma, is making claims about potential future trials and outcomes for Trump, and suggesting he will face charges of inciting an insurrection, election interference, and espionage. However, these are speculations and not confirmed information.

Chandrasoma further argues that Trump has negatively impacted American society, drawing parallels with the dominance displayed by golf player Tiger Woods that led to rule changes. Chandrasoma also criticises Trump’s potential 2024 presidential candidacy, despite his alleged involvement in numerous crimes.

Notably, Chandrasoma points out the preparedness of NATO to continue without American interference, and suggests that Trump would act dictatorially if re-elected in 2024. Furthermore, Chandrasoma criticises Trump’s approach to defence expenditure and reveals that three additional indictments are pending against the former president.

Despite the guilty verdicts, the writer suggests Trump may not face jail time due to his age and the complications of imprisoning a former president. However, Chandrasoma believes this judgment will impact Trump’s political prospects adversely. The writer predicts Trump's defeat in the upcoming election and his eventual jail time, emphasizing potential future social unrest in response to a hypothetical Trump's refusal to concede defeat.
