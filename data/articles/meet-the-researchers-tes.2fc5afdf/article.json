    "One day, in the near or far future, an asteroid about the length of a football stadium will find itself on a collision course with Earth. If we are lucky, it will land in the middle of the vast ocean, creating a good-size but innocuous tsunami, or in an uninhabited patch of desert. But if it has a city in its crosshairs, one of the worst natural disasters in modern times will unfold. As the asteroid steams through the atmosphere, it will begin to fragment\u2014but the bulk of it will likely make it to the ground in just a few seconds, instantly turning anything solid into a fluid and excavating a huge impact crater in a heartbeat. A colossal blast wave, akin to one unleashed by a large nuclear weapon, will explode from the impact site in every direction. Homes dozens of miles away will fold like cardboard. Millions of people could die. Fortunately for all 8 billion of us, planetary defense\u2014the science of preventing asteroid impacts\u2014is a highly active field of research. Astronomers are watching the skies, constantly on the hunt for new near-Earth objects that might pose a threat. And others are actively working on developing ways to prevent a collision should we find an asteroid that seems likely to hit us.  We already know that at least one method works: ramming the rock with an uncrewed spacecraft to push it away from Earth. In September 2022, NASA\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, showed it could be done when a semiautonomous spacecraft the size of a small car, with solar panel wings, was smashed into an (innocuous) asteroid named Dimorphos at 14,000 miles per hour, successfully changing its orbit around a larger asteroid named Didymos.\u00a0 But there are circumstances in which giving an asteroid a physical shove might not be enough to protect the planet. If that\u2019s the case, we could need another method, one that is notoriously difficult to test in real life: a nuclear explosion.",
    "Scientists have used computer simulations to explore this potential method of planetary defense. But in an ideal world, researchers would ground their models with cold, hard, practical data. Therein lies a challenge. Sending a nuclear weapon into space would violate international laws and risk inflaming political tensions. What\u2019s more, it could do damage to Earth: A rocket malfunction could send radioactive debris into the atmosphere.\u00a0 Over the last few years, however, scientists have started to devise some creative ways around this experimental limitation. The effort began in 2023, with a team of scientists led by Nathan Moore, a physicist and chemical engineer at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sandia is a semi-secretive site that serves as the engineering arm of America\u2019s nuclear weapons program. And within that complex lies the Z\u00a0Pulsed Power Facility, or Z\u00a0machine, a cylindrical metallic labyrinth of warning signs and wiring. It\u2019s capable of summoning enough energy to melt diamond.",
    "About 25,000 asteroids more than 460 feet long\u2014a size range that starts with midsize \u201ccity killers\u201d and goes up in impact from there\u2014are thought to exist close to Earth. Just under half of them have been found.  The researchers reckoned they could use the Z machine to re-create the x-ray blast of a nuclear weapon\u2014the radiation that would be used to knock back an asteroid\u2014on a very small and safe scale. It took a while to sort out the details. But by July 2023, Moore and his team were ready. They waited anxiously inside a control room, monitoring the thrumming contraption from afar. Inside the machine\u2019s heart were two small pieces of rock, stand-ins for asteroids, and at the press of a button, a maelstrom of x-rays would thunder toward them. If they were knocked back by those x-rays, it would prove something that, until now, was purely theoretical: You can deflect an asteroid from Earth using a nuke. This experiment \u201chad never been done before,\u201d says Moore. But if it succeeded, its data would contribute to the safety of everyone on the planet. Would it work? Monoliths and rubble piles Asteroid impacts are a natural disaster like any other. You shouldn\u2019t lose sleep over the prospect, but if we get unlucky, an errant space rock may rudely ring Earth\u2019s doorbell. \u201cThe probability of an asteroid striking Earth during my lifetime is very small. But what if one did? What would we do about it?\u201d says Moore. \u201cI think that\u2019s worth being curious about.\u201d  Forget about the gigantic asteroids you know from Hollywood blockbusters. Space rocks over two-thirds of a mile (about one kilometer) in diameter\u2014those capable of imperiling civilization\u2014are certainly out there, and some hew close to Earth\u2019s own orbit. But because these asteroids are so elephantine, astronomers have found almost all of them already, and none pose an impact threat.\u00a0 Related StoryThe Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ready to transform our understanding of the cosmosThe telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made.",
    "Rather, it\u2019s asteroids a size range down\u2014those upwards of 460 feet (140 meters) long\u2014that are of paramount concern. About 25,000 of those are thought to exist close to our planet, and just under half have been found. The day-to-day odds of an impact are extremely low, but even one of the smaller ones in that size range could do significant damage if it found Earth and hit a populated area\u2014a capacity that has led astronomers to dub such midsize asteroids \u201ccity killers.\u201d If we find a city killer that looks likely to hit Earth, we\u2019ll need a way to stop it. That could be technology to break or \u201cdisrupt\u201d the asteroid into fragments that will either miss the planet entirely or harmlessly ignite in the atmosphere. Or it could be something that can deflect the asteroid, pushing it onto a path that will no longer intersect with our blue marble.\u00a0 Because disruption could accidentally turn a big asteroid into multiple smaller, but still deadly, shards bound for Earth, it\u2019s often considered to be a strategy of last resort. Deflection is seen as safer and more elegant. One way to achieve it is to deploy a spacecraft known as a kinetic impactor\u2014a battering ram that collides with an asteroid and transfers its momentum to the rocky interloper, nudging it away from Earth. NASA\u2019s DART mission demonstrated that this can work, but there are some important caveats: You need to deflect the asteroid years in advance to make sure it completely misses Earth, and asteroids that we spot too late\u2014or that are too big\u2014can\u2019t be swatted away by just one DART-like mission. Instead, you\u2019d need several kinetic impactors\u2014maybe many of them\u2014to hit one side of the asteroid perfectly each time in order to push it far enough to save our planet. That\u2019s a tall order for orbital mechanics, and not something space agencies may be willing to gamble on.",
    "In that case, the best option might instead be to detonate a nuclear weapon next to the asteroid. This would irradiate one hemisphere of the asteroid in x-rays, which in a few millionths of a second would violently shatter and vaporize the rocky surface. The stream of debris spewing out of that surface and into space would act like a rocket, pushing the asteroid in the opposite direction. \u201cThere are scenarios where kinetic impact is insufficient, and we\u2019d have to use a nuclear explosive device,\u201d says Moore.  MCKIBILLO   This idea isn\u2019t new. Several decades ago, Peter Schultz, a planetary geologist and impacts expert at Brown University, was giving a planetary defense talk at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, another American lab focused on nuclear deterrence and nuclear physics research. Afterwards, he recalls, none other than Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb and a key member of the Manhattan Project, invited him into his office for a chat. \u201cHe wanted to do one of these near-Earth-\u00adasteroid flybys and wanted to test the nukes,\u201d Schultz says. What, he wondered, would happen if you blasted an asteroid with a nuclear weapon\u2019s x-rays? Could you forestall a spaceborne disaster using weapons of mass destruction? But Teller\u2019s dream wasn\u2019t fulfilled\u2014and it\u2019s unlikely to become a reality anytime soon. The United Nations\u2019 1967 Outer Space Treaty states that no nation can deploy or use nuclear weapons off-world (even if it\u2019s not clear how long certain spacefaring nations will continue to adhere to that rule). Even raising the possibility of using nukes to defend the planet can be tricky. \u201cThere\u2019re still many folks that don\u2019t want to talk about it at all \u2026 even if that were the only option to prevent an impact,\u201d says Megan Bruck Syal, a physicist and planetary defense researcher at Lawrence Livermore. Nuclear weapons have long been a sensitive subject, and with relations between several nuclear nations currently at a new nadir, anxiety over the subject is understandable.\u00a0  But in the US, there are groups of scientists who \u201crecognize that we have a special responsibility as a spacefaring nation and as a nuclear-\u00adcapable nation to look at this,\u201d Syal says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t our preference to use a nuclear explosive, of course. But we are still looking at it, in case it\u2019s needed.\u201d\u00a0 Related StoryEarth is probably safe from a killer asteroid for 1,000 yearsNo asteroid larger than a kilometer is likely to hit us in that time frame, says a new study. But smaller ones could still pose a risk.",
    "But how?\u00a0 Mostly, researchers have turned to the virtual world, using supercomputers at various US laboratories to simulate the asteroid-\u00adagitating physics of a nuclear blast. To put it mildly, \u201cthis is very hard,\u201d says Mary Burkey, a physicist and planetary defense researcher at Lawrence Livermore. You cannot simply flick a switch on a computer and get immediate answers. \u201cWhen a nuke goes off in space, there\u2019s just x-ray light that\u2019s coming out of it. It\u2019s shining on the surface of your asteroid, and you\u2019re tracking those little photons penetrating maybe a tiny little bit into the surface, and then somehow you have to take that micro\u00admeter worth of resolution and then propagate it out onto something that might be on the order of hundreds of meters wide, watching that shock wave propagate and then watching fragments spin off into space. That\u2019s four different problems.\u201d\u00a0  Mimicking the physics of x-ray rock annihilation with as much verisimilitude as possible is difficult work. But recent research using these high-fidelity simulations does suggest that nukes are an effective planetary defense tool for both disruption and deflection. The thing is, though, no two asteroids are alike; each is mechanically and geologically unique, meaning huge uncertainties remain. A more monolithic asteroid might respond in a straightforward way to a nuclear deflection campaign, whereas a rubble pile asteroid\u2014a weakly bound fleet of boulders barely held together by their own gravity\u2014might respond in a chaotic, uncontrollable way. Can you be sure the explosion wouldn\u2019t accidentally shatter the asteroid, turning a cannonball into a hail of bullets still headed for Earth?\u00a0 Simulations can go a long way toward answering these questions, but they remain virtual re-creations of reality, with built-in assumptions. \u201cOur models are only as good as the physics that we understand and that we put into them,\u201d says Angela Stickle, a hypervelocity impact physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. To make sure the simulations are reproducing the correct physics and delivering realistic data, physical experiments are needed to ground them.  Every firing of the Z machine carries the energy of more than 1,000 lightning bolts, and each shot lasts a few millionths of a second.  Researchers studying kinetic impactors can get that sort of real-world data. Along with DART, they can use specialized cannons\u2014like the Vertical Gun Range at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California\u2014to fire all sorts of projectiles at meteorites. In doing so, they can find out how tough or fragile asteroid shards can be, effectively reproducing a kinetic impact mission on a small scale.",
    "Battle-testing nuke-based asteroid defense simulations is another matter. Re-creating the physics of these confrontations on a small scale was long considered to be exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, those keen on fighting asteroids are as persistent as they are creative\u2014and several teams, including Moore\u2019s at Sandia, think they have come up with a solution. X-ray scissors The prime mission of Sandia, like that of Lawrence Livermore, is to help maintain the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal. \u201cIt\u2019s a national security laboratory,\u201d says Moore. \u201cPlanetary defense affects the entire planet,\u201d he adds\u2014making it, by default, a national security issue as well. And that logic, in part, persuaded the powers that be in July 2022 to try a brand-new kind of experiment. Moore took charge of the project in January 2023\u2014and with the shot scheduled for the summer, he had only a few months to come up with the specific plan for the experiment. There was \u201clots of scribbling on my whiteboard, running computer simulations, and getting data to our engineers to design the test fixture for the several months it would take to get all the parts machined and assembled,\u201d he says.",
    "Although there were previous and ongoing experiments that showered asteroid-like targets with x-rays, Moore and his team were frustrated by one aspect of them. Unlike actual asteroids floating freely in space, the micro-\u00adasteroids on Earth were fixed in place. To truly test whether x-rays could deflect asteroids, targets would have to be suspended in a vacuum\u2014and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how that could be achieved. Generating the nuke-like x-rays was the easy part, because Sandia had the Z machine, a hulking mass of diodes, pipes, and wires interwoven with an assortment of walkways that circumnavigate a vacuum chamber at its core. When it\u2019s powered up, electrical currents are channeled into capacitors\u2014and, when commanded, blast that energy at a target or substance to create radiation and intense magnetic pressures.\u00a0  Flanked by klaxons and flashing lights, it\u2019s an intimidating sight. \u201cIt\u2019s the size of a building\u2014about three stories tall,\u201d says Moore. Every firing of the Z machine carries the energy of more than 1,000 lightning bolts, and each shot lasts a few millionths of a second: \u201cYou can\u2019t even blink that fast.\u201d The Z machine is named for the axis along which its energetic particles cascade, but the Z could easily stand for \u201cZeus.\u201d  The Z Pulsed Power Facility, or Z machine, at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, concentrates electricity into short bursts of intense energy that can be used to create x-rays and gamma rays and compress matter to high densities.RANDY MONTOYA/SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORY   The original purpose of the Z\u00a0machine, whose first form was built half a century ago, was nuclear fusion research. But over time, it\u2019s been tinkered with, upgraded, and used for all kinds of science. \u201cThe Z\u00a0machine has been used to compress matter to the same densities [you\u2019d find at] the centers of planets. And we can do experiments like that to better understand how planets form,\u201d Moore says, as an example. And the machine\u2019s preternatural energies could easily be used to generate x-rays\u2014in this case, by electrifying and collapsing a cloud of argon gas. \u201cThe idea of studying asteroid deflection is completely different for us,\u201d says Moore. And the machine \u201cfires just once a day,\u201d he adds, \u201cso all the experiments are planned more than a year in advance.\u201d In other words, the researchers had to be near certain their one experiment would work, or they would be in for a long wait to try again\u2014if they were permitted a second attempt.\u00a0 For some time, they could not figure out how to suspend their micro-asteroids. But eventually, they found a solution: Two incredibly thin bits of aluminum foil would hold their targets in place within the Z machine\u2019s vacuum chamber. When the x-ray blast hit them and the targets, the pieces of foil would be instantly vaporized, briefly leaving the targets suspended in the chamber and allowing them to be pushed back as if they were in space. \u201cIt\u2019s like you wave your magic wand and it\u2019s gone,\u201d Moore says of the foil. He dubbed this technique \u201cx-ray scissors.\u201d",
    "In July 2023, after considerable planning, the team was ready. Within the Z machine\u2019s vacuum chamber were two fingernail-size targets\u2014a bit of quartz and some fused silica, both frequently found on real asteroids. Nearby, a pocket of argon gas swirled away. Satisfied that the gigantic gizmo was ready, everyone left and went to stand in the control room. For a moment, it was deathly quiet.  Stand by. Fire. It was over before their ears could even register a metallic bang. A tempest of electricity shocked the argon gas cloud, causing it to implode; as it did, it transformed into a plasma and x-rays screamed out of it, racing toward the two targets in the chamber. The foil vanished, the surfaces of both targets erupted outward as supersonic sprays of debris, and the targets flew backward, away from the x-rays, at 160 miles per hour.  Moore wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI was in Spain when the experiment was run, because I was celebrating my anniversary with my wife, and there was no way I was going to miss that,\u201d he says. But just after the Z machine was fired, one of his colleagues sent him a very concise text: IT WORKED. \u201cWe knew right away it was a huge success,\u201d says Moore. The implications were immediately clear. The experimental setup was complex, but they were trying to achieve something extremely fundamental: a real-world demonstration that a nuclear blast could make an object in space move.\u00a0  \u201cWe\u2019re genuinely looking at this from the standpoint of \u2018This is a technology that could save lives.\u2019\u201d  Patrick King, a physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, was impressed. Previously, pushing back objects using x-ray vaporization had been extremely difficult to demonstrate in the lab. \u201cThey were able to get a direct measurement of that momentum transfer,\u201d he says, calling the x-ray scissors an \u201celegant\u201d technique.",
    "Sandia\u2019s work took many in the community by surprise. \u201cThe Z\u00a0machine experiment was a bit of a newcomer for the planetary defense field,\u201d says Burkey. But she notes that we can\u2019t overinterpret the results. It isn\u2019t clear, from the deflection of the very small and rudimentary asteroid-like targets, how much a genuine nuclear explosion would deflect an actual asteroid. As ever, more work is needed.\u00a0 King leads a team that is also working on this question. His NASA-funded project involves the Omega Laser Facility, a complex based at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. Omega can generate x-rays by firing powerful lasers at a target within a specialized chamber. Upon being irradiated, the target generates an x-ray flash, similar to the one produced during a nuclear explosion in space, which can then be used to bombard various objects\u2014in this case, some Earth rocks acting as asteroid mimics, and (crucially) some bona fide meteoritic material too.\u00a0 King\u2019s Omega experiments have tried to answer a basic question: \u201cHow much material actually gets removed from the surface?\u201d says King. The amount of material that flies off the pseudo-asteroids, and the vigor with which it\u2019s removed, will differ from target to target. The hope is that these results\u2014which the team is still considering\u2014will hint at how different types of asteroids will react to being nuked. Although experiments with Omega cannot produce the kickback seen in the Z machine, King\u2019s team has used a more realistic and diverse series of targets and blasted them with x-rays hundreds of times. That, in turn, should clue us in to how effectively, or not, actual asteroids would be deflected by a nuclear explosion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say one [experiment] has definitive advantages over the other,\u201d says King. \u201cLike many things in science, each approach can yield insight along different \u2018axes,\u2019 if you will, and no experimental setup gives you the whole picture.\u201d  MCKIBILLO   Experiments like Moore\u2019s and King\u2019s may sound technologically baroque\u2014a bit like lightning-fast Rube Goldberg machines overseen by wizards. But they are likely the first in a long line of increasingly sophisticated tests. \u201cWe\u2019ve just scratched the surface of what we can do,\u201d Moore says. As with King\u2019s experiments, Moore hopes to place a variety of materials in the Z\u00a0machine, including targets that can stand in for the wetter, more fragile carbon-rich asteroids that astronomers commonly see in near-Earth space. \u201cIf we could get our hands on real asteroid material, we\u2019d do it,\u201d he says. And it\u2019s expected that all this experimental data will be fed back into those nuke-versus-\u00adasteroid computer simulations, helping to verify the virtual results. Although these experiments are perfectly safe, planetary defenders remain fully cognizant of the taboo around merely discussing the use of nukes for any reason\u2014even if that reason is potentially saving the world. \u201cWe\u2019re genuinely looking at this from the standpoint of \u2018This is a technology that could save lives,\u2019\u201d King says. Inevitably, Earth will be imperiled by a dangerous asteroid. And the hope is that when that day arrives, it can be dealt with using something other than a nuke. But comfort should be taken from the fact that scientists are researching this scenario, just in case it\u2019s our only protection against the firmament. \u201cWe are your taxpayer dollars at work,\u201d says Burkey.\u00a0 There\u2019s still some way to go before they can be near certain that this asteroid-stopping technique will succeed. Their progress, though, belongs to everyone. \u201cUltimately,\u201d says Moore, \u201cwe all win if we solve this problem.\u201d\u00a0 Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist based in London and the author, most recently, of How to Kill an Asteroid: The Real Science of Planetary Defense. hide"
