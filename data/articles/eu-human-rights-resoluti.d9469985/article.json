    "What\u2019s happened?On March 13th the European parliament voted to adopt a human-rights resolution on Thailand, condemning the kingdom for the deportation of Uyghur refugees to China in\u00a0February. The resolution also urges the European Commission to leverage free-trade agreement (FTA) negotiations in order to press the country to reform its lese-majesty\u00a0law.Why does it matter?The development is in line with EIU\u2019s view that\u00a0Thailand will continue to walk a\u00a0diplomatic tightrope\u00a0between maintaining amicable relations with both the West and China.\u00a0The neutral stance in Thai foreign policy is made evident by the country\u2019s formal application to join\u00a0the OECD, a grouping primarily consisting of advanced, Western economies, as well as the decision to become a partner of the\u00a0BRICS, a group of emerging market countries, in\u00a02024.We believe that the European parliament\u2019s latest resolution will not alter Thailand\u2019s conduct of diplomacy, in which at times the country will have to \u201cchoose a side\u201d, as the deportation decision illustrates. We believe that the Thai government will make practical decisions that suit national best interests. Given Thailand\u2019s close economic ties with China,\u00a0the European parliament\u2019s call for Thailand to suspend extradition treaties with China is unlikely to be\u00a0met.\u00a0Members of the European parliament state that they want Thailand \u201cto strengthen its institutions in line with human-rights standards and to grant amnesty to all parliamentarians and activists persecuted or imprisoned under repressive laws, including through convictions for lese-majesty\u201d.\u00a0We believe that Thailand will take limited reform actions on human rights, but we do not foresee a major amendment of the lese-majesty law, given the enduring influence of the military-aligned establishment over Thai politics.\u00a0Pro-establishment coalition partner parties such as the United\u00a0Thai Nation and the Bhumjai\u00a0Thai Party have stated clearly that they will not support such a reform. Thailand\u2019s proposal for constitutional reform, which is expected later this year, will be closely watched for clues on its reach. We believe that the government could release some imprisoned offenders of the lese-majesty law to appease the\u00a0EU, but a law amendment will be unlikely.What next?The resolution could complicate the\u00a0ongoing FTA negotiations\u00a0between the EU and Thailand, which are at an advanced stage currently. Talks so far have sought to find common ground on greater labour market and environmental standards that would apply to the conduct of businesses in Thailand, while Thailand\u2019s main objectives are improved market access for various products including agricultural and electronics, improved trade facilitation measures, as well as lower tariffs for its exports. Thailand has expressed hopes to conclude the talks by 2025.\u00a0The European parliament\u2019s resolution could delay the FTA conclusion, although we do not foresee it derailing talks or leading to\u00a0strong punitive\u00a0actions.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
