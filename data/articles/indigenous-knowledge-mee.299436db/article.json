    "There is no word for art in most Native American languages. Instead, the closest terms speak not to objecthood but to action and intention. In Lakota, \u201cw\u00f3wa\u010dhi\u014bt\u021fa\u014bka\u201d implies deep thought or reflection, while \u201cw\u00f3\u010dhekiye\u201d suggests offering or prayer. Art is not separate from life; it is ceremony, instruction, design. Like architecture or code, it carries knowledge and enacts responsibility. Its power lies not in being preserved or displayed but in how it moves, teaches, and connects through use\u2014principles that challenge the tech industry\u2019s assumptions about intelligence and interaction. A new vanguard of Native artists\u2014Suzanne Kite (Oglala Lakota), Raven Chacon (Din\u00e9), and Nicholas Galanin (Tling\u00edt)\u2014are building on this principle. They are united not by stereotypical weaving and carving or revanchist critique of Silicon Valley, but through their rejection of extractive data models in favor of relationship-based systems. These technologists put the human-tech relationship at the center of their work. Suzanne Kite\u2019s AI art installations, for example, model a Lakota framework of data sovereignty: intelligence that emerges only through reciprocal, consensual interaction. Unlike systems that assume user consent via opaque terms of service, her kinetic machines require the viewer\u2019s physical presence\u2014and give something back in return.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s my data. It\u2019s my training set. I know exactly what I did to train it. It\u2019s not a large model but a small and intimate one,\u201d Kite says. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly interested in making the most technologically advanced anything. I\u2019m an artist; I don\u2019t make tech demos. So the complexity needs to come at many layers\u2014not just the technical.\u201d",
    "Where Kite builds working prototypes of consent-based AI, other artists in this cohort explore how sound, robotics, and performance can confront the logic of automation, surveillance, and extraction. But Native people have never been separate from technology. The land, labor, and lifeways that built America\u2019s infrastructure\u2014including its tech\u2014are Indigenous. The question isn\u2019t whether Native cultures are contributing now, but why they were ever considered separate.\u00a0 Native technologies reject the false binaries foundational to much Western innovation. These artists ask a more radical question: What if intelligence couldn\u2019t be gathered until a relationship had been established? What if the default were refusal, not extraction? These artists aren\u2019t asking to be included in today\u2019s systems. They\u2019re building what should come next.  Suzanne Kite  Wi\u010dh\u00ed\u014b\u010dala \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b (Seven Little Girls)2023For Kite, the fundamental flaw of Western technology is its severance of knowledge from the body. In this installation, a four-meter hair braid with embedded sensors translates the artist\u2019s body movements into machine-learning algorithms. During her live performance, Kite dances while the braid reads the force and rhythm of her gestures, generating audio responses that fill the museum gallery of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Below her, stones arranged in patterns reflecting Lakota star maps anchor the performance in traditional astronomical knowledge.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   \u00cdnyan Iy\u00e9 (Telling Rock)2019This installation uses embedded AI to speak and respond to viewers, upending assumptions about intelligence and agency. \u201cPeople listen close, I whisper / The rock speaks beyond hearing \u2026 Many nations speaking / We speak to each other without words,\u201d it intones, its lights shifting as viewers engage with its braided tendrils. The piece aims to convey what Kite calls \u201cmore-than-human intelligence\u201d\u2014systems rooted in reciprocity, the fundamental principle that all relationships involve mutual exchange and responsibility.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Raven Chacon  Voiceless Mass2021Raven Chacon\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning musical composition Voiceless Mass premiered in 2021 at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Milwaukee. The piece generates what he calls \u201csounds the building can hear\u201d\u2014electronic frequencies that exploit the cathedral\u2019s acoustics to create spectral voices without human vocal cords, a technological s\u00e9ance that gives presence to historical absence. Each site-specific performance is recorded, generating material that mirrors how sensor networks log presence\u2014but only with explicit consent.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Nicholas Galanin  A\u00e1ni y\u00e9i xat duwas\u00e1akw (I am called Land)2025Galanin\u2019s mechanical drum installation stages a conflict between machine motion and human memory, asking what happens when culture is performed without a consenting body. A box drum\u2014an instrument historically carved from red cedar and hung with braided spruce root\u2014is here made of cherrywood and suspended from the ceiling at the MassArt Art Museum in Boston as is traditionally done in Tlingit plank houses. Played at tribal meetings, celebrations, and ceremonies, these drums hold sonic memory as well as social function. A mechanical arm strikes, unfaltering, at the tempo of a heartbeat; like a warning, the sound pulses with the tension between automation and ancestry.\u0096\u0096\u0096COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   I think it goes like this (pick yourself up) 2025This Herculean bronze sculpture cast from deconstructed faux totem blocks serves to indict settler sabotage of Native technology and culture. Unlike today\u2019s digital records\u2014from genealogical databases to virtual versions of sacred texts like the Bible\u2014Tlingit data is carved in wood. Galanin\u2019s totem poles underscore their function as information systems, their carvings encoding history, mythology, and family.COURTESY OF THE ARTIST   Petala Ironcloud is a California-born Lakota/Dakota and Jewish writer and textile artist based in New York. hide"
