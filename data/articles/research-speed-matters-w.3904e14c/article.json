    "Companies and their leaders face new pressures to make public statements about controversial and sometimes divisive social and political issues. New research shows that timing matters: consumers perceive a relationship between speed and authenticity, and...more",
    "In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing by Minneapolis police officers in 2020, individuals began protesting racial injustice both in person and online. But it wasn\u2019t just individuals \u2014\u00a0many well-known companies in corporate America seemed to publicly align themselves with protestors, rather than staying silent or neutral.",
    "In the years since, public corporate activism has become increasingly common \u2014 as has the backlash against some of these stances. We wanted to understand how consumers view firms\u2019 public responses, particularly on social media. How does corporate activism influence consumption, if at all? What do consumers notice? Do they prefer firms that respond quickly, those that respond more measuredly, or those that don\u2019t respond at all?",
    "To explore these questions, we analyzed the Instagram posts put forth by Fortune 500 companies in the month following George Floyd\u2019s murder, as well as the more than 26,000 comments made in response to those posts. We found that how quickly firms responded mattered tremendously.",
    "Are Consumers Sensitive to Response Time?",
    "Even while controlling for aspects of each post, such as the number of words and ratings of the post\u2019s authenticity, and aspects of the firm, such as the number of followers they had and the firm\u2019s industry, how quickly the firm responded strongly predicted the sentiment of the comments made by consumers in response. As time elapsed after George Floyd\u2019s death, user comments in response to the firm were significantly more likely to become negative, unsupportive, and disagreeable.",
    "Next we conducted a series of experiments about consumers\u2019 likelihood to purchase from firms. Slower firm responses to Floyd\u2019s death meant that people became less likely to purchase from the firm. This outcome was driven by people\u2019s tendency to infer that faster responses reflect more authentic dedication to the firm\u2019s public statements.",
    "Furthermore, there was no benefit for responding after one month versus not responding at all, which suggests diminishing returns for late responders: A late response may be indistinguishable from never responding at all.",
    "Still, these results were based on participants who largely supported the sociopolitical stance expressed by firms. We tested the effects of firm response time on a range of issues from less controversial (such as calling for the immediate end to Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine) to extremely divisive (such as requiring vaccine mandates as a condition of employment), where the level of divisiveness was determined by the extent of disagreement among Democrat and Republican participants on each issue. [Note: Our research was conducted before the current conflict in the Middle East.]",
    "Considering issue divisiveness shed light on some nuance in our findings: Fast response times were beneficial for less-controversial issues, signaling greater stance authenticity, but the benefit of outspoken corporate activism diminished for highly divisive issues.",
    "Why does response time matter? In general, people use response time as a rule of thumb to infer others\u2019 motives. Prior research suggests that it may be sensible for firms to respond slowly to a sociopolitical event because consumers will view the time lapse as a signal of deliberation, care, diligence, or effort. Our findings suggest that in the context of brand activism, response time operates differently. Here, more deliberation signals a lack of conviction about the issue at hand, and faster responses are viewed more favorably.",
    "Consumers use fast response time as an informative cue of an organization\u2019s authentic commitment to the issue at large. As in face-to-face conversations, where fast response times are seen as an honest signal of engagement and connection, speedy posts on social media may operate the same way \u2014 most people implicitly believe that people or firms that feel strongly don\u2019t need time to deliberate, or to hem and haw among stakeholders.",
    "Still, responding swiftly may not always make sense. First, it may be quite difficult to coordinate stakeholders to make quick decisions about unfolding sociopolitical events. And past research suggests that the alignment between firm and consumer views matter. While many consumers report admiring brand activism, this is mostly the case when the stances of the consumer and the firm are aligned. Consumers are less likely to stay committed to brands they routinely disagree with.",
    "Is taking a fast stance on a divisive issue bad? Not entirely. We found that while purchasing intentions go down, even consumers who disagree with a firm\u2019s stance are likely to continue to admire the firm\u2019s authenticity.",
    "Lessons for Organizations",
    "Our findings suggest sociopolitical statements by organizations are not judged by consumers in the same light. When engaging in corporate activism, we suggest that organizations consider several key questions:",
    "Is the sociopolitical event highly divisive? While taking a timely stance boosts perceptions of stance authenticity, for highly divisive issues, doing so will not benefit purchasing intentions. Further, an issue\u2019s divisiveness might not be clear or easy to measure, and divisiveness can evolve over time. If the sociopolitical event holds significance for your firm, it\u2019s essential to monitor how the tension around the issue may wax or wane.",
    "Does it make sense that my organization takes a stance supporting one side of the sociopolitical event? Consider your reputation as an organization as well as past actions, but also consider who your main customer base is and how they may react.",
    "Are my direct competitors likely to make a statement supporting one side of the sociopolitical event? If so, do I have the resources to respond faster? If you are planning on making a sociopolitical statement, make sure the timing in which it occurs is either before or around the same time as your competitors. When it comes to brand activism, thought leadership is more powerful than followership.",
    "Can you respond now and formulate an action plan later? Firms may be able to claim the best of both worlds by posting a quick response to a sociopolitical event, with the promise of a well-measured action plan to come later.",
    "Organizations face growing pressure from consumers and stakeholders to take public stances on sociopolitical issues, yet many struggle with how to do so without appearing inauthentic. Unlike other types of public firm decisions, such as product launches, where careful deliberation can be wise, appreciated, or increase enthusiasm and demand, our research shows that consumers treat firm response time to sociopolitical events differently \u2014 as an informative cue of the firm\u2019s commitment to an issue. When engaging in activism, our findings suggest that organizations should consider the timing of their statements as well as the divisiveness of the issue in order to clearly articulate a message that aligns with their values.",
