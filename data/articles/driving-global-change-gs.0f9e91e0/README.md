GSCS International – Sri Lanka successfully organised the SustainSphere 2.0 program, aimed at innovating tomorrow’s industry through sustainability.

Held in Sri Lanka, the event attracted a diverse audience, including representatives from academic institutions, government bodies, trade associations, brands, and various client organisations, all gathered to explore the future of sustainable development in the apparel industry.

The first keynote address was delivered by University of Moratuwa Department of Facilities Management Senior Lecturer Dr. Harshini Mallawarachchi. Dr. Mallawarachchi emphasised Circular Economy: A Pathway for Net-Zero Apparel Manufacturing.

The second keynote address was delivered by Employers’ Federation of Ceylon Deputy Director General Adhil Khasim. His speech focused on Innovative Approaches, Future Trends, and Recent Amendments in Social and Labor Compliance: A Sri Lankan Perspective.

Following the keynote speeches, a panel discussion was chaired by GSCS International Ltd. Managing Director Abdul Mottaleb, which explored how innovation can drive sustainability and why it is crucial for industries to adopt sustainable strategies in an increasingly eco-conscious world. The panel included key figures such as Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka Environmental Impact Assessment Deputy Director General N.S. Gamage, Hirdaramani Group General Manager of Sustainability Leonie Vaas, Dr. Harshini Mallawarachchi from the University of Moratuwa, and Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence, each contributing their expertise to highlight the importance of sustainability across various sectors.

According to GSCS, SustainSphere 2.0 marks a significant shift towards making sustainability a fundamental requirement across all industries. The program is seen as a stepping stone for future initiatives, aimed at driving transformative change globally, in alignment with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

GSCS has been at the forefront of providing professional certification services in areas such as labour and human rights auditing, product certifications, environmental assessments, and circular economy practices. By maintaining strict adherence to both national and international standards, GSCS helps organisations across industries navigate the complexities of sustainable development, ensuring they remain competitive and compliant in the global market.

During the event, Yohan Lawrence, representing the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), highlighted the apparel industry’s proactive steps toward embracing sustainability. He noted that the global market’s increasing demand for eco-friendly and ethically sourced products has made sustainable practices essential for maintaining competitiveness. Lawrence emphasised that Sri Lanka’s apparel sector, long recognised for its high standards, is committed to enhancing transparency within supply chains and adopting innovative solutions to meet sustainability goals. He also pointed out that collaboration between industry stakeholders, academia, and governing bodies is vital for ensuring long-term success in these efforts.

As GSCS continues its efforts through programs like SustainSphere 2.0, it is clear that innovating industries through sustainability will remain a top priority in the future.
