    "What\u2019s happened?On January 20th a Chinese company, DeepSeek, released the technical details of its latest reasoning model, which is on par with Western models but at a fraction of the cost. The company has said that it spent less than US$6m training the model, compared with billions for Western companies, using older Nvidia chips that were still allowed in China under US export\u00a0rules.Why does it matter?There are two major questions to consider: How good is the model? And How much did it cost? On the first question, DeepSeek is on par with many of its Western counterparts,\u00a0but it has not surpassed them. Instead it has built on the capabilities of these much more expensive models, claiming to have replicated them at a much lower cost. How much lower is unclear, but DeepSeek claims that its costs are up to 97% lower than those of its Western rivals, largely because it used older Nvidia chips. The model is open source, which means that companies can replicate its parameters, and its low cost will put pressure on more expensive proprietary models by offering a much lower price point for\u00a0end-users.If this is true, the economics of AI will change. Big tech and other companies have spent and are spending billions in capital expenditure and infrastructure\u2014expenditure that will be called into question if a much cheaper model reaches the same technical capabilities. The success of DeepSeek also calls into question the recent announcement by the Trump administration of Stargate, an ambitious AI infrastructure venture. OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank have pledged to spend US$100bn on Stargate in 2025 and up to US$500bn over the next four years, and Microsoft says that it will spend US$80bn this year, and Meta US$65bn. Such announcements show that big tech is still willing to spend, but it will be under pressure to show monetisation and profitability sooner rather than\u00a0later.DeepSeek, however, demonstrates China\u2019s continued dependence on Western technology. Even if the model is as cheap as DeepSeek says it is, it has been achieved through the use of Nvidia, not Chinese chips. This is similar to the Huawei Mate smartphone, where the Chinese company managed to manufacture a relatively advanced chip (7\u00a0nm, where the cutting edge is at 2-3\u00a0nm) despite US restrictions. But it could only do so through the use of ASML (Netherlands) machinery, which no Chinese company has so far been able to\u00a0replicate.What next?We do not expect the US to remove its\u00a0tech restrictions\u00a0on Chinese companies. Chinese ambitions to lead multiple technologies (including AI and chips), as highlighted in the government\u2019s Made in 2025 plan launched in 2015, puts the country in direct competition with the\u00a0US.However, the competitive landscape might change.\u00a0It is unclear whether Western companies will use Chinese technologies, even at a lower cost, because of the geopolitical implications.\u00a0DeepSeek will fall in a similar category as Huawei or TikTok in the West, with national security and privacy concerns likely to lead to restrictions.\u00a0There are also concerns over political perspective: the model does not answer queries on Tiananmen Square for instance. Competition may also change if big tech reviews its capex plans. AI will remain an important area, but perhaps the focus will move from large language models towards a different type of\u00a0architecture.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
