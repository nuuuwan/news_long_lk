👩‍⚖️ The Supreme Court made two interim rulings - first, restraining Deshabandu from his role as IGP, and second, about potentially appointing a replacement.
  
🗂️ Regarding the potential appointment, the ruling simply directs the President to consider a suitable candidate if he wishes.

💼 This essentially allows the President to make an acting appointment according to his own judgment and the law.

😑 However, it's clear that the President doesn't wish to follow this direction, based on a statement made by the PM in Parliament.

⚖️ Despite this, the government cannot allow Deshabandu to remain in his position, as this would violate the court order and risk contempt of court charges.

🏛️ Government officials' statements on the matter in Parliament could be protected due to parliamentary privileges.

🔒 So far, all discussions on this matters have been had within Parliament walls, presumably protected by these privileges.

⛔ However, Deshabandu himself has no such protections. If he is found to have been performing the duties of IGP, statements made in Parliament, while protected, can still be used to substantiate these claims.

🤔 Perhaps, it's speculated, the concerned officer is power-hungry and not fully aware of the potential legal consequences of his actions.

💥 Violation of a judicial order will undoubtedly yield punishment eventually.
