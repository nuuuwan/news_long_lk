The Colombo High Court sentenced Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera to four years in prison and a Rs. 100,000 fine for denigrating Islam and the Muslim community at a 2016 press conference, rejecting the claim that he should be released on bail due to illness. However, the Chief Prelates of Sri Lanka's three primary Buddhist chapters are calling for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to pardon and release Gnanasara Thera for the Vesak festival despite his name not appearing on the list of prisoners to be set free for the occasion. Prior to this, Gnanasara Thera was serving a six-year sentence for contempt of court, from which he was pardoned by then President Maithripala Sirisena.
