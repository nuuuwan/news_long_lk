A few weeks ago, a fire broke out at the Moss Landing Power Plant in California, the world\u2019s largest collection of batteries on the grid. Although the flames were extinguished in a few days, the metaphorical smoke is still clearing.

    "Some residents in the area have reported health issues that they claim are related to the fire, and some environmental tests revealed pollutants in the water and ground near where the fire burned. One group has filed a lawsuit against the company that owns the site. In the wake of high-profile fires like Moss Landing, there are very understandable concerns about battery safety. At the same time, as more wind, solar power, and other variable electricity sources come online, large energy storage installations will be even more crucial for the grid.",
    "Let\u2019s catch up on what happened in this fire, what the lingering concerns are, and what comes next for the energy storage industry. The Moss Landing fire was spotted in the afternoon on January 16, according to local news reports. It started small but quickly spread to a huge chunk of batteries at the plant. Over 1,000 residents were evacuated, nearby roads were closed, and a wider emergency alert warned those nearby to stay indoors.",
    "The fire hit the oldest group of batteries installed at Moss Landing, a 300-megawatt array that came online in 2020. Additional installations bring the total capacity at the site to about 750 megawatts, meaning it can deliver as much energy to the grid as a standard coal-fired power plant for a few hours at a time. According to a statement that site owner Vistra Energy gave to the New York Times, most of the batteries inside the affected building (the one that houses the 300MW array) burned. However, the company doesn\u2019t have an exact tally, because crews are still prohibited from going inside to do a visual inspection. This isn\u2019t the first time that batteries at Moss Landing have caught fire\u2014there have been several incidents at the plant since it opened. However, this event was \u201cmuch more significant\u201d than previous fires, says Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental studies at San Jose State University, who\u2019s studied the plant. Residents are worried about the potential consequences.The US Environmental Protection Agency monitored the nearby air for hydrogen fluoride, a dangerous gas that can be produced in lithium-ion battery fires, and didn\u2019t detect levels higher than California\u2019s standards. But some early tests detected elevated levels of metals including cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese in soil around the plant. Tests also detected metals in local drinking water, though at levels considered to be safe.

    "Citing some of those tests, a group of residents filed a lawsuit against Vistra last week, alleging that the company (along with a few other named defendants) failed to implement adequate safety measures despite previous incidents at the facility. The suit\u2019s legal team includes Erin Brockovich, the activist famous for her work on a 1990s case against Pacific Gas & Electric Company involving contaminated groundwater from oil and gas equipment in California. The lawsuit, and Brockovich\u2019s involvement in particular, raises a point that I think is worth recognizing here: Technologies that help us address climate change still have the potential to cause harm, and taking that seriously is crucial.\u00a0 The oil and gas industry has a long history of damaging local environments and putting people in harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s evident in local accidents and long-term pollution, and in the sense that burning fossil fuels drives climate change, which has widespread effects around the world.\u00a0 Low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries don\u2019t add to the global problem of climate change. But many of these projects are industrial sites, and their effects can still be felt by local communities, especially when things go wrong as they did in the Moss Landing fire.",
    "The question now is whether those concerns and lawsuits will affect the industry more broadly. In a news conference, one local official called the fire \u201ca Three Mile Island event for this industry,\u201d referring to the infamous 1979 accident at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant. That was a turning point for nuclear power, after which public support declined sharply.\u00a0 With the growing number of electric vehicles and batteries for energy storage on the grid, more high-profile fires have hit the news, like last year\u2019s truck fire in LA, the spate of e-bike battery fires in New York City, or one at a French recycling plant last year.\u00a0 \u201cBattery energy storage systems are complex machines,\u201d Mulvaney says. \u201cComplex systems have a lot of potential failures.\u201d\u00a0 When it comes to large grid-scale installations, battery safety has already improved since Moss Landing was built in 2020, as Canary Media\u2019s Julian Spector points out in a recent story. One reason is that many newer sites use a different chemistry that\u2019s considered safer. Newer energy storage facilities also tend to isolate batteries better, so small fires won\u2019t spread as dramatically as they did in this case.\u00a0  There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about this fire, particularly when it comes to how it started.\u00a0 Learning from the results of the ongoing investigations will be important, because we can only expect to see more batteries coming online in the years ahead.\u00a0 In 2023, there were roughly 54 gigawatts\u2019 worth of utility-scale batteries on the grid globally. If countries follow through on stated plans for renewables, that number could increase tenfold by the end of the decade.\u00a0 Energy storage is a key tool in transforming our grid and meeting our climate goals, and the industry is moving quickly. Safety measures need to keep up.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading E-bike battery fires, including ones started by delivery drivers\u2019 vehicles, have plagued New York City.
