Extensive research has indicated the benefits of showing gratitude to those around you, including your colleagues or employees. However, a new study suggests that the timing of these expressions can make a big difference. Through two experiments and an analysis...more

Imagine this scenario: in response to financial pressures, your company has been going through a series of downsizing rounds. With each round, a larger number of employees on your team are impacted. Team morale is at an all-time low and you can tell everyone is on edge. In this latest round, you are tasked with laying off half your team, including one employee who recently bought their first home and another employee who is currently on maternity leave. You are tossing and turning the night before and cannot sleep due to the flood of negative emotions you have about these upcoming conversations. You receive a message from your boss asking if you’re ready for the conversations the next day. You tell your boss that it has been really difficult having these conversations every few weeks and you’re really not looking forward to doing it yet again, especially considering the circumstances of the employees on your team. What should your boss say to you in this moment?

According to our recently published research, the most skillful thing your boss could do is to express genuine gratitude to you in advance of this unpleasant task. In a series of studies, we analyzed four years’ worth of emails and conducted interviews with employees in the intensive care units (ICUs) of a top-ranked U.S. medical center. We then ran two experiments with more than 600 online gig workers across multiple industries. Our finding: when you express gratitude to others before they engage in a distressing task it helps counteract some of the negative emotions associated with the task. Expressing gratitude early also makes employees more likely to persist through difficulty and bounce back and be resilient following failure.

Our findings offer insight into ways to provide meaningful gratitude and create a culture where your employees feel their work is seen, supported, and valued.

The Need for Gratitude

Even under the best of circumstances, people yearn to receive gratitude from their bosses. In a survey of 2,000 employees, 70% reported that they would feel better about themselves if their boss were more grateful, and 81% said that they would work harder for a grateful boss. This research also shows a “gratitude gap”: While employees wish for more gratitude at work (a place where most of us spend nearly a third of our lives), they are more likely to receive gratitude almost anywhere else. Genuine gratitude at work is surprisingly rare, especially from those in power, and when times are tough.

Despite this, the importance of expressing and receiving gratitude in the workplace is evident, and some companies have endeavored to cultivate a culture of gratitude. This has included efforts like launching Slack channels dedicated to #gratitude or #kudos, and other workplace mechanisms to encourage inter-employee gratitude for helpful actions that they’ve taken to further the goals of the business.

According to our research, however, thanking people after they engage in their tasks does not provoke the same resilience and perseverance as expressing gratitude before the task begins.

In our initial study, we set out to explore the emotions that employees experience in high-stress work environments. After examining four years of employee emails and then interviewing employees at a top hospital’s ICUs, we found that many employees expressed gratitude before a colleague took on a challenging task or shift, and that when they did so it helped the colleague feel more socially connected and purposeful — and be more resilient and persistent if problems arose.

To further explore the effects of gratitude and its timing, we conducted two follow-up experiments with U.S. online gig workers. In the first, 331 participants were thanked either before or after working on an unsolvable word-association puzzle. Those who were thanked before the task reported greater feelings of social worth and willingness to continue with additional tasks even after failure compared to the group that was thanked after the experiment.

In the second study we gave 330 new subjects solvable but difficult geometric puzzles and tested the effects of other positive sentiments, like hope. Expressing gratitude in advance, we found, was significantly associated with social worth, while hope in advance of the difficult task was unrelated to social worth. Offering gratitude in advance, unlike other mechanisms we tested, helped counteract the negative emotions caused by challenging tasks by increasing participants’ feelings of social worth. Increasing people’s sense of social impact, for example, did not have this emotionally regulating effect.

How to Show Thankfulness Meaningfully

Imagine again our earlier scenario when we asked you to imagine you were tasked with alerting colleagues about layoffs. The most tactful thing your boss could do is to express their genuine gratitude before you begin. Something as simple as, “Thank you for taking on this difficult task. I understand how unpleasant this is and appreciate you taking this responsibility so seriously.” Our research found this “thanks in advance” expression of gratitude works by helping to down regulate the negative emotions associated with the difficult task before it actually occurs and encourages you to stick with it, despite it being extremely difficult and unpleasant.

Instead of being a meaningless phrase used to sign off on an email or a sentiment that is only expressed after the fact, our research suggests that intentionally expressing gratitude in advance of a distressing or difficult task may favorably influence employee behavior. To do so effectively, our research suggests these four steps can make a difference:

1. Anticipate distress, difficulty, and unpleasant emotions.

The first step, and most important, is the anticipation of an employee’s experience of distress, difficulty, or unpleasant emotions (e.g., anxiety, frustration). This requires not only being aware of what is going on in the moment, but also what is likely to happen in the future. Try to take on the perspective of your employee: what about what they’re being asked to do might be painful or difficult? This awareness and anticipation can come from a number of places, including your own prior experience and knowledge that the task ahead will be unpleasant, the other person’s prior experience the last time they had to engage in the task (in our example, having layoff conversations), or something that the other person shares with you directly (e.g., “I’m really dreading these layoff conversations on Friday”). Rather than hoping it won’t be that big of a deal, invalidating, or trivializing the situation, you can use this information to take prescient, preemptive action.

2. Show genuine gratitude.

Before the employee goes into a difficult and distressing situation, express genuine gratitude to them. In order for this expression of gratitude to be effective, it needs to include a number of features, including being specifically tailored to the person and non-generic, of appropriate intensity, and not too over the top given the current situation and nature of the relationship — inauthentic gratitude will not yield desired results. It’s also important to use words that explicitly describe why the employee’s behavior matters and is impactful. In expressing genuine gratitude, you should remind the employee that their behavior — even though the situation is difficult and distressing — has a positive impact in furthering the group or organization’s goals, and that their contributions are truly valued by the team and organization. Our research finds that expressing gratitude (anticipatory or otherwise) has a positive effect on employees’ sense of collective social worth, and detailing how it benefits the team can help reiterate it.

3. Check in after the situation.

Check in with the employee after the situation has concluded. While anticipatory expressions of gratitude serve an important emotion regulatory function that buffers the negative experience, “thanks in advance,” no matter how heartfelt, does not completely eliminate the negative emotional experience. Prompt the employee with open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about how it went,” “How are you feeling now?” or “How can I best support you?” Additionally, these conversations can help you to better understand your employee, what the pain points of their position are, and can help improve your ability to provide proactive gratefulness in the future, as you’ll better understand what about a task makes it most challenging. If necessary, repeat your genuine expression of gratitude to the employee after the event. A little gratitude repetition never hurts, especially for employees who seldom hear it at work.

4. Cultivate a culture of gratitude.

Our findings suggest that gratitude in advance is successful in part because it makes people feel a strong sense of collective social worth. They believe they are a valued part of the team and that their contributions to this team are meaningful, even when the tasks are difficult. While it’s important for managers to give gratitude in advance, supervisors should also encourage their team to liberally extend gratitude amongst themselves; for example, expressing genuine gratitude to other team members when they embark on a project or new initiative together, or when one team member does something helpful for another team member. And don’t forget to express gratitude upwards to supervisors (a new spin on what some refer to as “managing up” or “caring for the caregivers”). This is likely to create an even stronger sense of connectedness throughout the organization, which could further boost employees’ resilience should they meet obstacles along the way.

According to Gallup’s Global Emotions report, negative emotions are higher today than they were a decade ago. There’s a lot about work that can be difficult and distressing, and this can contribute to the general dread that many employees feel about their work, not just on Sunday night. While many of these challenges cannot be immediately solved, they can be assessed and acknowledged in advance. One of the most meaningful ways to acknowledge others’ efforts is to not wait until after the fact, but to anticipate it. A little “thanks in advance” can go a long way.
