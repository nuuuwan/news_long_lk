    "The UK\u2019s new moonshot research agency just launched an \u00a381 million ($106 million) program to develop early warning systems to sound the alarm if Earth gets perilously close to crossing climate tipping points. A climate tipping point is a threshold beyond which certain ecosystems or planetary processes begin to shift from one stable state to another, triggering dramatic and often self-reinforcing changes in the climate system.\u00a0  The Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) will announce today that it\u2019s seeking proposals to work on systems for two related climate tipping points. One is the accelerating melting\u00a0of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which could raise sea levels dramatically. The other is the weakening of the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, a huge current rotating counterclockwise south of Greenland that may have played a role in triggering the Little Ice Age around the 14th century.\u00a0 The goal of the five-year program will be to reduce scientific uncertainty about when these events could occur, how they would affect the planet and the species on it, and over what period those effects might develop and persist. In the end, ARIA hopes to deliver a proof of concept demonstrating that\u00a0early warning systems can be \u201caffordable, sustainable, and justified.\u201d No such dedicated system exists today, though there\u2019s considerable research being done to better understand the likelihood and consequences of surpassing these and other climate tipping points.",
    "Sarah Bohndiek, a program director for the tipping points research program, says we underappreciate the possibility that crossing these points could significantly accelerate the effects of climate change and increase the dangers, possibly within the next few decades.By developing an early warning system, \u201cwe might be able to change the way that we think about climate change and think about our preparedness for it,\u201d says Bohndiek, a professor of biomedical physics at the University of Cambridge.\u00a0 ARIA intends to support teams that will work toward three goals: developing low-cost sensors that can withstand harsh environments and provide more precise and needed data about the conditions of these systems; deploying those and other sensing technologies to create \u201can observational network to monitor these tipping systems\u201d; and building computer models that harness the laws of physics and artificial intelligence to pick up \u201csubtle early warning signs of tipping\u201d in the data.",
    "But observers stress that designing precise early warning systems for either system would be no simple feat and might not be possible anytime soon. Not only do scientists have limited understanding of these systems, but the data\u00a0 on how they\u2019ve behaved in the past is patchy and noisy, and setting up extensive monitoring tools in these environments is expensive and cumbersome.\u00a0 Still, there\u2019s wide agreement that we need to better understand these systems and the risks that the world may face. Unlocking breakthroughs It is clear that the tipping of either of these systems could have huge effects on Earth and its inhabitants. As the world warmed in recent decades, trillions of tons of ice melted off the Greenland Ice Sheet, pouring fresh water into the North Atlantic, pushing up ocean levels, and reducing the amount of heat that the snow and ice reflected back into space.\u00a0  Melting rates are increasing as Arctic warming speeds ahead of the global average and hotter ocean waters chip away at ice shelves that buttress land-based glaciers. Scientists fear that as those shelves collapse, the ice sheet will become increasingly unstable.\u00a0 The complete loss of the ice sheet would raise global sea levels by more than 20 feet (six meters), submerging coastlines and kick-starting mass climate migration around the globe. But at any point along the way, the influx of water into the North Atlantic could also substantially slow down the convection systems that help to drive the Subpolar Gyre, because fresher water isn\u2019t as dense and prone to sinking. (Saltier, cooler water readily sinks.) The weakening of the Subpolar Gyre could cool parts of northwest Europe and eastern Canada, shift the jet stream northward, create more erratic weather patterns across Europe, and undermine the productivity of agriculture and fisheries, according to one study last year.",

    "The Subpolar Gyre may also influence the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a network of ocean currents that moves massive amounts of heat, salt, and carbon dioxide around the globe. The specifics of how a weakened Subpolar Gyre would affect the AMOC are still the subject of ongoing research, but a dramatic slowdown or shutdown of that system is considered one of the most dangerous climate tipping points. It could substantially cool Northern Europe, among other wide-ranging effects.\u00a0\u00a0 The tipping of the AMOC itself, however, is not the focus of the ARIA research program.\u00a0 The agency, established last year to \u201cunlock scientific and technological breakthroughs,\u201d is a UK answer to the US\u2019s DARPA and ARPA-E research programs. Other projects it\u2019s funding include efforts to develop precision neurotechnologies, improve robot dexterity, and build safer and more energy-efficient AI systems. ARIA is also setting up programs for developing synthetic plants and exploring climate interventions that could cool the planet, including solar geoengineering.\u00a0 Bohndiek and the other program director of the tipping points program\u2014Gemma Bale, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge\u2014are both medical physicists who previously focused on developing medical devices. At ARIA, they initially expected to work on efforts to decentralize health care.  But Bohndiek says they soon realized that \u201ca lot of these things that need to change at the individual health level will be irrelevant if climate change truly is going to cross these big thresholds.\u201d She adds, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to end up in a society where the world is so much warmer \u2026 does the problem of decentralizing health care matter anymore?\u201d\u00a0 Bohndiek and Bale stress that they hope the program will draw applications from researchers who haven\u2019t traditionally worked on climate change. They add that any research teams proposing to work in or around Greenland must take appropriate steps to engage with local communities, governments, and other research groups. Tipping dangers Efforts are already underway to develop greater understanding of the Subpolar Gyre and the Greenland Ice Sheet, including the likelihood, timing, and consequences of their tipping into different states. There are, for instance, regular field expeditions to measure and refine modeling of ice loss in Greenland. A variety of research groups have set up sensor networks that cross various points of the Atlantic to more closely monitor the shifting conditions of current systems. And several studies have already highlighted the appearance of some \u201cearly warning signals\u201d of a potential collapse of the AMOC in the coming decades.",
    "But the goal of the ARIA program is to accelerate such research efforts and sharpen the field\u2019s focus on improving our ability to predict tipping events.\u00a0 William Johns, an oceanographer focused on observation of the AMOC at the University of Miami, says the field is a long way from being able to state confidently that systems like the Subpolar Gyre or AMOC will weaken beyond the bounds of normal natural fluctuations, much less say with any precision when they would do so.",
    "He stresses that there\u2019s still wide disagreement between models on these sorts of questions and limited evidence of what took place before they tipped in the ancient past, all of which makes it difficult to even know what signals we should be monitoring for most closely. Jaime Palter, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, adds that she found it a \u201cpuzzling\u201d choice to fund a research program focused on the tipping of the Subpolar Gyre. She notes that researchers believe the wind drives the system more than convection, that its connection to the AMOC isn\u2019t well understood, and that the slowdown of the latter system is the one that more of the field is focused on\u2014and more of the world is worried about. But she and Johns both said that providing funds to monitor these systems more closely is critical to improve scientific understanding of how they work and the odds that they will tip. Radical interventions So what could the world do if ARIA or anyone else does manage to develop systems that can predict, with high confidence, that one of these systems will shift into a new state in, say, the next decade? Bohndiek stresses that the effects of reaching a tipping point wouldn\u2019t be immediate, and that the world would still have years or even decades to take actions that might prevent the breakdown of such systems, or begin adapting to the changes they\u2019ll bring. In the case of runaway melting of the ice sheet, that could mean building higher seawalls or relocating cities. In the case of the Subpolar Gyre weakening, big parts of Europe might have to look to other areas of the world for their food supplies. More reliable predictions might also alter people\u2019s thinking about more dramatic interventions, such as massive and hugely expensive engineering projects to prop up ice shelves or to freeze glaciers more stably onto the bedrock they\u2019re sliding upon.",
    "Similarly, they might shift how some people weigh the trade-offs between the dangers of climate change and the risks of interventions like solar geoengineering, which would involve releasing particles in the atmosphere that could reflect more heat back into space. But some observers note that if enough fresh water is pouring into the Atlantic to weaken the gyre and substantially slow the broader Atlantic current system, there\u2019s very little the world can do to stop it. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t really see an action you could take,\u201d Johns says. \u201cYou can\u2019t go vacuum up all the fresh water\u2014it\u2019s not going to be feasible\u2014and you can\u2019t stop it from melting on the scale we\u2019d have to.\u201d Bale readily acknowledges that they\u2019ve selected a very hard problem to solve, but she stresses that the point of ARIA research programs is to work at the \u201cedge of the possible.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe genuinely don\u2019t know if an early warning system for these systems is possible,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think if it is possible, we know that it would be valuable and important for society, and that\u2019s part of our mission.\u201d hide"
