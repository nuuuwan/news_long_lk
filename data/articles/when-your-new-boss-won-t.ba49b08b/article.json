    "It\u2019s normal to feel unsettled when you get a new boss, and it can be especially disorienting if they come in and start making decisions that don\u2019t seem to make sense. What should you do if you\u2019re in this situation? Should you speak up or just take their new...more",
    "The sudden scrapping of a project with no explanation, a surge of meetings flooding your calendar, or the unexpected arrival of a new hire: When your new boss is making hasty decisions without clear justification, your work life feels like it\u2019s been knocked off-kilter.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s professionally frustrating and emotionally exhausting,\u201d says Sharmin Banu, an executive coach based in Seattle. \u201cYou haven\u2019t built trust with this new manager yet, so any goodwill you had initially wears thin.\u201d",
    "Feeling unsettled is normal, but there are constructive things you can do to address your new boss\u2019s rushed decision-making. \u201cGetting a new boss is a moment of transition, but it doesn\u2019t need to be a threat,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Martin, an organizational psychologist and the author of Wrong Fit, Right Fit: Why How We Work Matters More Than Ever.",
    "\u201cYou need to get really good at asking questions, providing information, and offering feedback,\u201d he says. \u201cThink about it as an opportunity to renew your commitment to your organization and build a new relationship.\u201d Here\u2019s what our experts advise.",
    "It\u2019s tough to summon compassion for someone whose rushed decisions are making your job harder, but \u201cput yourself in your new boss\u2019s shoes,\u201d says Banu. \u201cThey\u2019ve just started at a new organization and they\u2019re eager to prove themselves.\u201d",
    "Bear in mind, too, your new boss might be dealing with pressure from higher-ups that you\u2019re not aware of. They may be trying to deliver on promises they made during their interviews, which often means bringing about big changes in a short amount of time, says Martin.",
    "In other words: Your new boss is monumentally stressed. \u201cIn the first 90 days, you\u2019re not seeing them at their best,\u201d says Martin. Assume good intentions and \u201cgive them grace.\u201d",
    "Offer information and support.",
    "In your early conversations with your boss, Martin suggests asking two key questions: \u201cWhat do you need? And how can I help?\u201d Repeat as necessary. Your willingness to provide support creates an environment of \u201copen communication and cooperation\u201d and paves the way for dealing with any decisions that seem premature, he says.",
    "Martin also recommends taking an active role in helping your boss understand the nuances of how the organization operates and team dynamics. \u201cTalk about the rhythm and cadence of how the team has worked to date.\u201d This ensures your boss has the full picture, allowing them to make more informed decisions.",
    "Ask open-ended questions\u2026",
    "When your boss makes a decision that you think is misguided or wrong, resist the urge to scoff or roll your eyes. Instead, Martin recommends asking tactful, open-ended questions to gain clarity on your boss\u2019s reasoning. Questions like: \u201cHow does this help the business?\u201d \u201cWhy is this beneficial for the team?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you trying to achieve?\u201d can be posed in team meetings or during one-on-ones.",
    "Tone is everything, says Banu. Approach the conversation with curiosity and respect. \u201cDon\u2019t sound threatening or accusatory.\u201d She suggests saying something like, \u201cCan you share some of the factors behind this choice?\u201d to demonstrate your willingness to \u201cunderstand and work together.\u201d",
    "\u2026 and provide feedback",
    "Getting a grip on your boss\u2019s motivations puts you in a better position to offer feedback and propose different ideas. Be diplomatic and constructive when expressing reservations, and frame your feedback as a way to achieve shared goals.\u201cEgos are at play, so you need to create a safe space for conversation that conveys the message, \u2018I am with you,\u2019\u201d says Banu. \u201cLook for common ground.\u201d",
    "Martin recommends asking your boss whether they\u2019re willing to hear alternative approaches. \u201cTry saying, \u2018Would you be open to a suggestion that might make this strategy even better?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cMost leaders are going to want to listen.\u201d",
    "Learn from decisions together.",
    "There may still be times where your boss makes a rash decision you disagree with, says Martin. It\u2019s hard, but \u201cultimately, it\u2019s their call.\u201d Even in those cases, Banu suggests talking to your boss about ways the decision could have been handled differently. Don\u2019t complain; focus on continuous improvement. \u201cIf the train has left the station and there\u2019s no going back, all you can do is learn from it together,\u201d Martin says.",
    "Start by expressing your desire to work together. \u201cSay, \u2018I appreciate all that you\u2019re doing to get up to speed and help our team, and I\u2019d like to talk about how we can better support each other in accomplishing our goals,\u201d suggests Martin. Then, explain that you need more resources, inclusion, information, or simply to be kept in the loop earlier in the process. \u201cSpeak their language,\u201d says Banu.",
    "Focus on what you can control.",
    "Learning from past decisions and working with your boss is important, but Martin suggests that there comes a point where it\u2019s necessary to practice acceptance. \u201cConcentrate on what you can control and let go of the rest,\u201d he says. Identify areas where you have influence, and channel your energy into improving day-to-day outcomes for your team.",
    "Take exceptional care of yourself outside work, too, adds Banu. \u201cYou might not realize how draining these situations are and how much they deplete your mental and physical energy.\u201d She recommends getting regular exercise, spending time outdoors, eating well, and practicing mindfulness meditation. \u201cTake advantage of all the self-care tools at your disposal,\u201d she says.",
    "Keep your colleagues close.",
    "Martin recommends talking with your colleagues about the benefits and drawbacks of your boss\u2019s decisions. It\u2019s an opportunity to gauge your team\u2019s perspective and serve as \u201ca gut check\u201d to determine if others share your concerns, he says.",
    "That said, you don\u2019t want these conversations to turn into full-fledged gripe sessions. Keep the tone positive. As Martin says: \u201cIt\u2019s in the team\u2019s best interest to focus on making this person successful. Ultimately, if your boss is great, the team is great.\u201d If issues persist, though, you might need to voice concerns with other leaders. (See below.) \u201cYou\u2019ll have more power in your collective voice,\u201d he notes.",
    "Escalate concerns if necessary.",
    "If your boss is making hurried decisions that are detrimental to the organization, it may be necessary to escalate your concerns to other leaders, according to Martin. For instance, don\u2019t hesitate to speak up if your boss makes a decision that conflicts with the company\u2019s ethics, principles, or values. The same goes if your boss is resistant to asking or answering questions, or they\u2019re unwilling to take feedback about decision-making. Finally, if you have expertise or a strategic perspective you believe is vital to the business\u2019s success, \u201cdon\u2019t sit on your hands,\u201d he says. Remember: Your priority is the long-term well-being of the organization.",
    "Consider cutting your losses.",
    "It\u2019s possible that your boss is inexperienced, lacking in self-awareness, or ill-equipped for the role. Or maybe they\u2019re simply not a good fit for you, says Martin. \u201cWe all have preferred ways of working, and it could be that this new boss\u2019s decision-making style isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but it\u2019s different from what you want.\u201d",
    "If, despite your best efforts, nothing seems to be changing, and your boss continues to make questionable decisions, Martin suggests some self-reflection. \u201cThings change, and priorities shift, but you need to decide whether you want to be part of the next chapter,\u201d he says. Banu recommends asking yourself a simple question: \u201cDo I want to work in this environment?\u201d If not, it might be time to start looking for a different job.",
    "Show your new boss compassion and assume good intentions. They\u2019re under pressure to prove themselves and deliver on promises, so they need a bit of grace.",
    "Ask your boss what they need and how you can help, and take the initiative to explain team dynamics so they can make more informed decisions.",
    "Understand your boss\u2019s motivations to offer more effective feedback. Be diplomatic, find common ground, and ask if they\u2019re open to alternative ideas.",
    "Roll your eyes or scoff when you disagree with your boss. Instead, ask open-ended questions to understand their reasoning and demonstrate you\u2019re open to collaboration.",
    "Complain or gossip about your boss with colleagues. Instead, discuss decisions to gauge their perspective and stay positive.",
    "Hesitate to escalate concerns to other leaders if your boss\u2019s hasty decisions conflict with company values.",
