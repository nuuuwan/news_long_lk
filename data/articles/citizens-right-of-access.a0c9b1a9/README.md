In terms of the aforesaid statutory entitlement, I wish to be provided with the undernoted information and clarifications, which are lawfully sought by me connected with the due public interest assessment of national economic/monetary stability and good governance-related public interest information in respect of the bi-lateral external debt settlements, following the recently concluded debt restructure:
