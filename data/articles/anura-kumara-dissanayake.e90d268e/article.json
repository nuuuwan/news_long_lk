    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake being sworn in as the President on 24 September 2024 - File photo",
    "When Anura was six months old, his mother went to an astrologer to cast his horoscope. The astrologer made some calculations based on planetary movements that prevailed at the time of the boy\u2019s birth and told the mother \u201cyour son has a \u201cRajayoga\u201d in his destiny. He is born to rule. One day he will rule this country.\u201d The mother Seelawathi was pleased but puzzled. How could my son be a ruler? She wondered",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was elected last year as Sri Lanka\u2019s ninth Executive President\u00a0 celebrated his 57th\u00a0birthday early\u00a0 this week on 24 November.\u00a0Unlike some past presidents who celebrated their birthdays ostentatiously with Poojas and parties, President Dissanayake chose to observe his birthday as simply another \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d day without publicity or fanfare.",
    "This was in keeping with the public persona of\u00a0President Dissanayake known popularly as Anura and AKD",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was elected last year as Sri Lanka\u2019s ninth Executive President\u00a0 \u00a0celebrated his 57th birthday early\u00a0 this week on 24 November.\u00a0 Unlike some past presidents who celebrated their birthdays ostentatiously with Poojas and parties, President Dissanayake\u00a0 chose to observe his birthday as simply another \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d day without publicity or fanfare. This was in keeping with the public persona of\u00a0 President Dissanayake known popularly as Anura and AKD.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake or AKD\u2019s rise from humble beginnings to the pinnacle of power\u00a0 has in recent times captured the imagination of the Sri Lankan public in a big way.. He is generally perceived as a simple ,unassuming man intent on serving the people who elected him to office.",
    "AKD\u2019s double -pocketed long sleeve shirts are becoming a fad with sections of his youthful admirers. Anura\u2019s simple yet effective functional style has helped him acquire\u00a0 \u201ca President like no other\u201d image within a relatively short time. It is in this context that this column focuses -with the aid of earlier writings-\u00a0 on AKD\u00a0 and his\u00a0 Presidential journey this week.",
    "Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara Dissanayake was born on 24 November 1968. His birthplace was Galewala in the Matale district of the Central Province. Both his father Ran Banda Dissanayake and mother Seelawathi were of Kandyan Govigama Buddhist stock. The family relocated to the Anuradhapura district in the North Central Province when Anura and his elder sister Sriyalatha were children. After residing in Kekirawa for a few years, the family moved to Thambuthegama situated in an agrarian region in the Kalawewa electoral division of the province.",
    "Thambuththegama\u00a0 is about 25 km away from Anuradhapura town and 190 km from Colombo city.Anura completed his primary education at\u00a0 Gamini Maha Vidyalaya and secondary education at Thambuththegama Central College. Anura brought great credit to his Alma Mater when he made history as the first student of Thambuththegama Central College to gain admission to the Peradeniya University science faculty.",
    "Anura\u2019s father Ran Banda was essentially an agricultural worker. After several years, he\u00a0 obtained permanent employment in the Surveyors department as an office aide. At times, Dissanayake snr would accompany surveyors on field\u00a0 assignments carrying\u00a0 equipment.",
    "Anura\u2019s mother Seelawathie\u00a0 was a housewife who obtained periodic employment during paddy planting and harvesting seasons.",
    "When Anura was six months old, his mother went to an astrologer to cast his horoscope. The astrologer made some calculations based on planetary movements that prevailed at the time of the boy\u2019s birth and told the mother \u201cyour son has a \u201cRajayoga\u201d in his destiny. He is born to rule. One day he will rule this country.\u201d The mother Seelawathi was pleased but puzzled. How could my son be a ruler? She wondered.",
    "When Anura celebrated his 12th birthday, the chief incumbent of a Buddhist temple or Viharadhipthy wanted him to be a novice monk and be ordained a member of the Buddhist clergy. The elderly monk had been impressed by the boy\u2019s demeanour, intelligence and good conduct. After much thought the parents respectfully declined to do so.",
    "The family was\u00a0 financially challenged\u00a0 in the early years after moving to Thambuththegama. Their wattle and daub cottage\u00a0 had no electricity. Young Anura would study at night with the aid of a kerosene lamp.\u00a0 In his boyhood Anura would perch himself on a branch of an \u201cAraliya\u201d tree (Temple Tree) and read. According to his mother, Anura would be reading a book or a newspaper even while eating.",
    "In order to augment the family income, Anura\u2019s mother would make sweetmeats. The son would take them as well as toffees and mangoes\u00a0 to the nearby Thambuththegama railway station\u00a0 and sell them to passengers on long distance trains such as the \u201cYarl Devi\u201d, \u201cUttara Devi\u201d and \u201cRajarata Rajani\u201d. He would at times\u00a0 climb aboard the trains and move from compartment to compartment selling his stuff. During school holidays, Anura would be employed part -time as a ditch digger and be paid twenty rupees a day.",
    "Despite economic hardship, Anura\u00a0 shone brightly as a student. He\u00a0 had great powers of comprehension and would grasp the finer points in the texts easily. He also had a good memory. Anura brought great credit to his Alma Mater when he made history as the first student of Thambuththegama Central College to gain admission to the Peradeniya university science faculty.",
    "Some weeks before the\u00a0 2024 presidential election, Anura was felicitated by staff and students at his old school. While speaking Anura made an observation that resonated with his audience. Anura compared himself to the top three Presidential candidates (Ranil,Sajith and Namal) and said that\u00a0 he, a student of Thambuththegama Central College, was competing with\u00a0 his rivals\u00a0 educated at posh Colombo schools. At the hustings Thambuthegama triumphed over Colombo.",
    "The president in the making was\u00a0 an avid reader during his student and undergraduate days. (he still is). In a media interview given some years ago, AKD was asked about the books he liked.\u00a0 Some of the books mentioned by Anura were \u201cWar and Peace\u201d by Leo Tolstoy, \u201cThe Mother\u201d by Maxim Gorky, \u201cSenkottan\u201d by Mahinda Prasad Masimbula and \u201cAdaraneeya Victoria\u201d by Mohan Raj Madawala. He further said that there were a number of short stories he liked.",
    "Anura\u00a0 also said that during schooldays he used to read about the work done by Dr. Abraham Kovoor. Dr. Kovoor a native of Thiruvalla in Kerala, India moved to Sri Lanka and taught for many years at St.Thomas\u2019 College Mt.Lavinia. He was the president of the Rationalist Association and did much work in combating superstition, pseudo Godmen and falsehoods in the name of religion.",
    "AKD enjoys reading biographies and auto-biographies of great thinkers and political leaders. Among those renowned persons whose life stories have enriched Anura\u2019s life are\u00a0 Marx, Engels, Lenin, Gandhi, Tito, Castro and Clinton.",
    "Speaking further in the interview AKD said \u201cThere are many books that changed my life.I was deeply inspired by the literature of Soviet Russia. Novels and short stories. The literature of that period had a great impact on our lives.\u201d",
    "Anura\u2019s love of reading and acknowledgement of the impact of books on his life does not mean that\u00a0 he is a nerdy bookworm alone. People seeing him in person and on electronic screens would have noted the \u201cathlete\u201d in him. His brisk walk and the ease with which he mounts stages are strikingly noteworthy. The genesis of this physical fitness lies in the waters of Anuradhapura.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake who learnt to swim in the Nallaachiya Lake near his home is a very good swimmer\u00a0 who combines\u00a0 speed and stamina.\u00a0 In his\u00a0 student days, Anura would swim in the three historic\u00a0 tanks of Anuradhaura -Tissa Wewa, Abaya Wewa and Nuwara Wewa.\u00a0 He would often swim\u00a0 the entire length (3 km) of\u00a0 Nuwara Wewa tank\u00a0 constructed\u00a0 by King Valagamba in the first century.",
    "Later on as a political activist, Anura travelled throughout Sri Lanka. He would swim in\u00a0 tanks, lakes , rivers\u00a0 and the sea wherever and whenever possible. \u201cI love to swim. On average, I swim about two kilometers. So a swimming pool isn\u2019t enough for me. To be honest, I don\u2019t like swimming pools,\u201d he\u00a0 told an interviewer once.",
    "From the idyllic existence of swimming, reading and studying Anura Kumara came of\u00a0 age politically in\u00a0 his\u00a0 late teens. 1987 was the year of war, peace and war. It was\u00a0 also the year that changed Anura\u2019s life utterly.",
    "The India-Sri Lanka Accord was signed by former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and ex-Sri Lanka president Junius Richard (JR) Jayewardene on 29 July 1987 in Colombo. A ceasefire was declared and Indian army personnel described as the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) were stationed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the island to maintain peace.",
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led by Rohana Wijeweera opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord and engaged in armed resistance in the predominantly Sinhala areas. The JVP had in 1971 launched an armed insurrection when the United Front Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was in power. It was cruelly and brutally crushed. This is commonly referred to as the first JVP insurgency.",
    "When the Indo-Lanka accord was signed and the IPKF was stationed in the North and East, the JVP revived atavistic fears of the various invasions by Indian kings in the past and commenced an anti-Indian struggle in the Sinhala majority provinces. This was termed as the second JVP insurgency.",
    "It was in this situation that 19-year-old Anura Kumara Dissanayake joined the JVP in 1987 along with his first cousin Sunil Dissanayake. \u201cSunil Aiya\u201d as Anura called him, had a great influence on Anura\u2019s life. It was Sunil who was instrumental in convincing Anura that they should join the JVP for the motherland\u2019s sake.",
    "Anura\u2019s love of reading and acknowledgement of the impact of books on his life does not mean that\u00a0 he is a nerdy bookworm alone. People seeing him in person and on electronic screens would have noted the \u201cathlete\u201d in him. His brisk walk and the ease with which he mounts stages are strikingly noteworthy. The genesis of this physical fitness lies in the waters of Anuradhapura",
    "When Anura joined the JVP, he was a GCE (AL) student. Some months later, Anura gained admission to the University of Peradeniya. Anura moved to Kandy and commenced his varsity education. But he devoted most of his time to clandestine political activity. Anura adopted the nom de guerre \u201cAravinda\u201d and engaged in pro-JVP activities.",
    "The terror unleashed by the JVP was matched by the counter terror of the state. Anura\u2019s cousin Sunil was among the thousands of youths killed through State terror. Anura, known as Aravinda fled from Peradeniya and went into hiding. He became a wanted man. Anura\u2019s non-political family was then living in a modest brick house. Agents of the State reportedly burnt the house down as a warning to \u201cAravinda\u201d.",
    "Anura dropped out of varsity and went underground. According to JVP circles Anura maintained a low profile and moved from place to place. This period was arguably the most dangerous phase in his life.",
    "Anura kept away from home during this time. When Anura\u2019s father Ran Banda Dissanayake died the security officials expected the son to attend the funeral and were lying in wait in the vicinity. Anticipating such a trap, Anura kept away and was not able to attend his own father\u2019s funeral.",
    "Somawansa Amerasinghe",
    "The JVP\u2019s second insurgency was ruthlessly suppressed by the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime. The only senior top leader and Politburo member to survive was Somawansa Amerasinghe alias Siri Aiyaa. He became the fourth JVP leader. Somawansa escaped to India in 1990 and from there went to Thailand. He later travelled to Italy and from there sought political asylum in France.",
    "After Premadasa\u2019s death in May 1993, the political climate changed for the better as far as the JVP was concerned. Somawansa Amerasinghe returned to Sri Lanka in 1994 and began re-organising the JVP quietly.",
    "Meanwhile Anura had resumed his tertiary studies again. He was an undergraduate at the Kelaniya University in 1992. Anura adopted a low profile during his undergraduate days but participated in student union activity. He also conducted classes at a tutorial institution. AKD completed his studies and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree (BSc) in Physical Science in 1995. Instead of seeking full time employment AKD turned to full time politics.",
    "As mentioned earlier, Somawansa had returned to Sri Lanka and was engaged in reviving the JVP. Anura was in contact with Somawansa and used to convey confidential messages from him to other JVP members. Somawansa liked Anura and was impressed by the young man\u2019s intellect, ability and convictions. He took Anura under his wing.",
    "The JVP backed Socialist Students Union was re-organised in 1995 after the national convention at Tangalle. AKD was appointed National Organiser. Thereafter his rise was rapid within JVP ranks. In 1996 he became a member of the JVP central committee. AKD was elevated to the all-powerful JVP Politburo (Political Bureau) in 1998.",
    "When the JVP contested Parliamentary polls in 2000, AKD was placed on the national list so that he could engage in propaganda all over instead of being tied down to the district as a candidate. He had blossomed into an able speaker. Anura was a direct, straight to the point kind of speaker who appealed to reason. Sometimes he was emotional too.",
    "Thus in 2000 AKD was appointed as national list MP and entered Parliament for the first time. In 2001 Anura was re-appointed as national list MP for the second time. Soon AKD made his mark as a powerful orator and skilful debater in Parliament.",
    "The JVP contested as part of the SLFP led United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the 2004 elections. The JVP obtained 39 MP seats in the 2004 election. Anura contested in the Kurunegala district on the UPFA ticket. He was elected with 153,868 preference votes. When President Kumaratunga formed the cabinet, four portfolios were allocated to the JVP. Anura was appointed as the cabinet minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation.",
    "Unfortunately matters took a different turn. Anura\u2019s ministerial duties came to an abrupt end. Dissanayake along with other JVP colleagues in the UPFA Government resigned their posts. All 39 MPs of the JVP quit the Government.",
    "As years progressed, the JVP began losing its vigour and vitality. It was becoming increasingly clear that the JVP required a new sense of direction under a fresh leader if it were to survive as a political force. The veteran leader Somawansa Amersinghe realised that he needed to step down and began dropping hints that he would retire soon.",
    "The JVP\u2019s 17th national convention was held on 2 February 2014. Somawansa stepped down as leader and proposed that Anura Kumara Dissanayake replace him. It was approved unanimously. Somawansa had appreciated the potential in Anura years ago and had groomed him as his successor. A.K. Dissanayake became the JVP\u2019s fifth leader 11 years ago in February 2014.",
    "After protracted consultations with external elements and prolonged internal discussions the JVP resolved to form a broad alliance or front. The JVP would remain the pivotal power in that alliance and maintain its position of pre-eminence. Overtly the JVP would be the first among equals (Primus Inter Pares) in the new set up. Covertly the JVP would be in control.",
    "When the Indo-Lanka accord was signed and the IPKF was stationed in the North and East, the JVP revived atavistic fears of the various invasions by Indian kings in the past and commenced an anti-Indian struggle in the Sinhala majority provinces. This was termed as the second JVP insurgency. It was in this situation that 19-year-old Anura Kumara Dissanayake joined the JVP in 1987 along with his first cousin Sunil Dissanayake. \u201cSunil Aiya\u201d as Anura called him, had a great influence on Anura\u2019s life. It was Sunil who was instrumental in convincing Anura that they should join the JVP for the motherland\u2019s sake",
    "Jathika Jana Balawegaya",
    "And so the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) or National People\u2019s Power (NPP) was born. On 13 July 2019, hundreds of political activists converged at the BMICH in Colombo. The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) known in Tamil as the Thesiya Makkal Sakthi (TMS) was formally launched following a motion proposed by Anura Dissanayake and seconded by Tilvin Silva.",
    "JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was elected as leader of the NPP also. The NPP General Secretary was Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe. Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and Lal Wijenayake were the Deputy Secretaries. The Treasurer was Eranga Gunasekara.",
    "Sri Lanka\u00a0 underwent the unprecedented experience of the \u201cAragalaya\u201d (struggle) in 2022. The NPP too tapped into the popular anger against the ruling regime in general and the Rajapaksas in particular. Ultimately the Rajapaksas were ousted from power.",
    "Anura made an incisive analysis of the changed situation with the aid of pro-JVP academics, analysts and opinion makers. He recognised that the people in general and youths in particular were yearning for a change. Some called it a system change. None seemed sure or clear about what this change was likely to be. The JVP/NPP led by AKD defined this change as a change of those in power from the presidency to Parliament.",
    "The JVP-NPP felt the situation was ideal for political advancement by aiming for the presidency in a big way. It was a foregone conclusion that AKD would be the NPP Presidential candidate.",
    "Presidential candidate",
    "The NPP geared itself up for the 2024 Presidential election. The JVP led NPP began to assiduously promote Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s Presidential candidacy. Anura refurbished his image and re-invented the political approach of his party.",
    "Thereafter the JVP led NPP began a push -pull approach. On the one hand it widely encouraged\u00a0 the yearning for change\u00a0 while on the other that yearning was channelled into a demand for political change. The JVP/NPP used the\u00a0 Compass symbol as its symbol for change. Countless video\u00a0 clips promoting the \u201cMalimawa\u201d and \u201cThisaikaatti\u201d as harbingers of change were propagated in Sinhala and Tamil\u00a0 over social media and YouTube.",
    "In the process, two passions came to the fore. One was anger and hatred\u00a0 against the privileged classes and those in power.\u00a0 The other was sympathy and empathy for the under-privileged and powerless people. The Presidential election was going to be an undeclared war between the haves and have- nots. The goal was a victory for the\u00a0 proverbial common man. AKD was projected as both a champion\u00a0 for change\u00a0 as well as an agent of change.",
    "AKD fitted the bill perfectly. He had rugged good looks, an amiable disposition and a flair for effective oratory. He had a knack for establishing instant rapport with his varied audiences be it the Udarata,Rajarata, Ruhuna, Vadakku or Kizhakku.",
    "He spoke simply yet elegantly in a conversational style. He would pose questions and then proceed to answer them.",
    "There was also feeling and empathy when he spoke about the particular problems faced by segments of the people\u00a0 and their sufferings as well as their aspirations. His was a tone of sincerity coupled with the ring of authenticity. The Audience were both touched and impressed.",
    "This enabled Anura to spearhead a commendable political renaissance of the JVP led NPP. As is well known, Anura Kumara Dissanayake finished first in the Presidential election held on 24 September 2024. AKD polled 5,634,915 (42.31%) votes on the first count and 5,740,179 (55.89%) on the second count. It was truly a famous victory.",
