    "Over one quarter of workplace meetings leave employees with lingering negative effects such as lowered engagement and productivity that can last hours. This is called a meeting hangover.\u00a0To avoid the effects of a meeting hangover, those running meetings should: facilitate meetings to bring in everyone\u2019s voices, keep meetings small, create action plans instead of agendas, use time wisely and respectfully, demand accountability, and proactively identify steps to address any concerns. If you experience a bad meeting, to avoid a hangover: take a mental break; take a physical break, if you can; and meet with colleagues to discuss and explore what went wrong.",
    "Jacob shut his laptop with a heavy sigh, rubbing his temples as the meeting he left almost an hour ago replayed again in his mind. No matter how hard he tried to refocus, his anger at the meeting\u2019s disorganization and pointlessness kept distracting him. He had already postponed the one-on-one scheduled immediately afterwards because he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate\u2014how much more time was he going to lose to this? But the meeting had been so maddening. Certain team members took over the discussion and as a result no decisions had been made\u2014nothing productive had come out of the full hour. And it wasn\u2019t the first time. The experience left him disheartened and uninterested in working on the project altogether. It ultimately took hours for him to shake off his frustrations and regain the momentum he\u2019d started with that morning.",
