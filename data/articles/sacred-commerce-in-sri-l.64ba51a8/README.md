Rituals such as almsgiving, blessings, healing ceremonies, and annual temple festivals require goods, decorations, transport, catering, music, and labour, stimulating a host of related industries and small enterprises. As a result, the ritual economy not only sustains spiritual and cultural traditions but also supports livelihoods, fosters entrepreneurship, and contributes positively to local economies throughout the island – Dr. Rita Langer

Ritual economy is the way economic activities, such as production, distribution, and consumption are deeply embedded in and shaped by religious or ceremonial practices. Rather than being driven purely by profit or utility, transactions in a ritual economy serve to reinforce social relationships, cultural values, and spiritual beliefs. Goods and services may be exchanged not just for material benefit but also to fulfil sacred obligations, gain spiritual merit, or maintain cosmic balance. This system often involves offerings, sacrifices, or feasting, where economic resources are used to express devotion, status, or communal solidarity, highlighting the inseparable link between the sacred and the material in many societies.

The Sri Lankan context

In the Sri Lankan context, ritual economy plays a vital role in sustaining cultural traditions, religious institutions, and social cohesion across communities. Deeply rooted in Buddhist, Hindu, and indigenous beliefs, economic activities surrounding rituals, such as temple offerings, almsgiving (dāna), annual cultural and festive processions (peraheras), and ancestral worship mobilise resources not merely for religious merit but also to affirm community identity and hierarchy. Donations to temples, sponsorship of rituals, and the exchange of goods during festival periods foster reciprocal relationships between laypeople, clergy, and local artisans. This blending of spiritual and economic practices supports a cycle where faith reinforces economic flows, and economic contributions, in turn, reinforce spiritual and social obligations. Ritual economy in Sri Lanka strengthens the interplay between religion, economy, and society.

“Ritual economy is deeply woven into the fabric of daily life in Sri Lanka, playing a significant role in both cultural preservation and socio-economic development. It encompasses a wide range of participants, including laypeople, Buddhist monks and nuns, clergy from other religions, traditional ritual specialists such as exorcists (kaṭṭaṇḍiyas), and numerous supporting individuals highlighting its inclusive and far-reaching nature. Some of those involved in these practices receive payment for their services, thereby generating income and creating part-time or even full-time employment opportunities.

“Rituals such as almsgiving, blessings, healing ceremonies, and annual temple festivals require goods, decorations, transport, catering, music, and labour, stimulating a host of related industries and small enterprises. As a result, the ritual economy not only sustains spiritual and cultural traditions but also supports livelihoods, fosters entrepreneurship, and contributes positively to local economies throughout the island,” says United Kingdom’s University of Bristol Department of Religion and Theology Senior Lecturer in Buddhist Studies Dr. Rita Langer.

According to Dr. Langer, international events such as the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Vesak Festival and the Kandy Esala Perahera are among the key components of Sri Lanka’s ritual economy, attracting thousands of foreign visitors and significantly boosting the country’s travel and tourism sector. The grand cultural and religious celebrations not only showcase Sri Lanka’s rich spiritual heritage but also generate widespread economic activity across various sectors, including hospitality, transportation, handicrafts, and food services. “These festivals are part of a seasonal ritual economy and their cyclical nature creates recurring economic opportunities while strengthening cultural identity and international appeal,” she says.

Moral, spiritual, and social value

The ritual economy also significantly contributes to fostering a spiritually enriched society, which ultimately reinforces the overall socio-economic foundation of a nation. In a country like Sri Lanka, where religion and cultural rituals are deeply interwoven with daily life, the ritual economy serves not only as a mechanism for spiritual fulfilment but also as a platform for moral guidance, communal bonding, and economic participation. Through acts such as almsgiving, temple offerings, ‘Dan Sel’ at Poya days and other religiously important days, healing rituals, and religious festivals, individuals and communities engage in practices that promote compassion, generosity, and ethical living; core values that contribute to social harmony and mutual respect. These practices also provide livelihood opportunities for a wide range of people, from artisans and performers to food vendors and transport providers, thereby promoting inclusive economic growth.

Moreover, by encouraging regular engagement with spiritual practices, the ritual economy helps cultivate a sense of inner peace and collective well-being, which are essential foundations for a stable and resilient society. Thus, the ritual economy not only nurtures spiritual consciousness but also reinforces a sense of purpose and solidarity that supports long-term socio-economic progress.

Youth engagement and women as custodians of tradition

“It is increasingly evident that a growing number of young people and youth groups in Sri Lanka are actively involved in organising ‘Dan Sel’ – almsgiving pavilions, offering free meals to passers-by, reflecting a meaningful shift in social values. This emerging trend signifies more than just charitable action; it embodies a modern expression of empathy and a conscious effort to cultivate inner peace and fulfilment. The enthusiastic participation of youth in Buddhist festivals and temple events marks a notable departure from traditional perceptions that often placed such responsibilities solely on older generations.

“Even within a highly capitalistic socio-economic environment, young individuals are engaging in acts of selfless giving, providing alms to monks, distributing food to hospital patients, and supporting underprivileged schoolchildren, without expecting material or direct returns. For me, preparing food for others is a powerful form of meditation, one that transcends the traditional, narrow definitions; yet it is often overlooked due to the lack of recognition of the deep connection between ritual practices and contemplative states. However, these actions highlight a deeper moral and spiritual commitment, suggesting that generosity, when practiced collectively, serves as a powerful force for reinforcing communal values, social cohesion, and a more compassionate society,” Dr. Langer emphasises.

She also acknowledges that a significant portion of ritual activities in Sri Lanka are either performed by or heavily involve women. “In many urban, semi-urban, and rural communities across the country, rituals such as ‘Kiri Ammā Dāna’ and ‘Paththini Dāna’ are widely practiced and are predominantly centred on women. These ceremonies, deeply rooted in Sri Lanka’s intangible cultural heritage, highlight the central role women play in preserving and perpetuating traditional, religious and cultural practices. As custodians of this heritage, women not only ensure the continuity of these rituals but also pass them down through generations, fostering cultural resilience and spiritual continuity. Their active participation in the ritual economy not only strengthens community identity but also reinforces the socio-cultural foundation of Sri Lanka,” she explains.

The role of the village

and unspoiled tradition

Her emphasis is that the village plays a vital role in sustaining and promoting Sri Lanka’s cultural and ritual economy, serving as the heartland where age-old traditions are preserved and practiced. “Buddhism, in particular, is a driving force behind these ritual activities, shaping the spiritual and social foundation of village life. However, the expression of ritual economy in Sri Lanka differs from that of other predominantly Buddhist nations such as Thailand and Myanmar while those countries have successfully integrated ritual practices into mainstream socio-economic development, Sri Lanka’s unique status as an island nation has influenced a slower, more conservative progression over the past four decades,” she says.

According to Dr. Langer, unlike the heavily commercialised spiritual tourism seen in some other countries, Sri Lanka’s ritual economy remains more community-based and less influenced by mass tourism. The island has not been overwhelmed by global tourism trends, allowing its cultural and religious practices to remain relatively unspoiled. This distinction gives Sri Lanka a more grounded and intimate approach to ritual economy, preserving its integrity while still offering potential for sustainable cultural tourism.

Recognising the impact of ritual economy is essential to understanding and advancing Sri Lanka’s socio-economic development. Rooted in centuries-old traditions and practices, it not only sustains spiritual and cultural life but also creates livelihoods, fosters social cohesion, and strengthens community resilience. From youth engagement and women’s leadership to village-centred practices and sustainable tourism, the ritual economy offers a unique, holistic model of development that blends the sacred with the economic. Embracing and investing in this model can lead to more inclusive, ethical, and culturally grounded pathways for national progress.

“Without charity, any society will collapse,” Dr. Rita concludes.
