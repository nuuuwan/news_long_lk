Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing phishing attacks, making them more efficient and successful, according to a recent study. The research found that 60% of subjects fell victim to AI-assisted phishing, a rate equal to manually executed phishing. The study also showed that the entire phishing operation can be automated using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude, which generates human-like text, thereby reducing the effort and cost of phishing attacks by more than 95%. As a result, the scale and quality of phishing attacks are likely to surge.

The researchers tested different types of phishing emails: those manually crafted by human experts; AI-generated; and semi-automated. In their experiment, they found varying click-through rates for different email types. GPT-4-generated emails attracted a 37% click rate, 74% for human-created emails, and 62% for those generated by both GPT-4 and humans.

The researchers suggest that businesses should prepare for potential AI-enhanced spear phishing attacks by understanding the asymmetrical capabilities of such attacks, calculating the threat severity, and reviewing current phishing awareness and defense strategies. However, they also found that AI could be used to detect phishing emails, with some models offering excellent recommendations on how to respond to potential threats. 

Furthermore, certain AI models exhibited an improved capability for detecting phishing emails, sometimes outperforming human detection rates.
