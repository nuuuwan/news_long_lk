    "When Jim O\u2019Neill was nominated to be the second in command at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dylan Livingston was excited. As founder and CEO of the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI), Livingston is a member of a community that seeks to extend human lifespan. O\u2019Neill is \u201ckind of one of us,\u201d he told me shortly before O\u2019Neill was sworn in as deputy secretary on June 9. \u201cAnd now [he\u2019s] in a position of great influence.\u201d As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new right-hand man, O\u2019Neill is expected to wield authority at health agencies that fund biomedical research and oversee the regulation of new drugs. And while O\u2019Neill doesn\u2019t subscribe to Kennedy\u2019s most contentious beliefs\u2014and supports existing vaccine schedules\u2014he may still steer the agencies in controversial new directions.\u00a0 Related StoryThe first US hub for experimental medical treatments is comingMontana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA.",
    "Although much less of a public figure than his new boss, O\u2019Neill is quite well-known in the increasingly well-funded and tight-knit longevity community. His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who describes him as \u201ca soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,\u201d and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.\u00a0 In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O\u2019Neill, it\u2019s clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O\u2019Neill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs.",
    "This idea is bolstered not just by his personal and professional relationships but also by his past statements and history working at aging-focused organizations\u2014all of which suggest he indeed believes scientists should be working on ways to extend human lifespan beyond its current limits and thinks unproven therapies should be easier to access. He has also supported the libertarian idea of creating new geographic zones, possibly at sea, in which residents can live by their own rules (including, notably, permissive regulatory regimes for new drugs and therapies).\u00a0 \u201cIn [the last three administrations] there weren\u2019t really people like that from our field taking these positions of power,\u201d says Livingston, adding that O\u2019Neill\u2019s elevation is \u201cdefinitely something to be excited about.\u201d",
    "Not everyone working in health is as enthusiastic, particularly when it comes to any potential changes to drug testing and approvals. If O\u2019Neill still holds the views he has espoused over the years, that\u2019s \u201cworrisome,\u201d says Diana Zuckerman, a health policy analyst and president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than getting a bunch of [early-stage unproven therapies] on the market,\u201d she says. Those products might be dangerous and could make people sick while enriching those who develop or sell them.\u00a0 \u201cGetting things on the market quickly means that everybody becomes a guinea pig,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way those of us who care about health care think.\u201d\u00a0 The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen puts it far more bluntly, describing O\u2019Neill as \u201cone of Trump\u2019s worst picks\u201d and saying that he is \u201cunfit to be the #2 US health-care leader.\u201d His libertarian views are \u201cantithetical to basic public health,\u201d the organization\u2019s co-president said in a statement. Neither O\u2019Neill nor HHS responded to requests for comment.\u00a0  \u201cOne of us\u201d As deputy secretary of HHS, O\u2019Neill will oversee a number of agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the world\u2019s biggest funder of biomedical research; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country\u2019s public health agency; and the Food and Drug Administration, which was created to ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective.\u00a0 \u201cIt can be a quite powerful position,\u201d says Patricia Zettler, a legal scholar at Ohio State University who specializes in drug regulation and the FDA.

    "It is the most senior role O\u2019Neill has held at HHS, though it\u2019s not the first. He occupied various positions in the department over five years during the early 2000s, according to his LinkedIn profile. But it is what he did after that has helped him cultivate a reputation as an ally for longevity enthusiasts.\u00a0 O\u2019Neill appears to have had a close relationship with Thiel since at least the late 2000s. Thiel has heavily invested in longevity research and has said he does not believe that death is inevitable. In 2011 O\u2019Neill referred to Thiel as his \u201cfriend and patron.\u201d (A representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.)",
    "O\u2019Neill also served as CEO of the Thiel Foundation between 2009 and 2012 and cofounded the Thiel Fellowship, which offers $200,000 to promising young people if they drop out of college and do other work. And he spent seven years as managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a \u201cfamily of long-term venture capital funds\u201d founded by Thiel, according to O\u2019Neill\u2019s LinkedIn profile.\u00a0 O\u2019Neill got further stitched into the longevity field when he spent more than a decade representing Thiel\u2019s interests as a board member of the SENS Research Foundation (SRF), an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, to which Thiel was a significant donor.\u00a0 O\u2019Neill even spent a couple of years as CEO of SRF, from 2019 to 2021, when its founder Aubrey de Grey, a prominent figure in the longevity field, was removed following accusations of sexual harassment. As CEO, O\u2019Neill oversaw a student education program and multiple scientific research projects that focused on various aspects of aging, according to the organization\u2019s annual reports. And in a 2020 SRF annual report, O\u2019Neill wrote that Eric Hargan, then the deputy secretary of HHS, had attended an SRF conference to discuss \u201cregulatory reform.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMore and more influential people consider aging an absurdity,\u201d he wrote in the report. \u201cNow we need to make it one.\u201d\u00a0  While de Grey calls him \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d\u2014probably because he believes O\u2019Neill \u201cincited\u201d two women to make sexual harassment allegations against him\u2014the many other scientists, biotech CEOs, and other figures in the longevity field contacted by MIT Technology Review had more positive opinions of O\u2019Neill, with many claiming they were longtime friends or acquaintances of the new deputy secretary (though, at the same time, many were reluctant to share specific views about his past work).\u00a0 Longevity science is a field that\u2019s long courted controversy, owing largely to far-fetched promises of immortality and the ongoing marketing of creams, pills, intravenous infusions, and other so-called anti-aging treatments that are not supported by evidence. But the community includes people along a spectrum of beliefs (with the goals of adding a few years of healthy lifespan to the population at one end and immortality at the other), and serious doctors and scientists are working to bring legitimacy to the field.\u00a0 Pretty much everyone in the field that I spoke with appears to be hopeful about what O\u2019Neill will do now that he\u2019s been confirmed. Namely, they hope he will use his new position to direct attention and funds to legitimate longevity research and the development of new drugs that might slow or reverse human aging.\u00a0 Related StoryThe quest to legitimize longevity medicineLongevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there\u2019s a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.",
    "Johnson, whose extreme and expensive approaches to extending his own lifespan have made him something of a celebrity, calls O\u2019Neill a friend and says they\u2019ve \u201cknown each other for a little over 15 years.\u201d He says he can imagine O\u2019Neill setting a goal to extend the lifespans of Americans.",
    "Eric Verdin, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, says O\u2019Neill has \u201cbeen at the Buck several times\u201d and calls him \u201ca good guy\u201d\u2014someone who is \u201cserious\u201d and who understands the science of aging. He says, \u201cHe\u2019s certainly someone who is going to help us to really bring the longevity field to the front of the priorities of this administration.\u201d Celine Halioua, CEO of the biotech company Loyal, which is developing drugs to extend the lifespan of dogs, echoes these sentiments, saying she has \u201calways liked and respected\u201d O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt\u2019ll definitely be nice to have somebody who\u2019s bought into the thesis [of longevity science] at the FDA,\u201d she says.",
    "And Joe Betts-LaCroix, CEO of the longevity biotech company Retro Biosciences, says he\u2019s known O\u2019Neill for something like 10 years and describes him as \u201csmart and clear thinking.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve mutually been part of poetry readings,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s been definitely interested in wanting us as a society to make progress on age-related disease.\u201d After his confirmation, the A4LI LinkedIn account posted a photo of Livingston, its CEO, with O\u2019Neill, writing that \u201cwe look forward to working with him to elevate aging research as a national priority and to modernize regulatory pathways that support the development of longevity medicines.\u201d  \u201cHis work at SENS Research Foundation [suggests] to me and to others that [longevity] is going to be something that he prioritizes,\u201d Livingston says. \u201cI think he\u2019s a supporter of this field, and that\u2019s really all that matters right now to us.\u201d Changing the rules While plenty of treatments have been shown to slow aging in lab animals, none of them have been found to successfully slow or reverse human aging. And many longevity enthusiasts believe drug regulations are to blame.\u00a0 O\u2019Neill is one of them. He has long supported deregulation of new drugs and medical devices. During his first tour at HHS, for instance, he pushed back against regulations on the use of algorithms in medical devices. \u201cFDA had to argue that an algorithm \u2026 is a medical device,\u201d he said in a 2014 presentation at a meeting on \u201crejuvenation biotechnology.\u201d \u201cI managed to put a stop to that, at least while I was there.\u201d During the same presentation, O\u2019Neill advocated lowering the bar for drug approvals in the US. \u201cWe should reform [the] FDA so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them at their own risk,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s prove efficacy after they\u2019ve been legalized.\u201d",
    "Related StoryAccess to experimental medical treatments is expanding across the USRight to Try laws are being adopted and expanded throughout the country. In one state, they\u2019ll allow healthy people to access unproven treatments.",
    "This sentiment appears to be shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a recent podcast interview with Gary Brecka, who describes himself as a \u201clongevity expert,\u201d Kennedy said that he wanted to expand access to experimental therapies. \u201cIf you want to take an experimental drug \u2026 you ought to be able to do that,\u201d he said in the episode, which was published online in May. But the idea is divisive. O\u2019Neill was essentially suggesting that drugs be made available after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don\u2019t reveal whether the drug actually works. That\u2019s an idea that concerns ethicists. \u201cIt\u2019s just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that\u2019s responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they're made available to patients couldn\u2019t protect patients from charlatans,\u201d says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who is currently on sabbatical. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a complete dereliction of duty.\u201d Robert Steinbrook, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, largely agrees that this kind of change to the drug approval process is a bad idea, though notes that he and his colleagues are generally more concerned about O\u2019Neill\u2019s views on the regulation of technologies like AI in health care, given his previous efforts on algorithms.",
    "\u201cHe has deregulatory views and would not be an advocate for an appropriate amount of regulation when regulation was needed,\u201d Steinbrook says. Ultimately, though, even if O\u2019Neill does try to change things, Zettler points out that there is currently no lawful way for the FDA to approve drugs that aren\u2019t shown to be effective. That requirement won\u2019t change unless Congress acts on the matter, she says: \u201cIt remains to be seen how big of a role HHS leadership will have in FDA policy on that front.\u201d\u00a0 A longevity state A major goal for a subset of longevity enthusiasts relates to another controversial idea: creating new geographic zones in which people can live by their own rules. The goal has taken various forms, including \u201cnetwork states\u201d (which could start out as online social networks and evolve into territories that make use of cryptocurrency), \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d and more recently \u201cfreedom cities.\u201d\u00a0 While specific details vary, the fundamental concept is creating a new society, beyond the limits of nations and governments, as a place to experiment with new approaches to rules and regulations.\u00a0 In 2023, for instance, a group of longevity enthusiasts met at a temporary \u201cpop-up city\u201d in Montenegro to discuss plans to establish a \u201clongevity state\u201d\u2014a geographic zone with a focus on extending human lifespan. Such a zone might encourage healthy behaviors and longevity research, as well as a fast-tracked system to approve promising-looking longevity drugs. They considered Rhode Island as the site but later changed their minds. Related StoryLongevity enthusiasts want to create their own independent state. They\u2019re eyeing Rhode Island.Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro has provided a temporary home for people who plan to set up a new jurisdiction to encourage biohacking and fast-track drugs that slow or reverse aging.",
    "Some of those same longevity enthusiasts have set up shop in Pr\u00f3spera, Honduras\u2014a \u201cspecial economic zone\u201d on the island of Roat\u00e1n with a libertarian approach to governance, where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Another pop-up city, Vitalia, was set up there for two months in 2024, complete with its own biohacking lab; it also happened to be in close proximity to an established clinic selling an unproven longevity \u201cgene therapy\u201d for around $20,000. The people behind Vitalia referred to it as \u201ca Los Alamos for longevity.\u201d Another new project, Infinita City, is now underway in the former Vitalia location. O\u2019Neill has voiced support for this broad concept, too. He\u2019s posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, writing \u201cGet government out of the way\u201d and, in reference to bills to shrink what some politicians see as government overreach, \u201cNo reason to wait.\u201d And more to the point, he wrote on X last November, \u201cBuild freedom cities,\u201d reposting another message that said: \u201cI love the idea and think we should put the first one on the former Alameda Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Bay.\u201d\u00a0 And up until March of last year, according to his financial disclosures, he served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute, an organization with the goal of creating \u201cstartup countries\u201d at sea. \u201cWe are also negotiating with countries to establish a SeaZone (a specially designed economic zone where seasteading companies could build their platforms),\u201d the organization explains on its website.  \u201cThe healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea,\u201d O\u2019Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference in 2009. In that presentation, he talked up the benefits of a free market for health care, saying that seasteads could offer improved health care and serve as medical tourism hubs: \u201cThe last best hope for freedom is on the sea.\u201d Some in the longevity community see the ultimate goal as establishing a network state within the US. \u201cThat\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re doing in Montana,\u201d says A4LI\u2019s Livingston, referring to his successful lobbying efforts to create a hub for experimental medicine there. Over the last couple of years, the state has expanded Right to Try laws, which were originally designed to allow terminally ill individuals to access unproven treatments. Under new state laws, anyone can access such treatments, providing they have been through an initial phase I trial as a preliminary safety test. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a freedom city in Montana without calling it a freedom city,\u201d says Livingston. Patri Friedman, the libertarian founder of the Seasteading Institute, who calls O\u2019Neill \u201ca close friend,\u201d explains that part of the idea of freedom cities is to create \u201cspecific industry clusters\u201d on federal land in the US and win \u201cregulatory carve-outs\u201d that benefit those industries.\u00a0 A freedom city for longevity biotech is \u201cbeing discussed,\u201d says Friedman, although he adds that those discussions are still in the very early stages. He says he\u2019d possibly work with O\u2019Neill on \u201cchanging regulations that are under HHS\u201d but isn\u2019t yet certain what that might involve: \u201cWe're still trying to research and define the whole program and gather support for it.\u201d Will he deliver? Some libertarians, including longevity enthusiasts, believe this is their moment to build a new experimental home.\u00a0 Not only do they expect backing from O\u2019Neill, but they believe President Trump has advocated for new economic zones, perhaps dedicated to the support of specific industries, that can set their own rules for governance.\u00a0 While campaigning for the presidency in 2023, Trump floated what seemed like a similar idea: \u201cWe should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development,\u201d he said in a recorded campaign speech. (The purpose of these new cities was somewhat vague. \u201cThese freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite the American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people\u2014all hardworking families\u2014a new shot at homeownership and in fact the American dream,\u201d he said.)  But given how frequently Trump changes his mind, it\u2019s hard to tell what the president, and others in the administration, will now support on this front.\u00a0 Related StoryTrump\u2019s win is a tragic loss for climate progressHis return to the White House puts the world\u2019s second-largest climate polluter on an emissions trajectory we can\u2019t afford.",
    "And even if HHS does try to create new geographic zones in some form, legal and regulatory experts say this approach won\u2019t necessarily speed up drug development the way some longevity enthusiasts hope.\u00a0 \u201cThe notion around so-called freedom cities, with respect to biomedical innovation, just reflects deep misunderstandings of what drug development entails,\u201d says Ohio State\u2019s Zettler. \u201cIt\u2019s not regulatory requirements that [slow down] drug development\u2014it\u2019s the scientific difficulty of assessing safety and effectiveness and of finding true therapies.\u201d Making matters even murkier, a lot of the research geared toward finding those therapies has been subject to drastic cuts.The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world and has supported major scientific discoveries, including those that benefit longevity research. But in late March, HHS announced a \u201cdramatic restructuring\u201d that would involve laying off 10,000 full-time employees. Since Trump took office, over a thousand NIH research grants have been ended and the administration has announced plans to slash funding for \u201cindirect\u201d research costs\u2014a move that would cost individual research institutions millions of dollars. Research universities (notably Harvard) have been the target of policies to limit or revoke visas for international students, demands to change curricula, and threats to their funding and tax-exempt status. The NIH also directly supports aging research. Notably, the Interventions Testing Program is a program run by the National Institutes of Aging (a branch of the NIH) to find drugs that make mice live longer. The idea is to understand the biology of aging and find candidates for human longevity drugs. The ITP has tested around five to seven drugs a year for over 20 years, says Richard Miller, a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan, one of three institutes involved in the program. \u201cWe\u2019ve published eight winners so far,\u201d he adds. The future of the ITP is uncertain, given recent actions of the Trump administration, he says. The cap on indirect costs alone would cost the University of Michigan around $181 million, the university\u2019s interim vice president for research and innovation said in February. The proposals are subject to ongoing legal battles. But in the meantime, morale is low, says Miller. \u201cIn the worst-case scenario, all aging research [would be stopped],\u201d he says. The A4LI has also had to tailor its lobbying strategy given the current administration\u2019s position on government-funded research. Alongside its efforts to change Montana state law to allow clinics to sell unproven treatments, the organization had been planning to push for an all-new NIH institute dedicated to aging and longevity research\u2014an idea that O\u2019Neill voiced support for last year. But current funding cuts under the new administration suggest that it\u2019s \u201cnot the ideal political climate for this,\u201d says Livingston. Despite their enthusiasm for O\u2019Neill\u2019s confirmation, this has all left many members of the longevity community, particularly those with research backgrounds, concerned about what the cuts mean for the future of longevity science. \u201cSomeone like [O\u2019Neill], who\u2019s an advocate for aging and longevity, would be fantastic to have at HHS,\u201d says Matthew O\u2019Connor, who spent over a decade at SRF and says he knows O\u2019Neill \u201cpretty well.\u201d But he adds that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be cutting the NIH.\u201d Instead, he argues, the agency\u2019s funding should be multiplied by 10. \u201cThe solution to curing diseases isn\u2019t to get rid of the organizations that are there to help us cure diseases,\u201d adds O\u2019Connor, who is currently co-CEO at Cyclarity Therapeutics, a company developing drugs for atherosclerosis and other age-related diseases.\u00a0 But it\u2019s still just too soon to confidently predict how, if at all, O\u2019Neill will shape the government health agencies he will oversee.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s going to be doing as the deputy secretary of HHS,\u201d says Public Citizen\u2019s Steinbrook. \u201cLike everybody who's sworn into a government job, whether we disagree or agree with their views or actions \u2026 we still wish them well. And we hope that they do a good job.\u201d hide"
