The visit was not just symbolic. It was backed by substance

The past few days have marked a significant moment in Sri Lanka’s international diplomacy and its relationship with the Sri Lankan diaspora in Europe. With an invitation extended by the German President, Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Disanayake and Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath undertook a three-day official state visit to Germany that may well be remembered as a turning point in Sri Lanka’s foreign relations. This historic state visit included a series of high-level diplomatic meetings, bilateral agreement signings, and a deeply emotional encounter with Sri Lankans living in Europe. As a participant and moderator of the diaspora meeting held in Berlin, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the remarkable atmosphere of hope, connection, and change that permeated the event.

A new tone in diplomacy

The visit was not just symbolic. It was backed by substance. President Disanayake and Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath met with key figures in the German government, including the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, along with several senior officials and business leaders. Discussions covered a range of topics, from development cooperation and climate initiatives to trade and investment. Several bilateral agreements were signed, laying the groundwork for stronger cooperation in technology, education, sustainable energy, and economic development. Germany, recognised globally for its leadership in environmental technology and sustainable development, signalled through these talks a renewed willingness to support Sri Lanka’s ambitious plans for green energy and economic modernisation.

Sri Lanka’s delegation presented comprehensive strategies aimed at enhancing education standards, fostering innovation, and ensuring inclusive growth that benefits all segments of society. The meetings conveyed a clear message: Sri Lanka is ready to re-engage with the world in a spirit of mutual respect, transparency, and strategic partnership. It was a refreshing departure from the traditional approach to diplomacy, grounded in a vision of inclusive growth and democratic accountability. The fact that the German government initiated and hosted this visit speaks volumes about the growing international confidence in Sri Lanka’s potential and leadership.

The diaspora meeting: A moment of unity

Beyond the state functions, one of the most memorable aspects of the visit was the special meeting between the President and Sri Lankans residing in Europe, particularly those in Germany. Organised by members of the National People’s Power (NPP) in Germany, the event drew nearly 300 attendees, a number that far exceeded expectations. Due to the limited size of the hall, many who wanted to attend could not be accommodated, highlighting the diaspora’s eagerness to reconnect. But those who were present brought with them a wave of emotion, energy, and gratitude. It was clear that this was more than just a political meeting. It was a reunion of trust between a long-disconnected leadership and its people overseas.

As the moderator, I was deeply moved by the emotional expressions from attendees — people shedding tears of hope, applauding each statement with sincerity, and expressing their desire to contribute to Sri Lanka’s transformation. The gathering included a diverse cross-section of the diaspora — students pursuing degrees in Europe, entrepreneurs involved in startups, cultural activists working to preserve Sri Lankan heritage abroad, and families who have made new lives in Germany and beyond.

The event was a vivid reminder that the Sri Lankan diaspora is a powerful force, eager not just to observe but to actively participate in the country’s future. In a time where global politics is often clouded by cynicism, this gathering reminded us of the power of authentic leadership and grassroots connection. It demonstrated that diplomacy is not only conducted in grand government halls but also in heartfelt conversations and shared dreams.

This visit was important for three major reasons:

1.Restoring global confidence in

After years of political instability, economic hardship, and international scepticism, Sri Lanka is beginning to reposition itself as a credible global partner. The German government’s invitation and the substance of the meetings indicate a renewed trust in the island nation’s future. This confidence will be critical as Sri Lanka seeks new trade partners, investment opportunities, and collaborative initiatives in areas like climate resilience and technology.

2.Bridging the gap with the diaspora:

The Sri Lankan diaspora, especially in Europe, has often felt sidelined in national discussions. This meeting re-established that bridge. The President’s presence among the people, his openness to listen, and the crowd’s response marked a new chapter in people-to-people diplomacy. Such engagement is vital because diaspora communities contribute not only remittances but also ideas, skills, and international advocacy. Rebuilding trust is essential to harness this potential fully.

3.Signalling a new political culture:

The visit embodied a shift in tone and intent. The messages repeated by President Dissanayake and his delegation were clear: Say no to corruption. Say no to racism. Say no to radicalism. These are not just slogans—they are principles that can guide a new political era. They promise a government committed to integrity, social cohesion, and moderation — qualities necessary for Sri Lanka’s sustainable peace and development.

What stood out most to me personally was the emotional intensity of the evening. People from all walks of life — students, professionals, families — shared a collective feeling of finally being seen and heard. Some attendees travelled from neighbouring countries to be part of the moment. The pride and joy were palpable. Many took selfies with the President, gifted books and cultural items, and even recited poems. The President’s interactions were not hurried photo-ops; they were sincere conversations filled with empathy and mutual respect. For many in the room, this was their first time engaging with a Sri Lankan leader who represented their values, hopes, and voice.

One young woman shared how this was the first time she felt genuinely represented, after years of feeling disconnected from Sri Lankan politics. An elderly gentleman spoke of hope that the new leadership would finally bring the fairness and accountability the country desperately needs. These personal stories echoed a broader narrative — the diaspora’s desire to be part of a healing, inclusive Sri Lanka. This wasn’t just a political victory; it was a human moment.

As the President departed Germany, he left behind more than just signed agreements and media coverage. He left behind renewed faith. Faith that Sri Lanka can rise again with honest leadership. Faith that the diaspora matters. Faith that change, though difficult, is not impossible. The road ahead is long and complex. Transforming a nation requires more than political will—it demands collective action, inclusive dialogue, and sustained international support. Sri Lanka faces urgent challenges — rebuilding an economy battered by crisis, addressing social divides, and pursuing reconciliation after years of conflict. But this visit has laid a foundation. It has opened new channels for cooperation, trust, and shared vision. Germany’s support in education, renewable energy, and technology transfer can accelerate Sri Lanka’s development trajectory. The diaspora’s renewed engagement can foster cultural exchange and economic ties that benefit both homeland and host countries.

As someone who has studied international diplomacy and teaching International relations and Geopolitics for many years, I can say this without hesitation: this state visit was a diplomatic success. It wasn’t flashy or extravagant, but it was deeply meaningful. It reminded us that diplomacy is not just about protocol and agreements. It’s about building bridges — between nations, between governments and people, and between dreams and reality. From Berlin to Colombo, the message is clear: Sri Lanka is turning a new page. The world is watching, and many of us are ready to walk alongside. Let us move forward with courage, with integrity, and with unity. Say no to corruption. Say no to racism. Say no to radicalism. That is the Sri Lanka we believe in.
