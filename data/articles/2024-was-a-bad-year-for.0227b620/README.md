The year 2024 was a challenging year for sustainability, from climate issues to inequality. Three top concerns include elections and political turmoil that threaten progress, companies retreating or staying silent on DEI and ESG goals, and the rise of sustainability reporting that’s (temporarily) taking up companies’ time. Other issues from the past year include the clean economy hitting tipping points, AI’s growth threatening decarbonization, heavy industry making some progress, and the beginning of a crackdown on “greenwashing.”

This was a rough year for corporate sustainability, especially in the U.S. While there are positive stories and reasons for hope, the path to a just world and healthy planet undeniably got more difficult. In fact, in my more than two decades working in sustainability, this is the first time I’ve seen companies publicly declare a retreat from social goals or climate action.
