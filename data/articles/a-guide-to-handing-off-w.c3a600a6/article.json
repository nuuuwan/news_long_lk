    "When you\u2019re planning for a vacation, it is essential to hand over work efficiently. Begin by notifying colleagues and clients of your absence well in advance, ideally four to six weeks ahead. It is good practice to find a colleague to act as your backup at least a month in advance. Then, create a detailed handover document, listing current project status, pending tasks, and instructions for what they\u2019d need to take care of while you\u2019re away. One week before your departure, review and update this document. This is also a good time to start including\u00a0 your backup in important emails and calendar invites. Next, meet with them one-on-one to clarify expectations or any questions they might have. Lastly, write a clear out-of-office message providing contact details for your backup. Not only will this help in a smooth transition without overwhelming your colleague, but also allow you to enjoy your vacation stress-free.",
