Every May, Tamils commemorate the deaths from the 30-year ethnical conflict between the Tamil Tigers and the Sinhalese-led government. During this event, they often face arrests and harassment from authorities. This year, four Tamils, including three women, were apprehended for distributing bowls of kanji (rice porridge) in remembrance of their dead. While a threat from Ultra Sinhala nationalists threatened a similar event in Colombo, police intervention averted potential disruption.

M.A Sumanthiran of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) criticised the prevailing double standards and hypocrisy, where authorities allow the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to commemorate their attempted revolts, despite the extensive damage caused, yet the Tamil community is prohibited and penalised for commemorating their dead.
