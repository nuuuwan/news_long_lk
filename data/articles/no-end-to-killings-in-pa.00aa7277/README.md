# No end to killings in Palestine despite ‘Peace Agreement’

Yesterday, negotiations led by the US, officially brought the carnage unleashed by Israel on Palestine to an end. The Agreement sees an immediate stop to Israeli aggression in Gaza and the biggest release of Israeli captives since the last temporary truce in the early months of the war.

However in the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the Peace Agreement, the ‘Nation of Change’ a news outlet reported that Israeli airstrikes killed 73 in Gaza just hours after the ceasefire announcement. The number included 20 children. The report added that Netanyahu had assured right-wing ministers that military operations would continue after the initial cease-fire phase to meet broader goals.

This is not surprising. In the past too, while agreements have been agreed upon, Israel has broken them with impunity.

According to the Palestine Health Ministry over 46,707 Palestinians have been killed. In simple language, Israeli attacks killed over 3,113 people per month or over 200 persons on a daily basis. Included in this number are 17,492 children. The attacks have also injured more than 109,660 people. Another 11,160 people remain missing under the rubble.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organisation and the Palestinian government reported as of January 15, that Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed almost all of Gaza’s homes (92%) and 68% of cropland.

Israel has also cut off all potable water supplies, food and medicine to the Gaza. The logic of the Israeli leadership for this mass killing and mayhem is that in October 2023 a Palestinian armed group -Hamas- killed over a thousand Israeli citizens and took hundreds of citizens hostage.

The Palestinian Authority, which is the recognised government of Palestine seems to have been largely sidelined. Mediators gave Israel and Hamas a final draft of the agreement on Monday. A Hamas source told The New Arab on Monday that the deal would be agreed by Tuesday.

The question however is how long the Agreement will lead to sustained peace. Historic patterns show violations and renewed violence following similar deals. The first phase of the plan calls for an immediate cessation of fighting and Israeli troop withdrawal to designated zones, and increased humanitarian aid. This phase also includes the release of 33 Israeli captives and 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Phase two or 42 days after the initial Agreement requires withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza and further prisoner exchanges. The third phase sees reopening of Gaza’s border crossings, large-scale reconstruction efforts, and the exchange of deceased captives’ remains.

However, while the Agreement mandates Israeli troop withdrawal, it allows Israel to monitor Palestinian movement and conduct inspections. It raises the question as to what has changed. Israel remains the occupying power. So what has changed? Analysts remain skeptical about the agreement’s durability. Annelle Sheline, a research fellow at the ‘Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, warned’,” … there have already been signs that Netanyahu has no interest in a lasting ceasefire…”

Again, incoming US President Trump has been on record voicing support for expanded settlements in the West Bank in exchange for backing the ceasefire.

On another track our own country has been persistent in demanding justice to the Cause of Palestine. Despite its left leanings however, our new government has not gone beyond mouthing support for the Palestine cause. We do remember that Ms. Sirimavo Bandaranaike banned travel to Israel until it ceased its illegal occupation of Palestine.

Sadly our present government is mourning over the fact that Israel has ceased recruiting Sri Lankans for agricultural jobs in that country. They have not seen it fit to even condemn, what the United Nations has described as genocide Israel is committing in Palestine.

In our own country, the present regime has not been able to live up to the promises it made pre-election. Despite condemning ex-President Wickremesinghe for accepting the IMF bailout plan, the government has now accepted it too.

Will the present set of rulers who brought so much hope to our electors, now go back on the principles they espoused while in the Opposition regarding the Palestine issue as well?

Come on Mr. President the ball is in your court. Can you walk the talk, or are we witnessing more of the same hypocritical games?
