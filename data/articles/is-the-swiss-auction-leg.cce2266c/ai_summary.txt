Sri Lanka's Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara has announced that following negotiations with the Adani group, the country will buy power from wind plants built by Adani at 8.26 US cents per kWh for 20 years, to be paid in local currency at the prevailing exchange rate. The Indian company plans to invest about $740 million to establish two wind power projects with a combined generation capacity of 484 MW in Sri Lanka. Despite objections to the original plan, the deal is considered a positive development in an environment where Sri Lanka faced high costs per kWh and high demand for power. Sri Lanka has an objective to achieve 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and be carbon-neutral by 2050. The country will have to generate an extra ~7,000 MW of fresh renewable energy, with much needed from private sector sources like Adani Group.
