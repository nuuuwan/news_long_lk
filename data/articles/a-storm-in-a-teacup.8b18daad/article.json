    "Last week was unsettling for me as a marketing and communications professional. The uproar over a beautiful and insightful ad campaign saddened me deeply \u2014 so much so that I felt compelled to speak up, amidst a few differences of opinion from my own fraternity.",
    "To be clear, I have no connection to the company, the brand, or the creative agency behind the ad. I write as a mother, a wife, a marketer, a strategist, a brand builder, and above all, a Sri Lankan who despises bigotry.",
    "The most crucial point is that this is a complete campaign with the broad brand message of \u2018don\u2019t get boxed in\u2019. It is about expanding horizons, celebrating individuality, giving wings to your kids to fly. It seems that most critics have missed this bigger brand idea and the rest of the two ads in the campaign.",
    "Specifically, the controversial Watawala Tea TV commercial depicts a family of four \u2014 parents and two sons with contrasting personalities. One is \u2018sporty\u2019, the other \u2018non-sporty\u2019. The father, portrayed as a typical \u201cmacho\u201d dad, initially struggles to accept his younger son\u2019s non-sportiness. But, through the mother\u2019s empathy and quiet strength, he learns to understand and celebrate his second child, who seems more bent on the softer side of life such as the arts, environment etc.",
    "The message was simple and powerful: Don\u2019t box your children in. Celebrate their individuality. Yet, the ad was met with unwarranted criticism \u2014 accused of promoting an LGBTQ agenda, which it clearly does not.",
    "A post shared with humility from social media",
    "Which part of this controversial ad celebrates or promotes a different sexual orientation? None. Its message is purely about embracing children for who they are \u2014 their personalities, their preferences, their passions. Full stop.",
    "As a mother of two boys \u2014 one \u2018sporty\u2019, one \u2018arty\u2019 \u2014 I could relate to this scenario completely. I once tried to balance their worlds: enrolling the sporty one in art classes and the arty one in sports, thinking that would make them \u201cwell-rounded\u201d individuals who would take on the world. I now know better. Each child is wired differently, and that\u2019s something to be celebrated. Today, one is an engineer and the other an artist \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of both.",
    "I applaud Watawala Tea for taking a bold, socially conscious stand in an environment clouded by hypocrisy and intolerance.",
    "However, a few questions arise:",
    "Was the concept pre-tested, with the brand\u2019s consumer segment, given its boldness for a mass brand?",
    "Due to the social sensitivity of the campaign messaging, was the team mindful and ready with a strategy to manage potential consumer responses?",
    "Were the models and the young actor\u2019s parents fully briefed?",
    "If the child is now facing bullying \u2014 as rumoured \u2014 as a brand, what steps are being taken to protect him?",
    "Most disappointingly, why did the brand bow to pressure and withdraw the ad?",
    "Was the reason for this reaction, mere social media noise?",
    "Is that justifiable from a brand\u2019s perspective?",
    "By pulling the ad, the brand has undermined its own message and credibility. Knee-jerk reactions can hurt more than a misstep. This, truly, is a storm in a teacup.",
    "Questions we must ask",
    "How well do we understand the nuances of different personalities and orientations?",
    "Why do we rush to label and judge?",
    "Can brands in Sri Lanka, like those in India, lead social conversations with courage and sensitivity?",
    "When will mass media shift from political noise to meaningful social discourse?",
    "And when will parents, teachers, and marketers learn to see beyond prejudice?",
    "It\u2019s time brands stood firm for what they believe in \u2014 with bravery, sensitivity, and social responsibility. Because sometimes, a simple cup of tea can hold a mirror to who we really are as a society.",
