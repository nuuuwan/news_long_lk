    "Women\u2019s experiences as parents in the workplace are completely different from men\u2019s. Men get a \u201cfatherhood wage premium,\u201d while mothers encounter a \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d in wages and advancement opportunities. One might think that women without children have workplace advantages on a par with their male counterparts. But they don\u2019t. The maternal wall hinders all women\u2019s careers, whether they plan to have children or not.",
    "Women without children face four biases. First, they face the \u201cmaybe baby\u201d bias, when women ae not hired or promoted due to an assumption that they would become mothers. They also experience a \u201cdo more\u201d bias, where women with no children found that they were expected to work longer and harder than their peers with children. Third, they face a \u201cpay less\u201d bias, where they are seen as less deserving financially because they were \u201cnot working to support a family.\u201d Finally, there is a \u201cnever quite right\u201d bias, where women are perceived as less worthy of positions, promotions, and earnings than their male colleagues, whether women want or have children, or not.",
    "In our book Glass Walls, we tell the story of a newspaper employee whose publisher asked her if she planned to have kids. She replied, \u201cSomeday.\u201d The publisher responded, \u201cThat will be your career.\u201d \u00a0Subsequently, the publisher moved her around the newsroom, never gave her a promotion, and assigned her to the night shift. She quit. While this employee had no children, her employer upended her job due to her aspiration to have children in the future.",
