Acquiring new skills for a radical career change may require setting aside a significant amount of time for self-directed learning, formal training, or even taking on a second job. Accepting the time commitment is the first step, where some sacrifices might have to be made, such as limiting optional activities. Next, understanding the requirements for the new field in terms of education or work experience is key. Additionally, finding time for independent learning by integrating it with daily routines can be beneficial, while having a clear and dedicated time for studying and learning activities is necessary. Modifying your work schedule – starting work earlier or later, working longer hours for fewer days, or reducing to part-time – can also provide extra time for learning.
