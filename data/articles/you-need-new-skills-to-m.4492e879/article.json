    "With any significant change in your career comes the need for new skills. But that\u2019s even more true when you want a radical career change. In these situations, it\u2019s going to take more than listening to a few webinars to build the knowledge you need get to where you...more",
    "Sometimes you don\u2019t just want a new job, you want a radical career change. Perhaps you\u2019ve been in finance and now want to be an acupuncturist, you\u2019re a marketer eager to lead a startup, or you\u2019re an educator looking to shift into catering and event planning.",
    "In these situations, it\u2019s going to take more than listening to a few webinars to build the knowledge or experience you need get to where you want to go. You must set aside a significant amount of time for self-directed learning, formal training, or even a second job to gain the skills for the big leap.",
    "This is not easy, but it is possible.",
    "In my experience as a time management coach, I\u2019ve found these strategies to be the most effective for consistently making time for acquiring brand-new career skills.",
    "Accept the Time Commitment",
    "At the onset, it\u2019s important to recognize that between taking care of your personal life, your main job, and this specific skill-building work, you likely won\u2019t have time for much else. For a major career change to work, you need to be willing to cut back in other areas. That may look like limiting optional items like keeping up on your favorite TV shows, going to happy hours and concerts, and volunteering. And at times, you may need to scale back on essential activities. For example, maybe you can still go for runs, but training for a marathon is out of the picture. Perhaps you can still get an acceptable amount of sleep at night throughout the week, but sleeping in on the weekends is no longer in the cards. Or maybe you make sure to have quality time with your family every day, but need to go to class or work on learning once the kids are in bed.",
    "I don\u2019t recommend that you sacrifice your health or most important relationships to make this change work. But you do need to commit a significant amount of time if you plan to leave your current career.",
    "If you\u2019ve decided you really are serious about making a huge career shift and you\u2019ve set aside the time, you need to then research what\u2019s required for your new field. That could be an education program that sets you up for formal licensing or certification, or it could be more independent learning or side hustle work.",
    "Before you put in a lot of time, make sure you know where that time counts. If you must do a formal program to legally practice in your new profession, put your extra time into the prerequisite courses and applications and then, once you\u2019re accepted, the required coursework. Don\u2019t spend lots of time on self-directed learning where you\u2019re not getting credit for what you\u2019re doing. The opposite is true if a formal program isn\u2019t necessary. You might be significantly delaying your success by going back to school, when you could be taking advantage of other ways to acquire skills and gain experience already at your fingertips.",
    "One of the best ways to find time for independent learning is by layering it onto activities that you\u2019re already doing throughout your day. For example, if you need to listen to course material, do that while walking or driving to work. If you need to read, do it during a commute if you take public transportation or use an app on your phone that will read the text to you while you\u2019re walking or driving. (Using voice reading apps, such as Talk and Text to Speech!, is the primary way that I get through long pdfs.)",
    "If you tend to revert to reading or watching things on your phone during downtimes, like when you\u2019re waiting at a doctor\u2019s office or during a child\u2019s soccer practice, use that time to work through your learning material instead. Every little bit counts.",
    "Finding slices of time already in your workday will help you get a lot done. But if you have a great deal of material to get through \u2014 or mandated coursework you need to complete \u2014 you\u2019ll also need to designate time to immerse yourself in the learning.",
    "A formal education program can be helpful for this if they have live class times when you\u2019re expected to show up or attend virtually. This helps to force the issue and make your learning consistent. One of my coaching clients, who is doing an MBA in addition to working a full-time job, goes to class on Wednesday night, attends the office hours on the weekend, and uses two hours before and one hour after those office hours to get all the homework done. This ensures she\u2019s consistently investing time in her learning at a designated time each week. If you take on a second job to learn new skills where they require you to work certain hours \u2014 for instance, 5-9 pm on a Tuesday and 9 am to 2 pm on a Saturday \u2014 that can also help make it a lot easier to be consistent with your skills development.",
    "For self-paced work, you\u2019ll need to clarify the time to get things done for yourself. Usually, I\u2019ve seen my clients pick one or two nights a week where they spend between 90 minutes to two hours dedicated to learning from about 7 pm to 9 pm. Then they usually have a longer studying time on the weekends of three to four hours. Some people may try to fit in learning on their lunch hour, but I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s hard for most people to be consistent at that time unless it\u2019s something relatively small like commenting on classmates\u2019 posts. Depending on the commitments you already have at work and in your personal life, you should find a time that works for you. Just make sure it\u2019s consistent so it becomes routine.",
    "It\u2019s extremely important from both a practical and emotional standpoint that you\u2019re clear on when you\u2019re focused on your learning and when you\u2019re not. Practically, it helps you to avoid making other plans, working late, or simply forgetting to focus on learning. Emotionally, it helps with not having the constant nagging feeling that you should be doing personal development but never quite knowing when to engage and when to simply relax.",
    "Modify Your Work Schedule",
    "Depending on the rigor of your skill-building needs, you may have to modify your work schedule to make everything work. Start by reviewing your organization\u2019s policies on work times. Then think through what would most support your outside development, such as adjusting your hours: You could come in earlier so you could leave earlier and have time for learning or your side hustle, or you could come in later and leave later in order to work on your development in the mornings. Alternatively, and if your company allows it, you could switch to working four, 10-hour days so that you have your fifth day free for education or a second job. Once you\u2019ve decided what you think would work best, have a discussion with your manager about whether or not the changes would be possible in your particular situation or role.",
    "Finally, if you just really don\u2019t feel like you can fit it all in, consider reducing your \u201cday job\u201d down to part time \u2014 75% or 80% of your full-time role \u2014 if you can. With those additional hours, you can focus on what it takes to get to your next career step.",
    "Gaining a brand-new set of skills for a new career takes time, effort, dedication, and focus. But if you really want the change and you use the right strategies, you have what it takes to make it happen, even in your already busy schedule.",
