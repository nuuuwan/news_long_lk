# G7 affirms Western support for Ukraine, for now

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- The G7 leaders agreed on June 14th in Italy to give an extra $50bn by the end of 2024 to aid Ukraine‚Äôs war effort.
- This loan will be serviced and repaid through earnings from roughly $300bn of Russian sovereign assets frozen since the start of the war and primarily held in the EU.
- This decision compares to the combined contributions of the EU and the US since the start of the war till the end of April, which are ‚Ç¨102bn ($111bn) and ‚Ç¨74bn respectively, called by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
- Additional funds will support Ukraine's energy infrastructure repairs and ongoing military needs.
- The latest G7 communiqu√© showed greater coherence on China policy, with China featuring more prominently than in last year's summit due to its "support for Russia's defence industrial base."
- The syndicate loan will cover military, budget, reconstruction, and humanitarian support, and Japan will also participate despite its constitutional restrictions against funding foreign military expenditures.

Opinions:
- The G7's additional support for Ukraine is unlikely to give the latter an upper hand in the conflict.
- The expansion of Western support for Ukraine in the future will be politically challenging.
- It is predicted that US President Joe Biden will secure his re-election in November, but his administration's stance will still be swayed by calls from Donald Trump to reduce support for Ukraine.
- Overall, the most likely future scenario for the Ukraine war is a gradual freeze due to exhaustion on both sides.
- Germany and Japan within the G7 grouping have been more reluctant than others to adopt hawkish positions towards China due to their deeper trade ties with the country.
- Greater cohesion within the G7 on Ukraine and China issues contrasts with growing divisions within the G20, and the consensus in the G7 could be disrupted if Donald Trump wins the US presidential election.

G7 affirms Western support for Ukraine, for now

The communiqu√© adopted on June 14th at a G7 leaders‚Äô meeting in Italy outlined shared positions on challenges relating to global conflict, development, climate and migration. An agreement to provide an extra US$50bn by end-2024 to fund Ukraine‚Äôs war effort was the most significant announcement and followed extensive efforts by the US to secure backing from other G7 members. The syndicate loan will be serviced and repaid through investment earnings on the near-US$300bn of Russian sovereign assets frozen since the beginning of the war that are primarily held in the EU.

The summit was a reaffirmation of Western support for Ukraine.¬†The loan will be directed to military and development needs, and is substantial: it compares with allocations by Europe and the US from the beginning of the war to end-April of ‚Ç¨102bn (US$111bn) and ‚Ç¨74bn respectively, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The agreement comes alongside the provision of fresh US military aid to Ukraine, an expansion of US sanctions on Russia‚Äôs financial infrastructure as well as secondary sanctions, and the signing of a ten-year US-Ukraine security agreement at the summit. The additional funds will support Ukraine‚Äôs repair of energy infrastructure and ongoing military requirements, but it will not be enough to give Ukraine the upper hand in the conflict.

Future expansion in Western support for Ukraine will be politically difficult.¬†Proposals such as the outright confiscation of Russian sovereign assets or the inclusion of Ukraine within NATO are unlikely to advance, absent major developments on the battlefield. We expect the US president, Joe Biden, to secure re-election in November, but his administration will still be influenced by calls from his rival, Donald Trump,¬†to scale back support for Ukraine. A victory by Mr Trump would imperil further aid. The EU‚Äôs approach is also subject to political risk given that its sanctions on frozen assets require their unanimous support for renewal every six months. Although support for Ukraine within the EU is firm, the sanctions imposed on Russian assets require renewal every six months. The most likely scenario for the war remains a gradual freezing of the conflict amid general exhaustion on either side.

The communiqu√© showed closer G7 co-ordination on China policy.¬†The country featured more prominently than in last year‚Äôs summit, with new language that linked its¬†industrial policies¬†with ‚Äúharmful overcapacity‚Äù and expressed concern about its ‚Äúsupport for Russia‚Äôs defence industrial base‚Äù. There are now more points of commonality than differences between G7 members in terms of trade and security policies towards China. Of the grouping, Germany and, to a slightly lesser extent, Japan remain more reluctant than others to adopt hawkish positions, owing to their deeper trade relationships with China.

Funds through the syndicate loan will arrive by the end of this year, with some flowing beyond that, depending on Ukraine‚Äôs ability to absorb and disburse the money. The funds will cover military, budget, reconstruction and humanitarian support. That will allow Japan, which cannot constitutionally fund military expenditures abroad, to participate.

More broadly, the G7 summit continues to draw purpose from the need to co-ordinate on Ukraine‚Äôs defence. Differences over other policy issues, such as approach to China, have also narrowed. This greater cohesion contrasts with widening divisions within the G20, whose leaders are due to meet in Brazil in November; however, consensus within the G7 will almost certainly be upset if Mr Trump wins the US presidential election.
