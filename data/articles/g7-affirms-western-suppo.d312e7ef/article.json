    "The communiqu\u00e9 adopted on June 14th at a G7 leaders\u2019 meeting in Italy outlined shared positions on challenges relating to global conflict, development, climate and migration. An agreement to provide an extra US$50bn by end-2024 to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort was the most significant announcement and followed extensive efforts by the US to secure backing from other G7 members. The syndicate loan will be serviced and repaid through investment earnings on the near-US$300bn of Russian sovereign assets frozen since the beginning of the war that are primarily held in the EU.",
    "The summit was a reaffirmation of Western support for Ukraine.\u00a0The loan will be directed to military and development needs, and is substantial: it compares with allocations by Europe and the US from the beginning of the war to end-April of \u20ac102bn (US$111bn) and \u20ac74bn respectively, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The agreement comes alongside the provision of fresh US military aid to Ukraine, an expansion of US sanctions on Russia\u2019s financial infrastructure as well as secondary sanctions, and the signing of a ten-year US-Ukraine security agreement at the summit. The additional funds will support Ukraine\u2019s repair of energy infrastructure and ongoing military requirements, but it will not be enough to give Ukraine the upper hand in the conflict.",
    "Future expansion in Western support for Ukraine will be politically difficult.\u00a0Proposals such as the outright confiscation of Russian sovereign assets or the inclusion of Ukraine within NATO are unlikely to advance, absent major developments on the battlefield. We expect the US president, Joe Biden, to secure re-election in November, but his administration will still be influenced by calls from his rival, Donald Trump,\u00a0to scale back support for Ukraine. A victory by Mr Trump would imperil further aid. The EU\u2019s approach is also subject to political risk given that its sanctions on frozen assets require their unanimous support for renewal every six months. Although support for Ukraine within the EU is firm, the sanctions imposed on Russian assets require renewal every six months. The most likely scenario for the war remains a gradual freezing of the conflict amid general exhaustion on either side.",
    "The communiqu\u00e9 showed closer G7 co-ordination on China policy.\u00a0The country featured more prominently than in last year\u2019s summit, with new language that linked its\u00a0industrial policies\u00a0with \u201charmful overcapacity\u201d and expressed concern about its \u201csupport for Russia\u2019s defence industrial base\u201d. There are now more points of commonality than differences between G7 members in terms of trade and security policies towards China. Of the grouping, Germany and, to a slightly lesser extent, Japan remain more reluctant than others to adopt hawkish positions, owing to their deeper trade relationships with China.",
    "Funds through the syndicate loan will arrive by the end of this year, with some flowing beyond that, depending on Ukraine\u2019s ability to absorb and disburse the money. The funds will cover military, budget, reconstruction and humanitarian support. That will allow Japan, which cannot constitutionally fund military expenditures abroad, to participate.",
    "More broadly, the G7 summit continues to draw purpose from the need to co-ordinate on Ukraine\u2019s defence. Differences over other policy issues, such as approach to China, have also narrowed. This greater cohesion contrasts with widening divisions within the G20, whose leaders are due to meet in Brazil in November; however, consensus within the G7 will almost certainly be upset if Mr Trump wins the US presidential election.",
