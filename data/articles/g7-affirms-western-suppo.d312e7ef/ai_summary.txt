Facts:
- The G7 leaders agreed on June 14th in Italy to give an extra $50bn by the end of 2024 to aid Ukraine’s war effort.
- This loan will be serviced and repaid through earnings from roughly $300bn of Russian sovereign assets frozen since the start of the war and primarily held in the EU.
- This decision compares to the combined contributions of the EU and the US since the start of the war till the end of April, which are €102bn ($111bn) and €74bn respectively, called by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
- Additional funds will support Ukraine's energy infrastructure repairs and ongoing military needs.
- The latest G7 communiqué showed greater coherence on China policy, with China featuring more prominently than in last year's summit due to its "support for Russia's defence industrial base."
- The syndicate loan will cover military, budget, reconstruction, and humanitarian support, and Japan will also participate despite its constitutional restrictions against funding foreign military expenditures.

Opinions:
- The G7's additional support for Ukraine is unlikely to give the latter an upper hand in the conflict.
- The expansion of Western support for Ukraine in the future will be politically challenging.
- It is predicted that US President Joe Biden will secure his re-election in November, but his administration's stance will still be swayed by calls from Donald Trump to reduce support for Ukraine.
- Overall, the most likely future scenario for the Ukraine war is a gradual freeze due to exhaustion on both sides.
- Germany and Japan within the G7 grouping have been more reluctant than others to adopt hawkish positions towards China due to their deeper trade ties with the country.
- Greater cohesion within the G7 on Ukraine and China issues contrasts with growing divisions within the G20, and the consensus in the G7 could be disrupted if Donald Trump wins the US presidential election.
