Tech companies are under scrutiny due to their contracts with militaries worldwide amid the Israeli assault on Gaza. William Fitzgerald, a former Google public policy and corporate communications worker, used his own experience in the 2017 #CancelMaven campaign to call for tech workers to investigate their employers' contributions to these military contracts. Fitzgerald was instrumental in Google cancelling its participation in Project Maven, a Department of Defense contract for AI-assisted military drones. The No Tech for Apartheid coalition aims to cancel Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract for Google and Amazon to provide Israeli government and defence infrastructure with AI and cloud computing capabilities. Google fired 50 workers allegedly involved in protesting Project Nimbus, revealing a shift in the company's management from 2017's defensiveness. Concerns about the implications of AI weaponry's proliferation and calls for a sufficient backlash against military contracts from the tech sector are increasing.
