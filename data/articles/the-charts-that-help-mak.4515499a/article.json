    "What Is Everyone Actually Doing with Gen AI?",
    "2024 was the year of gen AI \u2026 again. But, for all the hype over the past two years, do we really know what people actually using this tech for? Projections about how LLMs might change everything are one thing, but seeing real use cases is another.",
    "To answer this question, Marc Zao-Sanders, the author of \u201cHow People Are Really Using Gen AI,\u201d and his team analyzed tens of thousands of posts on online forums such as Reddit and Quara, and sifted through the noise to find out what people were sharing about their own experiences of using gen AI at work.",
    "The use of this technology is as wide-ranging as the problems we encounter in our lives. We divided the 100 categories we identified into six top-level themes, which give an immediate sense of what generative AI is being used for: content creation and editing (23%), technical assistance and troubleshooting (21%), personal and professional support (17%), learning and education (16%), creativity and recreation (13%), and research, analysis, and decision-daking (10%).",
    "This article \u2014 and the chart illustrating its findings \u2014 aren\u2019t so much a blueprint for how companies can bring this tech on board, but rather a snapshot of how ordinary people have been able to make it useful in their own lives.",

    "How Economies Respond to Populist Leaders",
    "Across the world, the elections of 2024 echoed a common trend: incumbents struggled and challengers that flew a populist banner \u2014 often paired with an argument that they can fix economies that aren\u2019t working \u2014 secured more power. This has put businesses in an odd spot. \u201cWhile companies generally revile populists of the left, when it comes to those who claim to be pro-business, their feelings are often conflicted,\u201d write Roberto Stefan Foa and Rachel Kleinfeld, authors of \u201cWhen Populists Rise, Economies Usually Fall.\u201d \u201cWhether it is Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, or Italy\u2019s Silvio Berlusconi, such figures at first come across as \u2018can-do\u2019 problem-solvers who are, at least, capable of getting things done \u2026 Populists play on this perception, presenting themselves as prospective \u2018CEOs-in-chief.\u2019\u201d",
    "As the headline suggests, their research found that \u2014 more often than not \u2014 populist leaders on both the left and right have failed to deliver on their economic promises. Stock markets tend to trend down, and inflation trends up. Why? Put simply, \u201cthinking of populists as left or right is a misunderstanding. Populists care little about ideology \u2014 what they want is power.\u201d",
    "They highlight a number of risks business leaders should consider in such an environment, including around credit and currency stability, talent hiring and retention across political divides, and the impact that the weakening of normal policy-making procedures and the rule of law might have on investor confidence and asset flows.",

    "The Long Tail of Layoffs",
    "Despite the U.S. economy appearing to stick a soft landing after a protracted fight against inflation, 2024 was another year of big layoffs at major companies. Whether driven by economic trends or changing priorities \u2014 tech companies, for instance, have shifted resources to match their increasing focus on AI \u2014 layoffs are a common answer to business woes.",
    "According to Didier Elzinga and Amy Lavoie, the authors of \u201cThe Long-Term Costs of Layoffs,\u201d\u00a0leaders are probably underestimating the consequences of these dramatic reductions in headcount. They write:",
    "Layoffs might sound like a shortcut to a more agile, lean, and responsive operation, but proceed with caution. While they can lead to short-term financial benefits \u2014 and even rightsize burn to ensure the continued economic stability of a company in uncertain economic times \u2014 our research shows just how much of an impact they can have on employee engagement, morale, and loyalty, and how long that negative impact can last.",
    "Looking at data from 146 companies, they measured employee sentiment, using metrics such as pride, motivation, and commitment. They found that some aspects of engagement were still depressed two years after layoffs among employees who worked at companies during a downsizing. At companies with high engagement pre-layoffs, the detrimental effects of layoffs were generally more pronounced, not less.",

    "Globally, one in five workers reports feeling lonely, according to Gallup\u2019s 2024 State of the Global Workplace report. There are easy scapegoats for this problem: remote work, the isolating nature of particular jobs, or personal characteristics that predispose people towards loneliness. But the authors of \u201cWe\u2019re Still Lonely at Work,\u201d Constance Noonan Hadley and Sarah L. Wright, argue that these are just convenient myths. Having studied 1,000 U.S. knowledge workers across 20 companies, they argue that in-person work and assigning people to teams won\u2019t fix the problem, and that blaming people for being needy or otherwise deficient simply deflects from what companies can \u2014 and should \u2014 do.",
    "Before loneliness can be addressed,\u00a0it needs to be understood. As a first step, they suggest this tool for measuring how (dis)connected people feel. \u201cWe have yet to meet a manager who systematically assesses work loneliness using a research-verified instrument,\u201d the write. \u201cGiven the social stigma and shame that surround loneliness, it is important to administer such surveys in a way that protects employee privacy \u2014 for example, by conducting the survey anonymously, which also increases the chances of gathering accurate data.\u201d",
    "From there, companies and managers can take steps to cultivate social bonds: building enough slack into workflows for people to connect, building socializing into the rhythm of work, and so on.",

    "What It Will Take to Get to Net Zero",
    "Companies are often asked what they\u2019re doing to decarbonize their operations. Do they have a plan to get to net zero? How are they working toward that goal? And as world governments continually struggle to reach accord on how they are going to facilitate this transition, the question of how to approach this existential threat often falls to individual companies to sort out for themselves.",
    "\u201cWhat is often missing from this conversation is a recognition of the difficulty in transforming the complex physical assets underlying our current energy system \u2014 a system that has been optimized over more than a century to deliver high performance, that is deeply embedded in the global economy, and that serves billions of people,\u201d write Mekala Krishnan, Chris Bradley, Humayun Tai and Tiago Devesa, the authors of \u201c25 Tech and Infrastructure Problems to Solve Before We Can Reach Net Zero.\u201d",
    "So, they created a graphic to do just that: visualize the technology and infrastructure challenges that need to be met to get to net zero. They\u2019ve mapped these across industries, categories, and how difficult they will be to address. It reveals the complexity hidden in the deceptively simple question \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan to get to net zero?\u201d \u2014 and shows just how much work there is to be done to answer it.",

    "As Goes Beer, So Goes the Nation",
    "One of the major shifts of the past year is how attitudes around corporate activism have changed. DEI and ESG policies have been the targets of intense backlash, and many companies that embraced more activist stances after 2020 seem to be reconsidering whether anything that could be perceived as political should be part of their brand. In retrospect, the Bud Light boycott of 2023 \u2014 sparked by a social media collaboration with Dylan Mulvaney, an influencer who is trans \u2014 can seem like a turning point that foreshadowed what was to come.",
    "In \u201cLessons from the Bud Light Boycott, One Year Later,\u201d researchers Jura Liaukonyte, Anna Tuchman, and Xinrong Zhu asked: \u201cWhy has Bud Light endured more sustained sales decreases than other brands that have been the target of recent boycotts?\u201d To answer this question, they graphed how sales data for major beer brands correlated with voting data. In Bud Light\u2019s case, part of the answer for the boycott\u2019s impact on its sales had to do with where it landed on a polarization index: just a hair to the right of center.",
    "\u201cOverall, brands near the middle of the spectrum may be in an especially vulnerable position because taking a stance on any polarizing issue could potentially alienate a large chunk of their customer base,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIn contrast, brands near the ends of the spectrum can more safely take positions that align with their customers\u2019 views, without the risk of angering many existing customers.\u201d",

    "As we\u2019ve all learned again and again over the past few years, predicting the future is \u2026 hard. But, while betting on the unforeseeable may be a fool\u2019s errand, thinking through what might come can help us prepare for the myriad of possibilities. In that spirit, we\u2019ll end this article looking ahead.",
    "Earlier this year, researchers Nicky Dries, Joost Luyckx, and Philip Rogiers asked 570 experts to predict what the future of work will look like. The experts were an intentionally eclectic mix, \u201cfrom tech, economics, and writing/journalism, from both our personal networks and from larger mailing lists for Belgian CEOs and journalists\u201d \u2014 and were classified as either optimists, skeptics, or pessimists. The authors asked these experts to weigh in on common predictions about the future and when they might come to pass.",
    "As you might expect, there was significant disagreement. \u201c[A]ll three groups of experts were truly convinced that their predictions about the future of work were right and that the others were wrong \u2014 and even preposterous,\u201d the authors report. Even so, they averaged the predictions to create a rough \u201cconsensus\u201d view of what the future may hold. Taken as a whole, it\u2019s a bit jarring: there\u2019s a lot of things to worry about on the horizon, and some of it may not be very far off.",

    "That said, nothing is a foregone conclusion. The authors explain that they engaged in this thought experiment precisely because there are so many significant decisions to be made now that will dictate what tomorrow may bring. \u201cBased on our research, we would like to invite every citizen, every policy maker, and every manager and CEO to enter the public debate around the future of work to ensure that it unfolds within a social and democratic dialogue,\u201d they write. \u201cThe future is what we make it.\u201d",
