    "The last bastion of independent Buddhism, became a haven for the Muslims in their hour of distress",
    "Being traders, Muslims also had access to the Ports,\u00a0 links with the outside and therefore were knowledgeable on matters of\u00a0 the world",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s history of peaceful relations that had existed\u00a0 between the Sinhalese and the Muslims, stands as a contrast against the\u00a0 mass destruction taking place in the Middle East in the name of\u00a0 ethnicity and religion.",
    "The late, eminent historian Dr. Lorna Dewaraja,\u00a0 whose insights of the close bonds that had existed between the two\u00a0 ethnic groups in Sri Lanka puts to shame the ongoing fighting states in\u00a0 her book \u2018The Muslims of Sri Lanka, Thousand Years of Ethnic Harmony 900-1915\u2019 that\u00a0 \u201cexcept for a riot that took place in 1915, caused by political and\u00a0 economic tension rather than a confrontation between Islam and\u00a0 Buddhism,\u201d the harmonious relationship that developed between the\u00a0 indigenous inhabitants and the Muslims, continued uninterrupted and they\u00a0 lived together peacefully for over a thousand years.",
    "A Vijitha Yapa Publication, last printed in 2021, the author, encouraged by Sri Lanka\u2019s first Foreign Minister, A.C.S. Hameed,\u00a0 had dug deep into the roots of Muslims and makes the disclosure that\u00a0 the Muslim community never showed political ambitions of making\u00a0 conquests in Sri Lanka. This was \u201cunlike in India, where Islam made its\u00a0 entry as a conquering, proselytizing force.\u201d",
    "Circumstances did draw them into the political whirlpool and the author speaking of the roles played by the Muslims in\u00a0 the island\u2019s political history, discusses the magnanimity of Sri Lankan\u00a0 Kings who gave them the freedom to pursue their faith and trade which\u00a0 enabled them to be absorbed into Lankan society.",
    "The Muslims, enjoyed a monopoly in the jewellery, pearls,\u00a0 gems and spice trade until the unexpected arrival of the Portuguese in\u00a0 the island in 1505 that dealt a death blow to the peaceful exchange of\u00a0 commodities with the Sinhalese. This however, led them ultimately to\u00a0 participate in Lankan politics.",
    "Muslims and King\u00a0of Kotte",
    "\u201cEven at the time of Portuguese landing,\u201d she states \u201ca\u00a0 number of Muslim ships had been anchored in the Colombo harbour. Sensing\u00a0 trouble on finding that the Portuguese were erecting a fort, the\u00a0 Muslims had warned the King of Kotte \u2013 Parakramabahu 1X (CE 1489-1513)\u00a0 of the potential threat.\u201d",
    "The King\u2019s attempts however, to oust the intruders with the help of the Muslims and the Malabars, had met with little success.",
    "The Sinhalese, had always been essentially farmers. With\u00a0 caste prejudices, they were preoccupied with the cultivation of paddy\u00a0 lands while the Muslims as traders, did not come in the way of their\u00a0 occupation.",
    "Problems commenced when the Portuguese who arrived in the\u00a0 island, discovered that the snag in achieving a monopoly of the\u00a0 profitable cinnamon trade was the presence of Muslims. This led to cause\u00a0 the rift between the Muslims and the Europeans.",
    "The \u201cVijayaba Kollaya\u201d of 1521 \u2013 a turning point in Lankan\u00a0 history, directly impacted on the trek of the Muslims from the coastal\u00a0 belt to the interior of the island. The Portuguese, who befriended\u00a0 Bhuvanekabahu V11 (CE1521-1551,) the new King of Kotte, persuaded him to\u00a0 expel the Moors from Colombo. Bhuvanekabahu, being afraid of his\u00a0 ambitious brother \u2013 Mayadunna (CE1521-1581,) the new King of Sitavaka\u00a0 and badly in need of assistance of the Portuguese, complied. The Moors\u00a0 as a result, taking refuge in the Sitavaka Kingdom, rallied round\u00a0 Mayadunne, now confirmed as a nationalist leader. And to fight the\u00a0 Portuguese, they brought the forces of the Zamorin of Calicut which\u00a0 intensified the Portugese hatred of the Moors. And the bitter rivalry\u00a0 between the Christian power and the Muslims that prevailed in Europe,\u00a0 was vigorously pursued on the island.",
    "Although Mayaduue and his son Rajasinghe 1 (CE1581-1592)\u00a0 carried on relentless warfare with the Portuguese, the political\u00a0 developments that followed sent Muslims further into the interior.\u00a0 Bhuvanekabahu\u2019s successor Dharmapala (CE1551-1597) bequeathed Kotte\u00a0 Kingdom to the King of Portugal. And with the death of Rajasinghe 1, the\u00a0 son of Mayadunne, Sitawaka was annexed to the Portuguese territory.",
    "Having acquired the Kotte and Sitavaka kingdoms and with\u00a0 only Vimaladharmasuriya 1 (CE 1592-1604) the King of Kandy to deal with,\u00a0 the Portugese expelled the Moors from Sitawaka. They had also settled\u00a0 down in the port towns of Negombo, Puttalam, Beruwela and Alutgama.",
    "The attempted extermination of the Muslims by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch, commenced their infiltration to the Kandyan\u00a0 Kingdom from the Western Province where awaited a hearty welcome by the\u00a0 upcountry rulers especially that of King Senarat (CE 1604-1635.) Thus,\u00a0 the last bastion of independent Buddhism, became a haven for the Muslims\u00a0 in their hour of distress where they were allowed to practice their\u00a0 religion without hindrance from the Portugese. This commenced the\u00a0 indigenisation of the Muslims.",
    "The Kandyan kingdom in turn, being denuded of manpower\u00a0 following the continuous wars, needed people to develop agriculture and\u00a0 strengthen the economy. Being traders, Muslims also had access to the\u00a0 Ports, links with the outside and therefore were knowledgeable on\u00a0 matters of the world. Muslim villages thus sprang along trade routes to\u00a0 Kandy and in the interior where Kings had given them grants of land.",
    "Having encouraged the Muslims to maintain their links with\u00a0 the Islamic world, the King found them useful informants of\u00a0 international affairs. A state of harmonious co-existence as a result,\u00a0 unique in an era of religious persecution and rivalry, developed in Sri\u00a0 Lanka.",
    "Arab authors have recorded that the Royal court of Sri\u00a0 Lanka was particularly noted for its religious tolerance. Idrisi in the\u00a0 12th century had mentioned of a Council of 16 set up at the Royal Court\u00a0 consisting of 4 Buddhists, 4 Muslims, 4 Christians and 4 Jews. The\u00a0 interests of the rulers were closely integrated with those of the\u00a0 Muslims and hence the latter\u2019s advice was readily accepted. It is also\u00a0 possible, the author suggests, that the trade missions sent to the Arab\u00a0 world by the King was a cover to seek an alliance with the Muslim world\u00a0 to counter the constant threat of invasions from South India.",
    "Dr. Dewaraja makes the point that the Muslims on their\u00a0 part, while rendering service, never attempted to arrogate political\u00a0 power on themselves. They were respectful of state authority and were\u00a0 sensitive to the susceptibilities of the Sinhalese. Hence, although they\u00a0 arrived as refugees, they were well received at the Kandyan Court. Queros\u00a0 writing of Senarath\u2019s action said \u201cin Batticaloa, the idolatrous king,\u00a0 placed a garrison of four thousand of them, thus showing his mind by\u00a0 favouring our enemy.\u201d",
    "Senarath\u2019s settling of the Muslims in the fertile lands\u00a0 around Batticaloa, resulted in the quick recovery of the kingdom\u00a0 following the invasions of 1628 and 1630. The largest rural Muslim\u00a0 settlements to this day are in the Batticaloa area and they have earned\u00a0 the reputation of being some of the best farmers in the country.",
    "Particularly adroit at diplomacy, the King in turn,\u00a0 depended on their services with regard to information of foreign\u00a0 visitors who arrived at the Trincomalee port. With their linguistic\u00a0 fluency \u2013 being able to speak Tamil, some South Indian languages and\u00a0 even Portugese, they kept the King well informed of trade and power\u00a0 politics operating globally while acting as virtual ambassadors. The\u00a0 author\u2019s findings during her research include a few Muslim families in\u00a0 the Kandyan areas bearing the family name of \u201cTanapathilage gedera\u201d\u00a0 (home of the ambassador.)"
