    "This week, I\u2019ve been thinking about the powerful connection between mind and body. Some new research suggests that people with heart conditions have better outcomes when they are more hopeful and optimistic. Hopelessness, on the other hand, is associated with a significantly higher risk of death. The findings build upon decades of fascinating research into the phenomenon of the placebo effect. Our beliefs and expectations about a medicine (or a sham treatment) can change the way it works. The placebo effect\u2019s \u201cevil twin,\u201d the nocebo effect, is just as powerful\u2014negative thinking has been linked to real symptoms.

In one state, they\u2019ll allow healthy people to access unproven treatments.",
    "Researchers are still trying to understand the connection between body and mind, and how our thoughts can influence our physiology. In the meantime, many are developing ways to harness it in hospital settings. Is it possible for a doctor to prescribe hope? Alexander Montasem, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, is trying to find an answer to that question. In his latest study, Montasem and his colleagues focused on people with cardiovascular disease.",
    "The team reviewed all published research into the link between hope and heart health outcomes in such individuals. Hope is a pretty tricky thing to nail down, but these studies use questionnaires to try to do that. In\u00a0one popular questionnaire, hope is defined as \u201ca positive motivational state\u201d based on having agency and plans to meet personal goals. Montasem\u2019s team found 12 studies that fit the bill. All told, these studies included over 5,000 people. And together, they found that high hopefulness was associated with better health outcomes: less angina, less post-stroke fatigue, a higher quality of life, and a lower risk of death. The team presented its work at\u00a0the British Cardiovascular Society meeting in Manchester earlier this week.",
    "When I read the results, it immediately got me thinking about the placebo effect. A placebo is a \u201csham\u201d treatment\u2014an inert substance like a sugar pill or saline injection that does not contain any medicine. And yet hundreds of studies have shown that such treatments can have remarkable effects. They can ease the symptoms of pain, migraine, Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression, anxiety, and a host of other disorders. The way a placebo is delivered can influence its effectiveness, and so can its color, shape, and price.\u00a0Expensive placebos seem to be more effective. And placebos\u00a0can even work when people know they are just placebos. And then there\u2019s the nocebo effect. If you expect to feel worse after taking something, you are much more likely to. The nocebo effect can\u00a0increase the risk of pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, and more.\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryThe pain is real. The painkillers are virtual reality.Immersing patients in virtual worlds can reduce the pain of a needle stick as well as more pernicious chronic pain.",
    "It\u2019s obvious our thoughts and beliefs can play an enormous role in our health and well-being. What\u2019s less clear is exactly how it happens. Scientists have made some progress\u2014there\u2019s evidence that\u00a0a range of brain chemicals, including the body\u2019s own opioids, are involved in both the placebo and nocebo effects. But the exact mechanisms remain something of a mystery. In the meantime, researchers are working on ways to harness the power of positive thinking. There have been long-running debates over\u00a0whether it is ever ethical for a doctor to deceive patients to make them feel better. But I\u2019m firmly of the belief that doctors have a duty to be honest with their patients. A more ethical approach might be to find ways to build patients\u2019 hope, says Montasem. Not by exaggerating the likely benefit of a drug or by sugar-coating a prognosis, but perhaps by helping them work on their goals, agency, and general outlook on life. Some early research suggests that this approach can help. Laurie McLouth at the University of Kentucky and her colleagues found that a series of discussions about values, goals, and strategies to achieve those goals\u00a0improved hope among people being treated for advanced lung cancer. Montasem now plans to review all the published work in this area and design a new approach to increasing hope. Any approach might have to be tailored to an individual, he adds. Some people might be more responsive to a more spiritual or religious way of thinking about their lives, for example.",
    "These approaches could also be helpful for all of us, even outside clinical settings. I asked Montasem if he had any advice for people who want to have a positive outlook on life more generally. He told me that it\u2019s important to have personal goals, along with a plan to achieve them. His own goals center on advancing his research, helping patients, and spending time with his family. \u201cMaterialistic goals aren\u2019t as beneficial for your wellbeing,\u201d he adds. Since we spoke, I\u2019ve been thinking over my own goals. I\u2019ve realized that my first is to come up with a list of goals. And I plan to do it soon. \u201cThe minute we give up [on pursuing] our goals, we start falling into hopelessness,\u201d he says.
