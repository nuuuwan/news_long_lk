Fifteen years after the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, Tamils in the island nation continue to struggle with poverty, enforced disappearances, and growing marginalisation. Economic setbacks stemming from Sri Lanka’s 2022 economic crisis and lack of job creation have led many to consider migrating, often taking significant financial risks. On top of mounting economic challenges, the issue of land has emerged as a major flashpoint, with locals protesting the state's land grabs. While governments have made efforts to resettle war-hit communities, Tamils continue to feel unsettled due to ongoing conflicts and insecurity. The issue of thousands of missing persons, who were seen surrendering to the army, has remained unresolved, stirring discontent and distress among families. The UN has called on the Sri Lankan government to disclose the whereabouts of those subjected to enforced disappearance and hold those responsible accountable.
