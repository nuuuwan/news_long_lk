    "This week, I have a new story out about Quaise, a geothermal startup that\u2019s trying to commercialize new drilling technology. Using a device called a gyrotron, the company wants to drill deeper, cheaper, in an effort to unlock geothermal power anywhere on the planet. (For all the details, check it out here.)\u00a0 For the story, I visited Quaise\u2019s headquarters in Houston. I also took a trip across town to Nabors Industries, Quaise\u2019s investor and tech partner and one of the biggest drilling companies in the world.\u00a0 Related StoryThis startup wants to use beams of energy to drill geothermal wellsQuaise is taking its technology from the lab to field trials for the first time this year.",
    "Standing on top of a drilling rig in the backyard of Nabors\u2019s headquarters, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the role oil and gas companies are playing in the energy transition. This industry has resources and energy expertise\u2014but also a vested interest in fossil fuels. Can it really be part of addressing climate change? The relationship between Quaise and Nabors is one that we see increasingly often in climate tech\u2014a startup partnering up with an established company in a similar field. (Another one that comes to mind is in the cement industry, where Sublime Systems has seen a lot of support from legacy players including Holcim, one of the biggest cement companies in the world.)",
    "Quaise got an early investment from Nabors in 2021, to the tune of $12 million. Now the company also serves as a technical partner for the startup.\u00a0 \u201cWe are agnostic to what hole we\u2019re drilling,\u201d says Cameron Maresh, a project engineer on the energy transition team at Nabors Industries. The company is working on other investments and projects in the geothermal industry, Maresh says, and the work with Quaise is the culmination of a yearslong collaboration: \u201cWe\u2019re just truly excited to see what Quaise can do.\u201d",
    "From the outside, this sort of partnership makes a lot of sense for Quaise. It gets resources and expertise. Meanwhile, Nabors is getting involved with an innovative company that could represent a new direction for geothermal. And maybe more to the point, if fossil fuels are to be phased out, this deal gives the company a stake in next-generation energy production. There is so much potential for oil and gas companies to play a productive role in addressing climate change. One report from the International Energy Agency examined the role these legacy players could take: \u00a0\u201cEnergy transitions can happen without the engagement of the oil and gas industry, but the journey to net zero will be more costly and difficult to navigate if they are not on board,\u201d the authors wrote.\u00a0 In the agency\u2019s blueprint for what a net-zero emissions energy system could look like in 2050, about 30% of energy could come from sources where the oil and gas industry\u2019s knowledge and resources are useful. That includes hydrogen, liquid biofuels, biomethane, carbon capture, and geothermal.\u00a0 But so far, the industry has hardly lived up to its potential as a positive force for the climate. Also in that report, the IEA pointed out that oil and gas producers made up only about 1% of global investment in climate tech in 2022. Investment has ticked up a bit since then, but still, it\u2019s tough to argue that the industry is committed.\u00a0 Related StoryWho\u2019s to blame for climate change? It\u2019s surprisingly complicated.The world\u2019s biggest polluters, by the numbers.",
    "And now that climate tech is falling out of fashion with the government in the US, I\u2019d venture to guess that we\u2019re going to see oil and gas companies increasingly pulling back on their investments and promises.\u00a0 BP recently backtracked on previous commitments to cut oil and gas production and invest in clean energy. And last year the company announced that it had written off $1.1 billion in offshore wind investments in 2023 and wanted to sell other wind assets. Shell closed down all its hydrogen fueling stations for vehicles in California last year. (This might not be all that big a loss, since EVs are beating hydrogen by a huge margin in the US, but it\u2019s still worth noting.)\u00a0 So oil and gas companies are investing what amounts to pennies and often backtrack when the political winds change direction. And, let\u2019s not forget, fossil-fuel companies have a long history of behaving badly.\u00a0 In perhaps the most notorious example, scientists at Exxon modeled climate change in the 1970s, and their forecasts turned out to be quite accurate. Rather than publish that research, the company downplayed how climate change might affect the planet. (For what it\u2019s worth, company representatives have argued that this was less of a coverup and more of an internal discussion that wasn\u2019t fit to be shared outside the company.)",
    "While fossil fuels are still part of our near-term future, oil and gas companies, and particularly producers, would need to make drastic changes to align with climate goals\u2014changes that wouldn\u2019t be in their financial interest. Few seem inclined to really take the turn needed.\u00a0 As the IEA report puts it: \u00a0\u201cIn practice, no one committed to change should wait for someone else to move first.\u201d This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter.
