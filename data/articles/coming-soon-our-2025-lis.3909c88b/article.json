    "The need to cut emissions and adapt to our warming world is growing more urgent. This year, we\u2019ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, for the past two years, MIT Technology Review has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We\u2019re excited to share that we\u2019ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.\u00a0  The list features businesses from around the world that are building technologies to reduce emissions or address the impacts of climate change. They represent advances across a wide range of industries, from agriculture and transportation to energy and critical minerals.\u00a0 One notable difference about this year\u2019s list is that we\u2019ve focused on fewer firms\u2014we\u2019ll highlight 10 instead of the 15 we\u2019ve recognized in previous years.",
    "This change reflects the times: Climate science and technology are in a dramatically different place from where they were just one year ago. The US, the world\u2019s largest economy and historically its biggest polluter, has made a U-turn on climate policy as the Trump administration cancels hundreds of billions of dollars in grants, tax credits, and loans designed to support the industry and climate research.\u00a0\u00a0 And the stark truth is that time is of the essence. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, the UN treaty that aimed to limit global warming by setting a goal of cutting emissions so that temperatures would rise no more than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial temperatures. Today, experts agree that we\u2019ve virtually run out of time to reach that goal and will need to act fast to limit warming to less than 2 \u00b0C.",

    "The companies on this year\u2019s list are inventing and scaling technologies that could help. There\u2019s a wide array of firms represented, from early-stage startups to multibillion-dollar businesses. Their technologies run the gamut from electric vehicles to the materials that scaffold our world.\u00a0 Of course, we can\u2019t claim to be able to predict the future: Not all the businesses we\u2019ve recognized will succeed. But we\u2019ve done our best to choose companies with a solid technical footing, as well as feasible plans for bringing their solutions to the right market and scaling them effectively.\u00a0 We\u2019re excited to share the list with you in just a few days. These companies are helping address one of the most crucial challenges of our time. Who knows\u2014maybe you\u2019ll even come away feeling a little more hopeful. hide"
