    "Sri Lanka tragically experiences some 8 to 10 road deaths daily",
    "Here\u2019s a note of caution to all fellow motorists driving on A6 towards Dambulla. There\u2019s a permanent Police Post located between Melsiripura and Beligamuwa.",
    "Yours truly was driving from Kurunegala on A6 targeting Dambulla for breakfast on Friday 3 October when a long line of slow-moving traffic mostly consisting of heavy vehicles such as \u2018container-trucks\u2019 and buses were observed.",
    "Using commonsensical safety techniques of 100% clear visibility both front and rear were deployed and the gradual overtaking manoeuvres adopted ensuring overtaking was done over \u2018broken white lines\u2019! The last of the road hogs crawling at centre of road was encountered: a fuel bowser at snail\u2019s pace!",
    "Here too the Safety-First checks of clear visibility in front and rear for overtaking was done and completed only to be hailed by a couple of traffic cops strategically planted to see whether when overtaking the white line was crossed even fleetingly! They were obviously licking their lips at \u2018good fortune\u2019 of nabbing unsuspecting drivers that morning! Yes indeed, there were at least a dozen perplexed drivers nabbed during that brief period of a mere five minutes!",
    "When online payments were selected as mode of settlement of fines those having Apple phones were told that the system does not \u2018accept\u2019 i-Phones! Only Android phones could! Fortuitously the Beligamuwa Sub Post Office was located close by for those who picked or rather compelled to choose the manual system!",
    "Fines payment receipt in hand and given to the traffic cops, we were handed back our precious driving licence after being in custody of the Police, albeit briefly. And we were then on our way after sacrificing a good 30-minute delay!",
    "The analogy of fishing in estuaries comes to mind! After all estuaries are prime fishing spots because they are productive \u2018nurseries\u2019 with abundant food, shelter and varied habitats, attracting a high density and diversity of fish, including both freshwater and saltwater species. Get the drift? Having that Police Post Hut strategically located there is a \u2018sure catch\u2019 for those lazy traffic cops amidst a myriad other blatant and life-threatening traffic offences being carried out literally every second witnessed by all law-abiding motorists!",
    "To prevent road accidents, the traffic police should strictly enforce traffic laws, particularly on speeding, drunken driving, overtaking \u2018blind\u2019 at speed at dangerous road bends, changing lanes at will endangering all; deftly joining traffic on main road from a side street with nary a glance at traffic on the main road, toddlers on front seat on laps of doting mothers, use of mobile phones on the move; disregarding traffic lights especially at night \u2013 inviting collisions!",
    "While also promoting safe infrastructure and driver behaviour. Key strategies include increased enforcement, education on the importance of safety equipment like helmets and seatbelts, and promoting defensive driving through awareness campaigns. Additionally, police should ensure adequate infrastructure and collaborate with authorities for robust driver and vehicle licensing systems.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s driving licence issuance system has morphed into a sick joke with notably blatant corruption occupying centre stage. No wonder many \u2018new drivers\u2019 are mostly incompetent and appear to be clueless of the Highway Code leave alone globally accepted defensive driving techniques!",
    "The following brief points are given for the benefit of all road users and indeed for the edification of Sri Lanka\u2019s Traffic Police: Oh! For the days of much respected ex IGP Cyril Herath who sent a team of young Police Officers to Singapore to study the highly effective Traffic Management Systems. These Police teams returned brimming with new ideas and successful methods to be replicated in Sri Lanka. New and practical traffic rules were introduced ably handled by respected officers like Director Traffic, the legendary T. Perinpanayagam.",
    "However, with the retirement of IGP Cyril Herath these innovative traffic systems, enforcement and legislation were gradually abandoned. It was reported that the young Police Officers who were trained in Singapore were inexplicably assigned other duties far removed from traffic according to then reliable Police sources. What moronic, totally unacceptable thinking then!",
    "Enforcement and legislation",
    "Strict law enforcement:\u00a0Focus on high-risk behaviours such as excessive speeding, especially in built up areas, drunken driving, and driving under the influence of drugs. Also driving when sleep deprived \u2013 an accident waiting to happen!",
    "Mobile phone restrictions:\u00a0Enforce laws against using mobile phones or other distractions while driving, as this significantly increases accident risk.",
    "Helmet and seatbelt laws:\u00a0Consistently enforce universal helmet laws for motorcyclists and seatbelt laws for all vehicle occupants. Obviously, motorcyclists must properly and securely strap their helmets before they ride off!",
    "Education and awareness",
    "Driver behaviour:\u00a0Educate drivers on the importance of defensive driving, maintaining safe following distances, and being alert to other road users.",
    "Safety equipment:\u00a0Conduct public awareness campaigns via radio, TV, social-media, etc. emphasising the correct use of safety equipment like seatbelts, helmets, and child restraint seats. Kids under 6 must occupy the rear seat only and never be perched on dotting Mama\u2019s lap on front seat!",
    "Traffic rules:\u00a0Ensure drivers understand and follow traffic signs, signals, and road safety rules. All vehicular drivers must carry The Highway Code booklet in whatever language in cubby hole. The contents of The Highway Code booklet must be strictly introduced in ALL schools and studied with accompanying pictures and graphics.",
    "During our school days in the 1950s and early 1960s the Traffic Police used to regularly conduct traffic safety programs. Traffic safety rules, such do\u2019s and don\u2019ts must be drilled into ALL children and young adults!",
    "The blind eye seemingly shown by the Traffic Police on serial traffic offenders such as three-wheelers and motorcyclists who appear to be a law unto themselves with their dangerous overtaking left, right and centre on busy city roads, joining main streets from side lanes without slowing down, suicidal sways, coupled with Police inexplicably manning junctions by having traffic light signals perpetually on amber perhaps collectively contribute to 50% of road congestion and gridlock. It may sound utopian but if all road users including pedestrians follow road rules of the Highway Code, traffic will move well say 50% smoother and faster than at present chaos as if cities are in a state of anarchy",
    "Infrastructure and policy",
    "Infrastructure design:",
    "Advocate for and implement road infrastructure that is safe for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists as per Highway Code of Sri Lanka.",
    "Graduated Driver Licensing:",
    "Support and promote Graduated Drivers Licensing (GDL) systems to help young drivers gain experience in low-risk conditions.",
    "Note: A Graduated Driver License [GDL] program is a multi-stage driver\u2019s licensing system designed to provide new and inexperienced drivers with more time and opportunities to gain driving experience in low-risk situations before they are granted full driving privileges.",
    "Vehicle and driver licensing:",
    "Collaborate with authorities to establish and maintain robust globally practiced [e.g. Canada, Australia, UK, Singapore, UAE, etc.] vehicle and driver licensing systems to improve compliance with safety standards. Sri Lanka does not need to re-invent the wheel! Just accept and adopt these globally proven effective driver licensing systems!",
    "Train officers to anticipate and react to changing road conditions, and to be aware of potential hazards like blind spots and poor weather. E.g. the thick and sudden mist that envelopes many up country areas like Haputale, Nanu-Oya, Hakgala, Maturata, upper Hewaheta, Pattipola, etc.",
    "Simple tip: When visibility is almost zero, don\u2019t try to be a hero! Oncoming traffic too may not see you! So just pull over to a safe vacant spot, switch on hazard blinking lights and stay put until the mist clears for safe passage. Remember! Always Safety First, period!",
    "The blind eye seemingly shown by the Traffic Police on serial traffic offenders such as three-wheelers and motorcyclists who appear to be a law unto themselves with their dangerous overtaking left, right and centre on busy city roads, joining main streets from side lanes without slowing down, suicidal sways, coupled with Police inexplicably manning junctions by having traffic light signals perpetually on amber perhaps collectively contribute to 50% of road congestion and gridlock.",
    "It may sound utopian but if all road users including pedestrians follow road rules of the Highway Code, traffic will move well say 50% smoother and faster than at present chaos as if cities are in a state of anarchy!",
    "Focus on vulnerable road users:",
    "The Traffic Police must pay special attention to protecting pedestrians, children, and senior citizens who are more vulnerable in road traffic. Pedestrian crossings must be adequately illuminated and clearly marked with regular painting. Always establish eye contact with driver and pedestrians. Those who jay walk must be fined. Repeat offenders must be arrested and prosecuted like in Singapore.",
    "Expressway and up-country driving",
    "Expressway driving like up-country is a different \u2018ball game\u2019!",
    "Always plan ahead: Route, stops for food, bio breaks, rest, etc.",
    "[1] Re-check tyres for recommended tyre pressures \u2013 front, rear and even the spare \u2013 two days before journey. I say \u2018two days\u2019 as if a defect or small air leak is noticed there\u2019s ample time to attend and fix the issue.",
    "[2] Never drive with tyres that have exceeded five years. Old tyres especially at speed on an Expressway can potentially burst, causing the vehicle to veer off track with disastrous consequences!",
    "[3] As part of your planning routine always re check liquid levels in engine [coolant, engine oil, brake, steering fluid, etc.]. It\u2019s a better option to service your car by the agents or recognised facility, say a few days before a \u2018long trip\u2019 up country for the holidays!",
    "[4] Never over-load your vehicle as it could adversely affect your suspension, steering and braking mechanisms in an emergency.",
    "[5] Always stick to your corner when negotiating bends up country and get on to lower gears or deploy \u2018Hill Descent\u2019 switch when going on steep slopes down-hill instead of continuously braking as it could lead to excessive friction and heat build-up rendering your brakes ineffective.",
    "[6] The Expressway Police must be empowered to disallow \u2018unsafe\u2019 vehicles from entering the Expressway such as old, obviously poorly maintained vehicles with inadequate lighting, especially rear/brake lights sans reflectors; vehicles with \u2018inadequate tyre tread or indeed \u2018bald tyres!",
    "[7] The Expressway is NOT a Racing Track, period! Join a Motor Racing Club if you want to race on public roads, especially Expressways. Never exceed prescribed speed limits. Never overtake \u2018too close\u2019 to others!",
    "[8] When attempting to over-taker a slower vehicle always signal your intent with trafficators [signal lights] and get back to the slow lane also using your signal lights. The international language of vehicular drivers is your \u2018signal lights\u2019 \u2013 use them always. Never surprise another overtaking with zero signal lights, blind. These are killer habits!",
    "[9] Never \u2018tail gate\u2019 at speed especially on Expressway to obviously avoid multiple pile ups and God forbid, fatalities!",
    "Sri Lanka tragically experiences some 8 to 10 road deaths daily. And these grisly numbers are increasing with no visible let-up, sadly.",
    "Mr. IGP and DIG Traffic \u2013 please peruse these brief practical notes above and ensure that your Traffic Police are adequately trained to imbibe world-class traffic safety and effective monitoring systems \u2013 no doubt this task is a humungous challenge. But our motorists and indeed all road users including the more vulnerable pedestrians especially children and senior citizens deserve that much more care.",
    "Obviously, the prime emphasis must be \u2018prevention\u2019 or at least minimising road related traffic accidents, most times, \u2018preventable\u2019!",
    "It is therefore far better for your Traffic Police to move away from their pathetic obsession with the \u2018White Line\u2019 and be well-trained to prevent or at least minimise mostly preventable road accidents that snuff out precious lives 8 to 10 daily and/or leave them maimed for life!",
    "Even on day of writing this article, Monday 6 October 2025, two horrendous fatal accidents were reported:",
    "[1] \u201cAt least three people were killed with three others injured in a collision between a lorry and a bus in the Narammala area \u2013 Police\u201d",
    "[2] \u201cThree women were killed and a fourth injured when they were run over by a car while crossing a road in Doluwa, Gampola \u2013 Police\u201d",
    "When will this carnage end?",
    "Let us all contribute to make our roads safer in Sri Lanka!"
