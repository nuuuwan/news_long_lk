Sri Lanka tragically experiences some 8 to 10 road deaths daily

Here’s a note of caution to all fellow motorists driving on A6 towards Dambulla. There’s a permanent Police Post located between Melsiripura and Beligamuwa.

Yours truly was driving from Kurunegala on A6 targeting Dambulla for breakfast on Friday 3 October when a long line of slow-moving traffic mostly consisting of heavy vehicles such as ‘container-trucks’ and buses were observed.

Using commonsensical safety techniques of 100% clear visibility both front and rear were deployed and the gradual overtaking manoeuvres adopted ensuring overtaking was done over ‘broken white lines’! The last of the road hogs crawling at centre of road was encountered: a fuel bowser at snail’s pace!

Here too the Safety-First checks of clear visibility in front and rear for overtaking was done and completed only to be hailed by a couple of traffic cops strategically planted to see whether when overtaking the white line was crossed even fleetingly! They were obviously licking their lips at ‘good fortune’ of nabbing unsuspecting drivers that morning! Yes indeed, there were at least a dozen perplexed drivers nabbed during that brief period of a mere five minutes!

When online payments were selected as mode of settlement of fines those having Apple phones were told that the system does not ‘accept’ i-Phones! Only Android phones could! Fortuitously the Beligamuwa Sub Post Office was located close by for those who picked or rather compelled to choose the manual system!

Fines payment receipt in hand and given to the traffic cops, we were handed back our precious driving licence after being in custody of the Police, albeit briefly. And we were then on our way after sacrificing a good 30-minute delay!

The analogy of fishing in estuaries comes to mind! After all estuaries are prime fishing spots because they are productive ‘nurseries’ with abundant food, shelter and varied habitats, attracting a high density and diversity of fish, including both freshwater and saltwater species. Get the drift? Having that Police Post Hut strategically located there is a ‘sure catch’ for those lazy traffic cops amidst a myriad other blatant and life-threatening traffic offences being carried out literally every second witnessed by all law-abiding motorists!

To prevent road accidents, the traffic police should strictly enforce traffic laws, particularly on speeding, drunken driving, overtaking ‘blind’ at speed at dangerous road bends, changing lanes at will endangering all; deftly joining traffic on main road from a side street with nary a glance at traffic on the main road, toddlers on front seat on laps of doting mothers, use of mobile phones on the move; disregarding traffic lights especially at night – inviting collisions!

While also promoting safe infrastructure and driver behaviour. Key strategies include increased enforcement, education on the importance of safety equipment like helmets and seatbelts, and promoting defensive driving through awareness campaigns. Additionally, police should ensure adequate infrastructure and collaborate with authorities for robust driver and vehicle licensing systems.

Sri Lanka’s driving licence issuance system has morphed into a sick joke with notably blatant corruption occupying centre stage. No wonder many ‘new drivers’ are mostly incompetent and appear to be clueless of the Highway Code leave alone globally accepted defensive driving techniques!

The following brief points are given for the benefit of all road users and indeed for the edification of Sri Lanka’s Traffic Police: Oh! For the days of much respected ex IGP Cyril Herath who sent a team of young Police Officers to Singapore to study the highly effective Traffic Management Systems. These Police teams returned brimming with new ideas and successful methods to be replicated in Sri Lanka. New and practical traffic rules were introduced ably handled by respected officers like Director Traffic, the legendary T. Perinpanayagam.

However, with the retirement of IGP Cyril Herath these innovative traffic systems, enforcement and legislation were gradually abandoned. It was reported that the young Police Officers who were trained in Singapore were inexplicably assigned other duties far removed from traffic according to then reliable Police sources. What moronic, totally unacceptable thinking then!

Enforcement and legislation

Strict law enforcement: Focus on high-risk behaviours such as excessive speeding, especially in built up areas, drunken driving, and driving under the influence of drugs. Also driving when sleep deprived – an accident waiting to happen!

Mobile phone restrictions: Enforce laws against using mobile phones or other distractions while driving, as this significantly increases accident risk.

Helmet and seatbelt laws: Consistently enforce universal helmet laws for motorcyclists and seatbelt laws for all vehicle occupants. Obviously, motorcyclists must properly and securely strap their helmets before they ride off!

Education and awareness

Driver behaviour: Educate drivers on the importance of defensive driving, maintaining safe following distances, and being alert to other road users.

Safety equipment: Conduct public awareness campaigns via radio, TV, social-media, etc. emphasising the correct use of safety equipment like seatbelts, helmets, and child restraint seats. Kids under 6 must occupy the rear seat only and never be perched on dotting Mama’s lap on front seat!

Traffic rules: Ensure drivers understand and follow traffic signs, signals, and road safety rules. All vehicular drivers must carry The Highway Code booklet in whatever language in cubby hole. The contents of The Highway Code booklet must be strictly introduced in ALL schools and studied with accompanying pictures and graphics.

During our school days in the 1950s and early 1960s the Traffic Police used to regularly conduct traffic safety programs. Traffic safety rules, such do’s and don’ts must be drilled into ALL children and young adults!

The blind eye seemingly shown by the Traffic Police on serial traffic offenders such as three-wheelers and motorcyclists who appear to be a law unto themselves with their dangerous overtaking left, right and centre on busy city roads, joining main streets from side lanes without slowing down, suicidal sways, coupled with Police inexplicably manning junctions by having traffic light signals perpetually on amber perhaps collectively contribute to 50% of road congestion and gridlock. It may sound utopian but if all road users including pedestrians follow road rules of the Highway Code, traffic will move well say 50% smoother and faster than at present chaos as if cities are in a state of anarchy

Infrastructure and policy

Infrastructure design:

Advocate for and implement road infrastructure that is safe for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists as per Highway Code of Sri Lanka.

Graduated Driver Licensing:

Support and promote Graduated Drivers Licensing (GDL) systems to help young drivers gain experience in low-risk conditions.

Note: A Graduated Driver License [GDL] program is a multi-stage driver’s licensing system designed to provide new and inexperienced drivers with more time and opportunities to gain driving experience in low-risk situations before they are granted full driving privileges.

Vehicle and driver licensing:

Collaborate with authorities to establish and maintain robust globally practiced [e.g. Canada, Australia, UK, Singapore, UAE, etc.] vehicle and driver licensing systems to improve compliance with safety standards. Sri Lanka does not need to re-invent the wheel! Just accept and adopt these globally proven effective driver licensing systems!

Train officers to anticipate and react to changing road conditions, and to be aware of potential hazards like blind spots and poor weather. E.g. the thick and sudden mist that envelopes many up country areas like Haputale, Nanu-Oya, Hakgala, Maturata, upper Hewaheta, Pattipola, etc.

Simple tip: When visibility is almost zero, don’t try to be a hero! Oncoming traffic too may not see you! So just pull over to a safe vacant spot, switch on hazard blinking lights and stay put until the mist clears for safe passage. Remember! Always Safety First, period!

The blind eye seemingly shown by the Traffic Police on serial traffic offenders such as three-wheelers and motorcyclists who appear to be a law unto themselves with their dangerous overtaking left, right and centre on busy city roads, joining main streets from side lanes without slowing down, suicidal sways, coupled with Police inexplicably manning junctions by having traffic light signals perpetually on amber perhaps collectively contribute to 50% of road congestion and gridlock.

It may sound utopian but if all road users including pedestrians follow road rules of the Highway Code, traffic will move well say 50% smoother and faster than at present chaos as if cities are in a state of anarchy!

Focus on vulnerable road users:

The Traffic Police must pay special attention to protecting pedestrians, children, and senior citizens who are more vulnerable in road traffic. Pedestrian crossings must be adequately illuminated and clearly marked with regular painting. Always establish eye contact with driver and pedestrians. Those who jay walk must be fined. Repeat offenders must be arrested and prosecuted like in Singapore.

Expressway and up-country driving

Expressway driving like up-country is a different ‘ball game’!

Always plan ahead: Route, stops for food, bio breaks, rest, etc.

[1] Re-check tyres for recommended tyre pressures – front, rear and even the spare – two days before journey. I say ‘two days’ as if a defect or small air leak is noticed there’s ample time to attend and fix the issue.

[2] Never drive with tyres that have exceeded five years. Old tyres especially at speed on an Expressway can potentially burst, causing the vehicle to veer off track with disastrous consequences!

[3] As part of your planning routine always re check liquid levels in engine [coolant, engine oil, brake, steering fluid, etc.]. It’s a better option to service your car by the agents or recognised facility, say a few days before a ‘long trip’ up country for the holidays!

[4] Never over-load your vehicle as it could adversely affect your suspension, steering and braking mechanisms in an emergency.

[5] Always stick to your corner when negotiating bends up country and get on to lower gears or deploy ‘Hill Descent’ switch when going on steep slopes down-hill instead of continuously braking as it could lead to excessive friction and heat build-up rendering your brakes ineffective.

[6] The Expressway Police must be empowered to disallow ‘unsafe’ vehicles from entering the Expressway such as old, obviously poorly maintained vehicles with inadequate lighting, especially rear/brake lights sans reflectors; vehicles with ‘inadequate tyre tread or indeed ‘bald tyres!

[7] The Expressway is NOT a Racing Track, period! Join a Motor Racing Club if you want to race on public roads, especially Expressways. Never exceed prescribed speed limits. Never overtake ‘too close’ to others!

[8] When attempting to over-taker a slower vehicle always signal your intent with trafficators [signal lights] and get back to the slow lane also using your signal lights. The international language of vehicular drivers is your ‘signal lights’ – use them always. Never surprise another overtaking with zero signal lights, blind. These are killer habits!

[9] Never ‘tail gate’ at speed especially on Expressway to obviously avoid multiple pile ups and God forbid, fatalities!

Sri Lanka tragically experiences some 8 to 10 road deaths daily. And these grisly numbers are increasing with no visible let-up, sadly.

Mr. IGP and DIG Traffic – please peruse these brief practical notes above and ensure that your Traffic Police are adequately trained to imbibe world-class traffic safety and effective monitoring systems – no doubt this task is a humungous challenge. But our motorists and indeed all road users including the more vulnerable pedestrians especially children and senior citizens deserve that much more care.

Obviously, the prime emphasis must be ‘prevention’ or at least minimising road related traffic accidents, most times, ‘preventable’!

It is therefore far better for your Traffic Police to move away from their pathetic obsession with the ‘White Line’ and be well-trained to prevent or at least minimise mostly preventable road accidents that snuff out precious lives 8 to 10 daily and/or leave them maimed for life!

Even on day of writing this article, Monday 6 October 2025, two horrendous fatal accidents were reported:

[1] “At least three people were killed with three others injured in a collision between a lorry and a bus in the Narammala area – Police”

[2] “Three women were killed and a fourth injured when they were run over by a car while crossing a road in Doluwa, Gampola – Police”

When will this carnage end?

Let us all contribute to make our roads safer in Sri Lanka!
