# Ukraine scenarios: what will happen under Trump?

## Summary 🤖

1. 🇺🇸 If Donald Trump wins the 2024 US presidential election, he intends to bring both Ukraine and Russia to peace talks soon after taking office in 2025. 
2. 🇺🇦 Ukraine's participation might be secured by threatening to withhold US assistance, forcing Ukraine into potential peace talks.
3. 🤝 Peace talks appear beneficial to both sides, although a final deal satisfying both sides is unlikely.
4. 🇷🇺 Russia probably won't support any peace treaty that requires it to return its recently-seized territories back to Ukraine.
5. 🇺🇦 Ukraine's government also won't likely condone to officially give up the provinces seized by Russia.
6.  📅 If talks break down, conflict could resume with Russia continuing territorial gains and US aid to Ukraine reducing after mid-2025.
7. 🇪🇺 Increased European assistance is expected but might not suffice to give Ukraine a turning point in the conflict due to limitations on political will or industrial capabilities.
8. Alternative scenario 1: 🕊️ A fragile ceasefire remains no peace deal comes into effect. This could occur if both sides become hesitant to continue warring due to potential reprisals and constraints. 
9. Alternative scenario 2: 💪 Europe delivers sufficient aid to keep Ukraine in the fight and potentially regain some territories.
10. 🎲 Low-probability scenarios also exists like an unexpected peace deal in 2025 or a change in the next US government's approach to Ukraine.

Ukraine scenarios: what will happen under Trump?

ElectionsForecastingPoliticsUS electionAmericasUnited StatesCountry Analysis

Assuming that he wins the November 2024 US presidential election, we expect Donald Trump to force both Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table soon after he takes office in January 2025. Mr Trump has consistently said that he would seek to bring the war to a swift close, and his choice of the Ukraine-sceptic JD Vance as a running mate reinforces this. To secure Ukraine’s participation, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the Ukrainian president, may be presented with a choice between participating in talks or continuing to fight without any additional US assistance. Although this is a threat that the US is unlikely to implement fully, as it will be keen to avoid the criticism that followed its abrupt departure from Afghanistan, uncertainty about the degree of reduction in US aid will be sufficient to force Ukraine into peace talks. Meanwhile, participating in peace negotiations is a win-win for Russia: if it does not get what it wants (at a minimum, formal control of the territories it currently controls) then it will have an opportunity to rearm, while Ukraine is weakened by reduced US aid.

Baseline forecast: war continues but Europe fails to compensate for lower US aid, resulting in an eventual bad peace deal forced on Ukraine

A final deal that satisfies both sides and leads to a permanent peace settlement is extremely unlikely. There are several issues that we believe will prompt peace talks to break down: Russia will not sign up to any long-term peace treaty that requires it to return to 2022 borders, still less 2014 ones, particularly as it is currently in a stronger position compared with Ukraine. Equally, Ukraine’s government will find it politically untenable to formally cede the provinces seized by Russia since 2022. Security guarantees for Ukraine are another stumbling block, as Russia will find it very difficult to accept a deal that reinforces Ukraine’s security via NATO membership. Ukraine, conversely, will be reluctant to sign a peace treaty that it feels does not provide enough protection against the risk of another Russian invasion further down the line.

Once peace talks break down the conflict would be likely to resume, with Russia believing that it could make further territorial gains. Already approved aid packages will help to provide enough funds and equipment to keep Ukraine in the war until at least mid-2025, but US aid is then likely to drop sharply. Our baseline expectation is that Europe will increase its assistance to Ukraine in response. However, we do not believe that the European allies have the political will or industrial capability to give Ukraine the advantage it needs to turn the tide of the conflict. Europe’s factories cannot produce armaments fast enough and it simply does not spend enough on defence. In the absence of much US support, rifts are likely to emerge between European governments over time about how money is spent and the logic of sustaining a conflict in which Ukraine is struggling to retake territory.

Assuming that Ukraine continues to fight, it will be met by the same Surovikin line defences (a Russian-built fortification line designed to repel Ukrainian forces) that it failed to penetrate in 2023. On the assumption that Russia has the ability to continue the conflict in the longer term, it would be likely to launch a counter-attack, Ukraine may then end up back where it is today, slowly being pushed back towards the Dnieper river. In this scenario, peace talks would eventually come (towards the end of the forecast period), but by this time the US would have washed its hands of the conflict and Russia would be in a stronger position. Ukraine and its allies would be exhausted. The terms of a ceasefire would be worse than those that Ukraine might get in 2025.

Alternative scenario 1: frozen conflict, with a fragile ceasefire persisting but no peace deal

Even though we expect peace talks to break down in 2025, it is very possible that the conflict does not resume and that a fragile ceasefire persists. Ukraine faces constraints in terms of resources (both equipment and personnel), and, although the Russian economy has fared well to date, there are clear signs of overheating. An end to the fighting would provide scope for some recovery and readjustment. This would be an outcome that both sides could find acceptable, if imperfect.

In this scenario, the key question would be what would prevent both sides from resuming the conflict. For Ukraine, the absence of US aid would make it hesitant to do so, as it would fear losing more ground to Russia. Meanwhile, Europe would be focused on continuing to bolster Ukraine’s military, in a bid to deter Russia from launching fresh attacks. Maintaining a ceasefire, or frozen conflict, would hinge on both sides fearing potential reprisals if they started fighting again. The international community might also offer incentives to both sides, including multilateral and bilateral funding for reconstruction in Ukraine and potentially some (limited) sanctions relief for Russia. A frozen conflict would also serve the goal of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, of preventing further NATO expansion eastward. The absence of a final peace deal would dissuade private-sector creditors from funding reconstruction in Ukraine, which would hamper the pace of its economic recovery. There would be a significant risk that the fragile ceasefire might degenerate into war again later in the forecast period.

Alternative scenario 2: Europe steps up, delivering enough aid to push Russia back

It is also possible that Europe might outperform our expectations and do enough to keep Ukraine in the fight. The EU has shown resolve beyond what most people thought possible in 2022; its members have arguably surprised even themselves. The appointment of Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister, as the bloc’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy places a Russia hawk in a key role, suggesting that the EU is serious about the threat. Exceptional situations call for exceptional responses, and Europe may surprise once again. More EU bonds could be issued to finance the war, and reluctance to buy US weapons may be overcome, which would boost Ukraine’s defensive capabilities. It is also possible that Europe would approve the use of part of Russia’s frozen international reserves to finance Ukraine (and potentially the capital itself). In this scenario, Ukraine might still struggle to launch a significant counterattack that would push Russia out, but the longer it stayed in the conflict, the tougher we would expect things to become for Russia. Ukraine might be able to regain control of some territory.

Low-probability scenarios

There are a number of alternative paths that we currently believe are extremely unlikely, but given the fluid nature of the conflict and uncertainty about the next US government’s approach to Ukraine, may become more feasible if the underlying situation changes. These include a peace deal in 2025, in which Russia ends up with formal control of most of the territory that it currently controls; that Mr Putin does something that angers Mr Trump sufficiently to cause a scenario in which the US directs even more resources to Ukraine; or that Europe does not increase funding once the US draws back (resulting in a forced peace deal on terms that are unfavourable to Ukraine midway through the forecast period).
