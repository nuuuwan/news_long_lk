Continuing the provisions of the PTA under the guise of a similar bill with a different name will leave the door open to violent suppression by the State

Following is a public petition from the Movement for People’s Council to repeal the PTA and remove VAT, signed by more than 1,300 people, and handed over yesterday (11) to the Presidential Secretariat

The main objective in passing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) of 1979 was to suppress the minority communities, as well as political activists and parties aligned against the ruling classes. Although meant as a temporary measure, every administration in the last four decades has taken advantage of the PTA to suppress the people.

The PTA was used with deadly effect against thousands of youth during the 1988/9 insurrections in the south, against Tamil people in the north and east during the civil war and in the post-war period, against the Muslim community following the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, and most recently against activists involved in the 2022 popular uprising. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the main constituent party of the current Government, has been a prominent victim of the PTA.

Consequently, progressive sections of society, political actors, and activists have fought to have the PTA repealed for as long as it has been in effect. There have been promises made both nationally and in international forums to repeal the PTA. During the 2024 elections, the National People’s Power (NPP) party undertook to abolish the PTA if brought to power, as publicly stated before the people of this country and included in the NPP’s official policy documents. We therefore demand that the Government use its parliamentary majority to repeal the PTA without further excuses or justifications. We demand that the Government fulfil the powerful mandate given to it by the voting public in this regard to repeal this unjust and draconian law.

There have been various media statements concerning Government plans to repeal the PTA but introduce a similar bill in its place. Continuing the provisions of the PTA under the guise of a similar bill with a different name will leave the door open to violent suppression by the State, especially as the general law is more than adequate to deal with suspects.

The previous Wickremesinghe Government increased value-added taxes (VAT) from 15% to 18% from 1 January 2024, resulting in extremely high prices of goods and services, especially medicines, essential food items, and school supplies. Thousands of families are grappling with the unbearable cost of living. It is tremendously unjust to place the burden of increasing State revenues on the general public in this manner at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Before it assumed power, the NPP’s official policy statements explicitly promised to renegotiate the harsh IMF conditionalities and provide tax relief. Instead we see this Government falling in line with the IMF. Working people especially cannot meet their most basic needs, causing widespread malnutrition, hunger, poor health, and suffering.

We urge the Government to substantially reduce the VAT and, as promised by the NPP during its election campaign, to take urgent measures to completely eliminate VAT on medicines, essential food items, and school books and equipment as soon as possible.
