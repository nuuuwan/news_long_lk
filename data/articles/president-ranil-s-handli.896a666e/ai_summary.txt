Social media users criticise the handling of the 2022 political and economic crisis by Sri Lanka's current President. The mismanagement and corruption that led to the crisis cannot be solely blamed on the President, and those responsible must be held accountable. Despite the challenges, the President provided steady and consistent leadership through this historic reset of the country. There have been problems, such as an increase in lending rates and the declarance of bankruptcy. The decision to go to the IMF for relief was the last resort, although it did lead to difficult conditions. The author argues that what the country needs is visionary leadership to ensure a robust economy and industrial base. Further challenges loom in 2025 due to growing debt problems and anticipated slower growth, but with strategic leadership, there is opportunity for long-term stability. In the 2024 Presidential elections, voters hope to choose a candidate that can offer this vision and leadership. The author calls for improved education and professional training to increase job opportunities and a politician who understands the need for broader economic and industrial growth.
