    "All too often, traditional DEI programming and policy have focused on how not to behave. This focus on the negative can make people so worried about saying or doing the wrong thing that they disengage or get mad and push back. In this article, the authors argue...more",
    "It matters when employees have a strong sense of belonging, or feel like they fit at a company: They\u2019re more engaged, innovative, and productive. To foster that kind of deep inclusion, companies often try to create a warm and welcoming culture, perhaps by supporting employee resource groups or sponsoring company events such as happy hours and team offsites. But it\u2019s not the happy hour that inspires you at work \u2014 not really, not deeply, not in the best circumstances. What really matters is whether employees actually feel like they\u2019re contributing to the work at hand.",
    "We think the traditional approach to DEI is incomplete \u2014 and because it\u2019s incomplete, we suspect it\u2019s contributing to the backlash that we\u2019re experiencing nationwide. When you get down to it, inclusion isn\u2019t about the \u201cwarm and fuzzies.\u201d It\u2019s about creating an environment in which every team member can fully contribute. It\u2019s what happens in meetings when managers support team members, and when coworkers collaborate. It\u2019s about brainstorming, decision-making, designing, serving customers, working with suppliers, and planning. There\u2019s nothing more central to the bottom line or the employee experience.",
    "Too often, DEI programming and policy have focused on the negative. Some forms of DEI divide people, pitting one group against another. Stop saying this. Get rid of that. Don\u2019t be biased. That puts people on their heels and can make them so worried about saying or doing the wrong thing that they disengage or get mad and push back. Ironically, these types of DEI efforts can undermine inclusion and detract from organizational goals.",
    "There\u2019s a better way. Exemplary DEI efforts bring people together around the common purpose at hand \u2014 building a great product or service, growing a company. Of course, it\u2019s important to identify and curb negative or biased behaviors. But sometimes that\u2019s best done by bringing people together in positive ways. The most effective DEI efforts are tightly coupled with the mission of the organization. They support individual employees as they work toward shared goals. And one of the most effective ways to do that, our research shows, is to focus on micro-inclusions \u2014 small but intentional acts that include everyone in the actual process of producing work together. That involves supporting growth, listening, honoring contributions, and working respectfully through challenges. It maximizes team effectiveness, by allowing everyone to contribute and feel acknowledged, recognized, and appreciated. That\u2019s what fosters a sense of belonging and respect within a group. And it\u2019s what makes teams and companies succeed.",
    "In this article, we\u2019ll first summarize some of our recent research on the effects of micro-inclusions. Then we\u2019ll offer some guidance on how you can foster a culture of micro-inclusion in your organization.",
    "The Power of Micro-inclusions",
    "We recently conducted a large experiment with 897 employees of a Silicon Valley technology company. The study showed just how much of an impact micro-inclusions can have.",
    "In the experiment, we started by asking participants to imagine being part of a work group but didn\u2019t describe any interpersonal interaction that might take place in the group. We then measured the sense of belonging and fit people anticipated in that group (how respected and valued they would feel, whether they could see a future at the company). Women in this situation anticipated experiencing a lower sense of belonging and fit than men.",
    "We then asked participants to imagine being part of two other work groups, but now we described interpersonal interactions. In the second group, we described micro-exclusions, noting that the manager interrupted the employee when they were trying to share ideas, and then later articulated the ideas as if they were their own. Compared to the neutral group, both men and women felt worse when imagining being a part of this work group, and women still felt less belonging and fit than men.",
    "In the third group, we asked participants to imagine being part of a work group characterized by micro-inclusions \u2014 a manager solicited and supported the employees\u2019 ideas and showcased opportunities to contribute. Now both men and women anticipated feeling a heightened sense of belonging and fit. Women benefited most. Compared to the neutral group, women\u2019s belonging and fit increased by 35%, and men\u2019s by 23%. That gain eliminated the gender inequality. Women told us more than men that they would be surprised to find themselves in a work group of this sort. Everyone wants to feel included in contributing at work, but at least at this tech company, women didn\u2019t feel they could count on it.",
    "So micro-inclusions boost a sense of inclusion and belonging, especially for women. But would friendliness do the same thing? We didn\u2019t think so, but to find out, we ran another experiment, involving 427 women professionals in science, technology, and related fields. When we asked participants to imagine being part of a work group with micro-inclusions, we found that the gain they experienced in their belonging and fit (when compared to neutral treatment) was up to four\u00a0times greater than the gain they experienced when the work group just came together warmly for a happy hour. Women also reported a 37% bump in their commitment to the company and a 27% bump in their self-confidence in doing their job well after imagining the micro-inclusion work group, compared to only a 10% increase in company commitment and a 3% decrease in self-confidence after imagining the warm happy hour. Friendliness just isn\u2019t enough, because it doesn\u2019t include a person in the actual work \u2014 which, after all, is why you\u2019re in the workplace.",
    "How to Create a Culture of Micro-inclusion",
    "Here are some practical tips for coworkers, managers, and leaders on how to build a culture of micro-inclusion in the workplace.",
    "If you\u2019re a coworker, focus on micro-inclusions with your teammates by doing the following:",
    "Pull in different perspectives. Turn to someone who doesn\u2019t get to share as much as others, even though they have relevant expertise, and create space for them to contribute. Ask them specific questions on how they would approach the task at hand.",
    "Share resources and ideas. Explicitly normalize the challenges of starting a new role or project by sharing your own experiences and struggles with newer teammates and by offering tips or resources that helped you when you started out. Help junior or newer teammates get up-to-speed by providing historical project documents or tools to learn needed skills so they can contribute effectively.",
    "Circle back and make space during meetings. Invite contributions first from more junior and/or remote teammates for their perspective. Intentionally create space for those people to chime in throughout the meeting, not just at the beginning or end. If someone hasn\u2019t spoken yet, invite them to, but set a norm that \u201cnothing else to add\u201d is an acceptable response, so nobody feels put on the spot. If someone is interrupted, go back to them so that they can finish their contribution.",
    "If you\u2019re a manager, in addition to the coworker strategies, focus on team dynamics:",
    "Evaluate your team dynamics. Who gets listened to or is sought out in meetings? Who gets assigned impactful projects? Who gets celebrated? Who is supported in their growth? How can you broaden your team dynamics, so everyone is included?",
    "Let others contribute first. Communicate your eagerness to learn and listen, and invite others to speak before you do.",
    "Solicit additional perspectives. Ask \u201cWhat are we missing here?\u201d to invite perspectives that may differ from your own or that of others who have already spoken. Take the feedback seriously and facilitate a group process that integrates diverse perspectives.",
    "Facilitate specific opportunities to support and recognize contributions. There are many ways to do this. You might ask team members if they\u2019re looking for new opportunities or stretch projects and recommend them if such opportunities arise. During the middle and end of a project, make \u201cinvisible\u201d contributions visible by asking each team member to recognize someone else in the group for something they\u2019ve done that has contributed to the team\u2019s progress. That\u2019s a great practice in youth sports, but it\u2019s good for working professionals too. Make a point of recognizing and celebrating the many contributions along a project journey \u2014 and the diverse roles required for that journey to succeed. Solicit feedback from team members about their personal experiences, barriers they\u2019ve faced to fully contributing to the team, and whether you can help them overcome those barriers.",
    "If you\u2019re a leader, in addition to the coworker and manager strategies, you can influence the overall culture at your organization, as well as assessment related to micro-inclusions:",
    "Set a micro-inclusion vision for how your teams work together. Intentionally discuss with other leaders and with managers the value of a culture that solicits full contributions from all employees. Identify barriers to these contributions (How do teams work together cross-functionally? How do the organization\u2019s core values support or not support a micro-inclusive culture?) and work to help everyone overcome them.",
    "Assess progress. Track progress with organization-wide surveys and focus group data. Measure employee sentiment around sense of belonging and fit, commitment, and opportunities to contribute. Look for and take action to mitigate meaningful discrepancies between groups (in demographics, functions, and teams, for example).",
    "Our experiments suggest that when employees report low belonging and fit at work, that might mean they\u2019re being blocked from contributing to their full potential. Those are missed opportunities and inefficiencies for organizations. But blaming people isn\u2019t the solution. Even if you could just remove negative experiences, that doesn\u2019t create positive ones. It\u2019s worth remembering that for years, researchers and youth leaders have reported to us that the most effective approach to help young people learn is to focus on the positive and build from strengths. That\u2019s exactly what micro-inclusions do for all of us at work.",
