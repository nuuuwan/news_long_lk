All too often, traditional DEI programming and policy have focused on how not to behave. This focus on the negative can make people so worried about saying or doing the wrong thing that they disengage or get mad and push back. In this article, the authors argue...more

It matters when employees have a strong sense of belonging, or feel like they fit at a company: They’re more engaged, innovative, and productive. To foster that kind of deep inclusion, companies often try to create a warm and welcoming culture, perhaps by supporting employee resource groups or sponsoring company events such as happy hours and team offsites. But it’s not the happy hour that inspires you at work — not really, not deeply, not in the best circumstances. What really matters is whether employees actually feel like they’re contributing to the work at hand.

We think the traditional approach to DEI is incomplete — and because it’s incomplete, we suspect it’s contributing to the backlash that we’re experiencing nationwide. When you get down to it, inclusion isn’t about the “warm and fuzzies.” It’s about creating an environment in which every team member can fully contribute. It’s what happens in meetings when managers support team members, and when coworkers collaborate. It’s about brainstorming, decision-making, designing, serving customers, working with suppliers, and planning. There’s nothing more central to the bottom line or the employee experience.

Too often, DEI programming and policy have focused on the negative. Some forms of DEI divide people, pitting one group against another. Stop saying this. Get rid of that. Don’t be biased. That puts people on their heels and can make them so worried about saying or doing the wrong thing that they disengage or get mad and push back. Ironically, these types of DEI efforts can undermine inclusion and detract from organizational goals.

There’s a better way. Exemplary DEI efforts bring people together around the common purpose at hand — building a great product or service, growing a company. Of course, it’s important to identify and curb negative or biased behaviors. But sometimes that’s best done by bringing people together in positive ways. The most effective DEI efforts are tightly coupled with the mission of the organization. They support individual employees as they work toward shared goals. And one of the most effective ways to do that, our research shows, is to focus on micro-inclusions — small but intentional acts that include everyone in the actual process of producing work together. That involves supporting growth, listening, honoring contributions, and working respectfully through challenges. It maximizes team effectiveness, by allowing everyone to contribute and feel acknowledged, recognized, and appreciated. That’s what fosters a sense of belonging and respect within a group. And it’s what makes teams and companies succeed.

In this article, we’ll first summarize some of our recent research on the effects of micro-inclusions. Then we’ll offer some guidance on how you can foster a culture of micro-inclusion in your organization.

The Power of Micro-inclusions

We recently conducted a large experiment with 897 employees of a Silicon Valley technology company. The study showed just how much of an impact micro-inclusions can have.

In the experiment, we started by asking participants to imagine being part of a work group but didn’t describe any interpersonal interaction that might take place in the group. We then measured the sense of belonging and fit people anticipated in that group (how respected and valued they would feel, whether they could see a future at the company). Women in this situation anticipated experiencing a lower sense of belonging and fit than men.

We then asked participants to imagine being part of two other work groups, but now we described interpersonal interactions. In the second group, we described micro-exclusions, noting that the manager interrupted the employee when they were trying to share ideas, and then later articulated the ideas as if they were their own. Compared to the neutral group, both men and women felt worse when imagining being a part of this work group, and women still felt less belonging and fit than men.

In the third group, we asked participants to imagine being part of a work group characterized by micro-inclusions — a manager solicited and supported the employees’ ideas and showcased opportunities to contribute. Now both men and women anticipated feeling a heightened sense of belonging and fit. Women benefited most. Compared to the neutral group, women’s belonging and fit increased by 35%, and men’s by 23%. That gain eliminated the gender inequality. Women told us more than men that they would be surprised to find themselves in a work group of this sort. Everyone wants to feel included in contributing at work, but at least at this tech company, women didn’t feel they could count on it.

So micro-inclusions boost a sense of inclusion and belonging, especially for women. But would friendliness do the same thing? We didn’t think so, but to find out, we ran another experiment, involving 427 women professionals in science, technology, and related fields. When we asked participants to imagine being part of a work group with micro-inclusions, we found that the gain they experienced in their belonging and fit (when compared to neutral treatment) was up to four times greater than the gain they experienced when the work group just came together warmly for a happy hour. Women also reported a 37% bump in their commitment to the company and a 27% bump in their self-confidence in doing their job well after imagining the micro-inclusion work group, compared to only a 10% increase in company commitment and a 3% decrease in self-confidence after imagining the warm happy hour. Friendliness just isn’t enough, because it doesn’t include a person in the actual work — which, after all, is why you’re in the workplace.

How to Create a Culture of Micro-inclusion

Here are some practical tips for coworkers, managers, and leaders on how to build a culture of micro-inclusion in the workplace.

If you’re a coworker, focus on micro-inclusions with your teammates by doing the following:

Pull in different perspectives. Turn to someone who doesn’t get to share as much as others, even though they have relevant expertise, and create space for them to contribute. Ask them specific questions on how they would approach the task at hand.

Share resources and ideas. Explicitly normalize the challenges of starting a new role or project by sharing your own experiences and struggles with newer teammates and by offering tips or resources that helped you when you started out. Help junior or newer teammates get up-to-speed by providing historical project documents or tools to learn needed skills so they can contribute effectively.

Circle back and make space during meetings. Invite contributions first from more junior and/or remote teammates for their perspective. Intentionally create space for those people to chime in throughout the meeting, not just at the beginning or end. If someone hasn’t spoken yet, invite them to, but set a norm that “nothing else to add” is an acceptable response, so nobody feels put on the spot. If someone is interrupted, go back to them so that they can finish their contribution.

If you’re a manager, in addition to the coworker strategies, focus on team dynamics:

Evaluate your team dynamics. Who gets listened to or is sought out in meetings? Who gets assigned impactful projects? Who gets celebrated? Who is supported in their growth? How can you broaden your team dynamics, so everyone is included?

Let others contribute first. Communicate your eagerness to learn and listen, and invite others to speak before you do.

Solicit additional perspectives. Ask “What are we missing here?” to invite perspectives that may differ from your own or that of others who have already spoken. Take the feedback seriously and facilitate a group process that integrates diverse perspectives.

Facilitate specific opportunities to support and recognize contributions. There are many ways to do this. You might ask team members if they’re looking for new opportunities or stretch projects and recommend them if such opportunities arise. During the middle and end of a project, make “invisible” contributions visible by asking each team member to recognize someone else in the group for something they’ve done that has contributed to the team’s progress. That’s a great practice in youth sports, but it’s good for working professionals too. Make a point of recognizing and celebrating the many contributions along a project journey — and the diverse roles required for that journey to succeed. Solicit feedback from team members about their personal experiences, barriers they’ve faced to fully contributing to the team, and whether you can help them overcome those barriers.

If you’re a leader, in addition to the coworker and manager strategies, you can influence the overall culture at your organization, as well as assessment related to micro-inclusions:

Set a micro-inclusion vision for how your teams work together. Intentionally discuss with other leaders and with managers the value of a culture that solicits full contributions from all employees. Identify barriers to these contributions (How do teams work together cross-functionally? How do the organization’s core values support or not support a micro-inclusive culture?) and work to help everyone overcome them.

Assess progress. Track progress with organization-wide surveys and focus group data. Measure employee sentiment around sense of belonging and fit, commitment, and opportunities to contribute. Look for and take action to mitigate meaningful discrepancies between groups (in demographics, functions, and teams, for example).

Our experiments suggest that when employees report low belonging and fit at work, that might mean they’re being blocked from contributing to their full potential. Those are missed opportunities and inefficiencies for organizations. But blaming people isn’t the solution. Even if you could just remove negative experiences, that doesn’t create positive ones. It’s worth remembering that for years, researchers and youth leaders have reported to us that the most effective approach to help young people learn is to focus on the positive and build from strengths. That’s exactly what micro-inclusions do for all of us at work.
