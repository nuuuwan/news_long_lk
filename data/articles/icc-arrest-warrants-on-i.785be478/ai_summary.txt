International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor General Karim Khan has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and top Hamas leaders over war crimes in Gaza. This comes as the recognition of Palestine as an independent state ramps up, with recent support from Spain, Norway, and Ireland. The ICC action has been denounced by both Israeli leaders and Hamas. The piece highlights allegations that the world court tends to prosecute African and anti-West leaders while offering impunity to pro-Western nations. It also criticises the US for its staunch pro-Israel stance, with President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken reportedly dismissing the ICCâ€™s move and the latter facing protests during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee appearance.
