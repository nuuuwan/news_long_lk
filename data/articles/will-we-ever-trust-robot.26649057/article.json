    "The world might seem to be on the brink of a humanoid-robot heyday. New breakthroughs in artificial intelligence promise the type of capable, general-purpose robots previously seen only in science fiction\u2014robots that can do things like assemble cars, care for patients, or tidy our homes, all without being given specialized instructions.\u00a0 It\u2019s an idea that has attracted an enormous amount of attention, capital, and optimism. Figure raised $675 million for its humanoid robot in 2024, less than two years after being founded. At a Tesla event this past October, the company\u2019s Optimus robots outshined the self-driving taxi that was meant to be the star of the show. Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, believes that these robots could somehow build \u201ca future where there is no poverty.\u201d One might think that supremely capable humanoids are just a few years away from populating our homes, war zones, workplaces, borders, schools, and hospitals to serve roles as varied as therapists, carpenters, home health aides, and soldiers.\u00a0  Yet recent progress has arguably been more about style than substance. Advancements in AI have undoubtedly made robots easier to train, but they have yet to enable them to truly sense their surroundings, \u201cthink\u201d of what to do next, and carry out those decisions in the way some viral videos might imply. In many of these demonstrations (including Tesla\u2019s), when a robot is pouring a drink or wiping down a counter, it is not acting autonomously, even if it appears to be. Instead, it is being controlled remotely by human operators, a technique roboticists refer to as teleoperation. The futuristic looks of such humanoids, which usually borrow from dystopian Hollywood sci-fi tropes like screens for faces, sharp eyes, and towering, metallic forms, suggest the robots are more capable than they often are. \u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re at peak hype,\u201d says Leila Takayama, a robotics expert and vice president of design and human\u00ad-robot interaction at the warehouse robotics company Robust AI. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an arms war\u2014or humanoids war\u2014between all the big tech companies to flex and show that they can do more and they can do better.\u201d As a result, she says, any roboticist not working on a humanoid has to answer to investors as to why. \u201cWe have to talk about them now, and we didn\u2019t have to a year ago,\u201d Takayama told me.",
    "Shariq Hashme, a former employee of both OpenAI and Scale AI, entered his robotics firm Prosper into this arms race in 2021. The company is developing a humanoid robot it calls Alfie to perform domestic tasks in homes, hospitals, and hotels. Prosper hopes to manufacture and sell Alfies for approximately $10,000 to $15,000 each.\u00a0  \u201cWhy are we enamored with this idea of building a replica of ourselves?\u201d Guy Hoffman, associate professor, Cornell University In conceiving the design for Alfie, Hashme identified trustworthiness as the factor that should trump all other considerations, and the top challenge that needs to be overcome to see humanoids benefit society. Hashme believes one essential tactic to get people to put their trust in Alfie is to build a detailed character from the ground up\u2014something humanlike but not too human.",
    "This is about more than just Alfie\u2019s appearance. Hashme and his colleagues are envisioning the way the robot moves and signals what he\u2019ll do next; imagining desires and flaws that shape his approach to tasks; and crafting an internal code of ethics that governs the instructions he will and will not accept from his owners.\u00a0\u00a0 In some ways, leaning so heavily on the principle of trustworthiness for Alfie feels premature; Prosper has raised a tiny amount of capital compared with giants like Tesla or Figure and is months (or years) away from shipping a product. But the need to tackle the issue of trustworthiness head-on and early reflects the messy moment humanoids are in: Despite all the investment and research, few people would feel warm and comfortable with such a robot if it walked into their living room right now. We\u2019d wonder what data it was recording about us and our surroundings, fear it might someday take our job, or be turned off by its way of moving; rather than elegant and useful, humanoids are often cumbersome and creepy. Overcoming that lack of trust will be the first hurdle to clear before humanoids can live up to their hype. Related StoryA skeptic\u2019s guide to humanoid-robot videosThe right video can land a startup millions in investment and a devoted public following. But what do these videos really show?",
    "But on the road to helping Alfie win our trust, one question looms larger than any other: How much will he be able to do on his own? How much will he still rely on humans? New AI techniques have made it faster to train robots through demonstration data\u2014usually some combination of images, videos, and other data created by humans doing tasks like washing dishes while wearing sensors that pick up on their movements. This data can then coach robots through those tasks much the way that a large body of text can help a large language model create sentences. Still, this method requires lots of data, and lots of humans need to step in and correct for errors.  Hashme told me that he expects the first release of Alfie to handle only about 20% of tasks on his own. The rest will be assisted by a Prosper team of \u201cremote assistants,\u201d at least some of them based in the Philippines, who will have the ability to remotely control Alfie\u2019s movements. When I raised, among other concerns, whether it\u2019s viable for a robotics business to rely on manual human labor for so many tasks, Hashme pointed to the successes of Scale AI. That company, which processes training data for AI applications, has a significant workforce in the Philippines\u2014and is often criticized for its labor practices. Hashme was one of the people managing that workforce for about a year before founding Prosper. His departure from Scale AI was itself set off by a violation of trust\u2014one for which he would serve time in federal prison. The success or failure of Alfie will reveal much about society\u2019s willingness to welcome humanoid robots into our private spaces. Can we accept a profoundly new and asymmetric labor arrangement in which workers in low-wage countries use robotic interfaces to perform physical tasks for us at home? Will we trust them to safeguard private data and images of us and our families? On the most basic level, will the robots even be useful?  To address some of these concerns around trust, Hashme brought in Buck Lewis. Two decades before Lewis worked with robots, before he was charged with designing a humanoid that people would trust rather than fear, the challenge in front of him was a rat.\u00a0 In 2001, Lewis was a revered animator and one of the top minds at Pixar. His specialty was designing characters with deep, universal appeal, a top concern to studios that fund high-\u00adbudget projects aimed at capturing audiences worldwide. It was a niche that had led Lewis to bring trucks and sedans to life in the movie Cars and create characters for many DreamWorks and Disney films. But when Jan Pinkava, the creative force behind Ratatouille, told Lewis about his pitch for that film\u2014the story of a rat who wants to be a chef\u2014the task felt insurmountable. Rats evoke such fear and apprehension in humans that their very name has become a shorthand for someone who cannot be trusted. How could Lewis turn a maligned rodent into an endearing chef? \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply ingrained aversion, because rats are horrifying,\u201d he told me. \u201cFor this to work, we had to create a character that rewires people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d",
    "To do that, Lewis spent a lot of time in his head, imagining scenes like a group of rats hosting a playful pop-up dinner on a sidewalk in Paris. The result was Remy, a Parisian rat who not only rose through the culinary ranks in Ratatouille but was so lovable that demand for pet rats surged globally after the film\u2019s release in 2007.\u00a0 Two decades later, Lewis has made a career change and is now in charge of crafting every aspect of Alfie\u2019s character at Prosper. Much as the appealing Remy rebranded rats, Alfie represents Lewis\u2019s attempt to change the image of humanoid robots, from futuristic and dangerous to helpful and trustworthy. Prosper\u2019s approach reflects a foundational robotics concept articulated by Rodney Brooks, a founder of iRobot, which created the Roomba: \u201cThe visual appearance of a robot makes a promise about what it can do and how smart it is. It needs to deliver or slightly overdeliver on that promise or it will not be accepted.\u201d\u00a0 According to this principle, any humanoid robot makes the promise that it can behave like a human\u2014which is an exceedingly high bar. So high, in fact, that some firms reject it. Some humanoid-skeptic roboticists doubt that a helpful robot needs to resemble a human at all when it could instead accomplish practical tasks without being anthropomorphized.\u00a0  \u201cWhy are we enamored with this idea of building a replica of ourselves?\u201d asks Guy Hoffman, a roboticist focused on human\u00ad-robot interactions and an associate professor at Cornell University\u2019s engineering school.\u00a0  Early prototypes of Prosper\u2019s robotic butler, which could perform household tasks like cleaning a kitchen table, rinsing dishes, and discarding trash.DAVID VINTINER   The chief argument for robots with human characteristics is a functional one: Our homes and workplaces were built by and for humans, so a robot with a humanlike form will navigate them more easily. But Hoffman believes there\u2019s another reason: \u201cThrough this kind of humanoid design, we are selling a story about this robot that it is in some way equivalent to us or to the things that we can do.\u201d In other words, build a robot that looks like a human, and people will assume it\u2019s as capable as one.\u00a0 In designing Alfie\u2019s physical appearance, Prosper has borrowed some aspects of typical humanoid design but rejected others. Alfie has wheels instead of legs, for example, as bipedal robots are currently less stable in home environments, but he does have arms and a head. The robot will be built on a vertical column that resembles a torso; his specific height and weight are not yet public. He will have two emergency stop buttons.\u00a0 Nothing about Alfie\u2019s design will attempt to obscure the fact that he is a robot, Lewis says. \u201cThe antithesis [of trustworthiness] would be designing a robot that\u2019s intended to emulate a human \u2026 and its measure of success is based on how well it has deceived you,\u201d he told me. \u201cLike, \u2018Wow, I was talking to that thing for five minutes and I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s a robot.\u2019 That, to me, is dishonest.\u201d",
    "But much other humanoid innovation is headed in a direction where deception seems to be an increasingly attractive concept. In 2023, several ultrarealistic humanoid robots appeared in the crowd at an NFL game at SoFi stadium in California; after a video of them went viral, Disney revealed they were actually just people in suits, a stunt to promote a movie. Nine months later, researchers from the University of Tokyo unveiled a way to attach engineered skin, which used human cells, over the face of a robot in an attempt to more perfectly resemble a human face.\u00a0  \u201cThrough this kind of humanoid design, we are selling a story [that this robot] is in some way equivalent to us or to the things that we can do.\u201d Guy Hoffman, roboticist Lewis has considered much more than just Alfie\u2019s appearance. He and Prosper envision Alfie as an ambassador from a future civilization in which robots have incorporated the best qualities of humanity. He\u2019s not young or old but has the wisdom of middle age, and his primary function in life is to be of service to people on their terms. Like any compelling character, Alfie has flaws people can relate to\u2014he wishes he could be faster, and he tends to be a bit obsessive about finishing the tasks asked of him. Core tenets of Alfie\u2019s service are to respect boundaries, to be discreet and nonjudgmental, and to earn trust.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s an entity that\u2019s nonhuman, but he has a sort of sentience,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid looking at it as directly comparable to human consciousness.\u201d I\u2019ve been referring to Alfie as \u201che\u201d\u2014at the risk of over-\u00adanthropomorphizing what is currently a robot in development\u2014because Lewis pictures him as a gendered male. When I asked why he pictures Alfie as having a gender, he said it\u2019s probably a relic from the archetypal male butlers he saw on television shows like Batman growing up. But in a conversation with Hashme, I learned there is actually a real-life butler who is in some ways serving as an inspiration for Alfie.   That would be Fitzgerald Heslop. Heslop has decades of experience in high-end hospitality training, and for seven years he was the only person within the United States Department of Defense qualified to train household managers who would run the homes of three- and four-star generals. Heslop now runs the household of a wealthy family in the Middle East (he declined to get more specific) and has been contracted by Prosper to inform Alfie\u2019s approach to service within the home.\u00a0 Shortly into my conversation with Heslop, he elaborated on what excellent service looks like. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of creativity the good butler deals in: the making of beautiful moments to put people at their ease and increase their pleasure,\u201d he said, quoting Steven M. Ferry\u2019s book Butlers & Household Managers: 21st Century Professionals. He spoke with conviction about the impact great service can have on the world and about how protocol and etiquette can level the egos of even top dignitaries. Citing a quote often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, he said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\u201d Though he has no experience in robotics, Heslop is drawn to the idea that household robots could someday provide impeccable levels of service, and he thinks that Prosper has identified the right priorities to get there. \u201cPrivacy and discretion, attention to detail, and meticulous eyes for that are mission critical to the overall objective of the company,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd more importantly, in this case, Alfie.\u201d Related StoryResearchers taught robots to run. Now they\u2019re teaching them to walkRobots might need to become more boring to be useful.",
    "It is one thing to dream up an Alfie in sketchbooks, and another to build him. In the real world, the first version of Alfie will depend on remote assistants, mostly working abroad, to handle approximately 80% of its household tasks. These assistants will use interfaces not unlike video-game controllers to control Alfie\u2019s movements, relying on data from his sensors and cameras to guide them in washing dishes or clearing a table.",
    "Hashme says efforts are being made to conceal or anonymize personally revealing data while the robot is being teleoperated. That will include steps like removing sensitive objects and people\u2019s faces from recordings and allowing users to delete any footage they like. Ideally, Hashme wrote in an email, Alfie \u201cwill often simply look away from any potentially private activities.\u201d The AI industry has an appalling track record when it comes to workers in low-wage countries performing the hidden labor required to build cutting-edge models. Workers in Kenya were reportedly paid less than $2 an hour to manually purge toxic training data, including content describing child sexual abuse and torture, for OpenAI. Scale AI\u2019s own operation in the Philippines, which Hashme helped manage, was criticized in 2023 by rights groups for not abiding by basic labor standards and failing to pay workers properly and on time, according to an investigation by the Washington Post.\u00a0 In a statement, OpenAI said such work \u201cneeds to be done humanely and willingly,\u201d and that the company establishes \u201cethical and wellness standards for our data annotators.\u201d In a response to questions about criticisms of its operation in the Philippines, Scale AI wrote, \u201cOver the past year alone, we\u2019ve paid out hundreds of millions in earnings to contributors, giving people flexible work options and economic opportunity,\u201d and that \u201c98% of support tickets regarding pay have been successfully resolved.\u201d Hashme says he was not aware of the allegations against Scale\u00a0AI during his time there, which ended in 2019. But, he said in an email, \u201cwe did make mistakes, which we quickly corrected and generally took quite seriously.\u201d I asked him what lessons he takes from the allegations against Scale AI and other companies outsourcing sensitive data work and what safeguards he\u2019s putting in place for the team he\u2019s building in the Philippines for Prosper, which so far numbers about 10 people.",
    "Shariq Hashme, a former employee of both OpenAI and Scale AI, entered his robotics firm Prosper into the humanoid arms race in 2021.DAVID VINTINER   \u201cA lot of companies that do that kind of stuff end up doing it in a way which is kind of shitty for the people who are being employed,\u201d Hashme told me. Such companies often outsource important HR activities to untrustworthy partners abroad or lose workers\u2019 trust through bad incentive programs, he said, adding: \u201cWith a more experienced and closely managed team, and a lot more transparency around the entire system, I expect we\u2019ll be able to do a much better job.\u201d It\u2019s worth disclosing the nature of Hashme\u2019s departure from Scale AI, where he was hired in 2017 as its 14th employee. In May 2019, according to court documents, Scale noticed that someone had repeatedly withdrawn unauthorized payments of $140 and transferred them to multiple PayPal accounts. The company contacted the FBI. Over the course of five months, approximately $56,000 was taken from the company. An investigation revealed that Hashme, then 26, was behind the withdrawals, and in October of that year, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\u00a0Ahead of his sentencing, Alexandr Wang, the now-billionaire founder and CEO of Scale AI, wrote a letter to the judge in support of Hashme, as did 13 other current or former Scale employees. \u201cI believe Shariq is genuinely remorseful for his crime, and I have no reason to believe he will ever do something like this again,\u201d Wang wrote, and he said the company would not have wanted the wrongdoer prosecuted if it had known it was Hashme.\u00a0 Hashme lost his job, his stock options, and Scale\u2019s sponsorship of his green card application. Scale offered him a $10,000 severance payment before leaving, which he declined to accept, according to Wang\u2019s letter. Hashme paid the money back in 2019, and in February 2020, he was sentenced to three months in federal prison, which he served. Wang is now a primary investor in Prosper Robotics, alongside Ben Mann (cofounder of Anthropic), Simon Last (cofounder of Notion), and Debo Olaosebikan (cofounder and CEO of Kepler Computing).\u00a0 \u201cI had a major lapse in judgment when I was younger. I was facing some personal challenges and stole from my employer. The consequences and the realization of what I\u2019d done came as a shock, and led to a lot of soul-searching,\u201d Hashme wrote in an email in response to questions about the crime. At Prosper, he wrote, \u201cwe\u2019re taking trustworthiness as our highest aspiration.\u201d  There are some real upsides to being able to control robots remotely, but the idea of large-scale robotic teleoperation by overseas workers, even if it takes years for it to be effective, would be nothing short of a seismic shift for labor. It would present the possibility that even highly localized physical work that we perceive as immune to moving offshore\u2014cleaning hotel rooms or caring for hospital patients\u2014might someday be conducted by workers abroad. It also seems antithetical to the very idea of a trustworthy robot, since the machine\u2019s effectiveness would be inextricably tied to a faceless worker in another country, most likely receiving paltry wages.\u00a0 Hashme has spoken about using a portion of Prosper\u2019s profits to make direct payments to people whose jobs have been affected or replaced by Alfies, but he doesn\u2019t have specifics on how that would work. He\u2019s also still thinking through issues related to who or what Prosper\u2019s customers should be trusting when they allow its robot into their home.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to have to place as much trust in the company or the people the company hires,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d rather you place trust in the device, and the device is the robot, and the robot is making sure the company doesn\u2019t do something they\u2019re not supposed to do.\u201d\u00a0 He admits that the first version of Alfie will likely not live up to his highest aspirations, but he remains steadfast that the robot can be of service to society and to people, if only they can trust him.\u00a0 hide"
