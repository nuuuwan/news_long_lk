The traditional approach to mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which focuses on economies of scale and cost consolidation, is no longer as effective in today's volatile business landscape. Instead, companies are increasingly using M&A as a strategy for transformative growth. To succeed, leaders need to adopt a flexible mindset and an agile approach, allowing them to navigate and adapt to a dynamic landscape. Instead of following static playbooks, they should be prepared to pivot as needed, embrace uncertainty, and focus on integrating their operations in agile ways. This approach can help unlock the potential for transformative results that M&A can offer.
