    "The colossal wave of downsizing in the last few years is dividing the workplace in two, between the leavers and the survivors. Business has traditionally emphasized the consequences of downsizing on the leavers, sometimes putting in place severance pay, outplacement programs, and extended health benefits to ease their transition. However, the negative impacts of change are frequently felt just as strongly by those who remain following major layoffs. If you\u2019re a layoff survivor, how can you regain a sense of control over your work life? Once you have a solid understanding of the challenges you\u2019re facing, you can take steps to navigate your new work situation with clarity and confidence.",
