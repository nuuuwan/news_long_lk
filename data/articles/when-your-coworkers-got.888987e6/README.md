The colossal wave of downsizing in the last few years is dividing the workplace in two, between the leavers and the survivors. Business has traditionally emphasized the consequences of downsizing on the leavers, sometimes putting in place severance pay, outplacement programs, and extended health benefits to ease their transition.

Once you have a solid understanding of the challenges you’re facing, you can take steps to navigate your new work situation with clarity and confidence.
