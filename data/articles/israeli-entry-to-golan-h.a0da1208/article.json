    "What\u2019s happened?Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lambasted the movement of Israel\u2019s military into the Golan Heights demilitarised zone (a buffer strip straddling the Israeli-Syrian border), following\u00a0the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Israel claims that it was a necessary and temporary manoeuvre to prevent hostile forces from occupying positions abandoned by the now-defunct Syrian army. Egypt claims that advances into Syria\u2019s side of the Golan Heights violate a 1974 armistice that ended the Yom Kippur war\u2014in which Egypt fought\u2014and has demanded that the UN\u00a0Security Council act. The UN, which monitors the buffer strip, has similarly expressed grave\u00a0concerns.Why does it matter?The occupation of the Golan Heights has urgent significance for Egypt, as Israel has also taken control of a small area of territory within the Philadelphi corridor in Gaza that borders Egypt, in contravention of a 2005 accord. Egypt is\u00a0anxious\u00a0that the Israel-Hizbullah war and rapid regime change in Syria should not divert international attention away from the Gaza border issue, possibly for good as Israel\u2019s war with Hamas slowly winds down. Besides the possibility of mishaps between Israeli and Egyptian forces along the border\u2014there have already been instances of live fire being exchanged\u2014Egypt\u2019s\u00a0ultimate fear\u00a0is that Israel will open the border to refugees, leading to an influx of Palestinians who would need to be resettled in the Sinai.\u00a0By focusing the international community\u2019s mind on the Golan Heights in Syria, Egypt might hope to loop the conversation back to Israel\u2019s occupation in Gaza.Relations between Israel and Egypt are at an all-time low since the two established peace in 1979, owing to Egypt\u2019s frustration with Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza. However, realpolitik will keep Israeli-Egyptian ties alive.\u00a0Egypt wants a role in the political reconstruction with Gaza and also wishes to avoid rupturing important ties with the US, which supplies military aid and concessional finance. To a lesser extent, Egypt\u2019s need for Israeli natural gas is also a factor. The moment for Egypt to fully sever ties with Israel has already passed, in our view, barring major unforeseen regional tensions developing. Taking aim at Israel over the Golan Heights also helps to appease an anti-Israeli domestic audience without a realistic prospect of Egypt incurring diplomatic damage.What next?Egypt will continue to regard Israel\u2019s presence across the Gaza border as a foreign policy priority, but its scope to force a withdrawal is limited, especially as plans for what comes after the war with Hamas concludes remain at an embryonic stage.\u00a0We also expect Israel to be under less pressure than now after Donald Trump assumes the presidency of the US in January.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from\u00a0EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
