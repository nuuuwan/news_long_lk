# Gen AI is Coming for Remote Workers First

## Summary 🤖

1. 🏭 Automation has typically impacted blue-collar jobs first, but white-collar jobs saw gains, especially with the advent of remote work due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

2. 💻 The shift to remote work has made these jobs more susceptible to automation, as the tasks are digital and can be easily automated.

3. 📈 These changes could lead to considerable productivity benefits, as a result of automation.

4. 🤖 Generative AI is a significant driver of these current changes, potentially automating tasks at a higher rate than expected. 

5. 🧩 Three factors set to drive these changes are ease of use, firms being prepared for AI automation, and increasing AI autonomy. 

6. 📉 Some remote workers may lose their jobs as a result of these changes.

7. 🔄 Others may experience extensive changes in their job roles which will require them to reskill and adapt. 

8. 📚 Specific skills required will likely be focused on management and AI-specific abilities in order to maintain productivity. 

9. 🏢 The history of automation shows it typically impacting manufacturing and trade jobs, forcing workers to adapt or see their roles diminished. 

10. 👩‍💼 Similarly, the advent of technology like networked PCs saw a shift in administrative roles from human interaction to filling out software forms, often resulting in lower pay and less skill building.

Automation has historically impacted blue-collar jobs first, whereas white-collar jobs benefited. The wave of remote work brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic further empowered white-collar workers with more autonomy through remote work. However, generative AI is changing this narrative. Remote workers are now more susceptible to automation due to their tasks being digital and thus more easily automated, but also indicates large potential productivity benefits. But three larger forces are going to drive far more extensive gen AI automation than most expect: ease of use, firms have self-primed for gen AI automation, and growing gen AI autonomy. This means that while some remote workers will lose their jobs, many, many millions of them will soon experience extensive job change that will require reskilling, particularly in management and AI-specific skills, to adapt to the changing job landscape and maintain productivity.

There’s a tidy story out there when it comes to automation: If anyone felt its bite, it was workers in manufacturing and trade jobs first. The advent of the mechanized loom pushed weavers who worked for themselves into factories. After Ford trotted out the assembly line, skilled mechanics and engineers had to learn to go through rote motions. Eventually, support staff in offices experienced a similar fate. When networked PCs arrived, clerical and administrative workers saw their jobs shift from interacting with people to filling out software forms and checking boxes. All too many of them paid less. All too many build fewer skills. All too many treated with less variety, human connection, and dignity.
