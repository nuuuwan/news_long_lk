McDonald's is losing customers in the US because its pricing has become too high for many consumers. Those earning $45,000 or less are increasingly struggling to afford eating out. Despite this, McDonald's shares are thriving, mainly due to the company's successful real estate business model, wherein the company owns the land on which its outlets are based and rents it to franchise owners. Even as outlet owners experience a decrease in profits due to reduced custom, they must still maintain their outlets and pay rent to McDonald's. 

Many Americans are also struggling to buy cars, with a compact car now costing as much as what millions earn per year. As a result, more people are relying on public transportation, causing more demand for bus services and leading to an increase in poverty. In 2022, the official US poverty rate was 11.5%, with 37.9 million people in poverty. However, the Supplemental Poverty Measure revealed a rate of 12.4%, indicating that a significant portion of the US population is in financial hardship.
