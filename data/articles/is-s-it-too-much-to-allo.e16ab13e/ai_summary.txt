The Sri Lankan government has faced criticism for the arrest and later release of Tamil civilians in Trincomalee who were eating traditional rice porridge, known as 'kanji', in public to mark the anniversary of the end of the island's ethnic conflict. Such remembrance actions were allowed during the presidency of Maithripala Sirisena, but authorities have argued that the practise could spark discord and constitute a call for the revival of the rebel Tamil Tigers, known as the LTTE. Prior to their defeat in 2006, many Tamils subsisted on 'kanji'. The act served to increase discontent rather than achieve its intended aim of maintaining public order.
