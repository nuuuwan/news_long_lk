In the era of remote work and scattered teams, managers face a key challenge: fostering connections among employees, no matter where they happen to be located.

To do this, managers sometimes turn to team-building activities. Sure, corporate team-building activities might provoke cringey eye rolls and groans (trust falls and virtual dance parties, anyone?), and they definitely have their fair share of skeptics. But studies show that nurturing our human need for belonging improves job performance and wellbeing. Employees with strong relationships at work are more creative and collaborative; they also experience less burnout and are more likely to stay with their organization.

Put simply: Well-designed team-building activities are essential tools that can foster meaningful relationships among colleagues, ultimately driving employee engagement and contributing to overall organizational success.

But which activities and practices would work best for your team? And how can you put them into action most effectively? We turned to three experts for advice: Connie Hadley, an organizational psychologist and professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business; Erica Keswin, a workplace strategist and the author of Rituals Roadmap: The Human Way to Transform Everyday Routines into Workplace Magic; and Mary Shapiro, a professor at Simmons College School of Management and the author of HBR Guide to Leading Teams.

Here are the team-building activities they’ve seen work in practice, as well as their recommendations for how to plan and execute activities to maximize their success.

Team-Building Activities for Remote Teams

When you manage a group of remote workers who rarely see each other in person, effective team building is harder, says Shapiro. “You have to be more intentional and design structured interactions that will create connection — even from a distance.” The key, she says, is tailoring exercises to fit your group’s size, sensibilities, and circumstances. Many of these remote team-building exercises can be adapted for hybrid and in-person teams, too.

1. Lead structured conversations.

The better your team members understand one another, the more effectively they will work together, according to Shapiro. She suggests holding structured conversations centered on team goals, company culture, and personal strengths. “Talk about the culture you want to create within the team and how it feels to work together. This encourages people to reflect on their needs and share expectations,” she says. If you don’t know where to start, try some well-established team-building exercises, such as:

The reflected-best-self exercise. This is a personal development tool created by researchers at the University of Michigan. It helps team members identify their strengths and talents by asking their coworkers to share stories about when they’ve been at their best. These narratives allow people to see the impact they’ve had on others. “It gives people positive reinforcement and affirmation” and contributes to stronger team bonds, says Shapiro.

The artifact exercise involves asking team members to come to a meeting prepared to talk about an accomplishment they’re proud of — personal or professional — and a physical object representing their achievement, such as a photo or medal. (It can be an everyday object.) During the meeting, each person shares their story in a veritable virtual show-and-tell and then hears reaction from colleagues about the knowledge, skills, abilities, and determination they showed. “It helps team members see that they work with talented and impressive people,” says Shapiro.

The impact-of-styles exercise requires team members to complete a personality or communication-style assessment, such as the DiSC. They then share results and talk about their preferences for leadership, communication, and other important aspects of teamwork. “Diagnostics remind team members that everyone’s behavior follows personal rules and that most often, people come from a place of good intentions,” says Shapiro.

2. Try out conversation cards.

Conversation cards designed for the workplace can encourage active participation from all team members, including newcomers or those who may be quieter or more reserved. The cards typically feature a range of questions from: What’s your favorite game and why? to What’s one thing about your childhood you wish you could change? Keep in mind that these ice-breaker games and discussions require trust and a sense of psychological safety, says Hadley. “When we’re being vulnerable and revealing parts of ourselves that might not always feel comfortable, it can be a remarkable bridge builder.”

3. Devote time for chat.

Reserving the first five or so minutes of every weekly meeting to casual conversation allows remote coworkers to get to know one another on a personal level and encourages virtual team bonding, says Hadley. Carving out time for these informal, unstructured interactions shows your team that you value camaraderie. It’s also a low-stakes, easy way to build a friendly, inclusive work culture. “It takes intentional effort, but online conversation can be as satisfying as in-person ones if you do them right,” she adds.

4. Harness virtual communication tools.

Encouraging your remote team members to take advantage of online communication and video conferencing platforms creates space for lighthearted conversations, jokes, emojis, and memes, says Hadley. These casual interactions on Slack, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams can mimic those silly, spontaneous water cooler moments that people miss in remote work environments, she adds. Virtual calls and video meetings are “a way to help people bond.”

5. Play a simulation game.

Team-building games are fun, interactive experiences that boost teamwork and creativity. Think beyond team-building bingo, DIY craft challenges, and virtual trivia. Instead, Shapiro recommends critical-thinking games that simulate an unusual problem, like surviving a moon crash or doing an Arctic expedition, as these situations provide an opportunity for the entire team to work together and harness their strategic thinking skills. What’s more, healthy competition can bring out different sides of people’s personality and promote creative teamwork. Shapiro also advises leading your team in a post-game debrief to identify ways to apply the problem-solving that they learned to their real-world collaboration.

6. Host a week-long in-person “team week.”

Reserving blocks of time for in-person gatherings is critical for cultivating and maintaining relationships on remote teams, according to Keswin. Team weeks can include simple team-building exercises, one-on-one meetings, focused project sprints, and even group yoga sessions if that’s your team’s vibe. These events help build positive memories, she adds. “Once you’ve developed these relationships and there’s a solid foundation of trust and understanding, returning to your next virtual meeting feels more seamless.”

Team-Building Activities for  Hybrid Teams

Making sure that both in-person and remote members of a hybrid team feel included and connected requires additional logistical effort and planning. “We can’t assume it’s going to happen,” says Keswin. “As the team leader, you need to prioritize it.” Here are some ideas for activities and practices that work well for hybrid teams.

1. Create fun rituals.

Shapiro recommends kicking off hybrid team meetings with lateral thinking exercises and puzzles. Spending just five or 10 minutes on these activities helps team members engage with each other in new and different ways and perhaps form new friendships and meaningful connections. These activities quickly become a team favorite, she says. “It also creates a ritual that people look forward to and encourages them to be at the next team meeting on time because they don’t want to miss it.”

2. Give your team customized swag.

Team-branded merch can be a subtle yet powerful way to boost unity and reinforce a sense of belonging, according to Hadley. “When you’re wearing the jersey, you feel like you’re part of a team.” Similarly, customized items such as coffee mugs create a tangible connection and shared identity between teammates — almost like a mission statement, no matter where they are located.

3. Share origin stories.

Inviting team members to share their personal origin stories creates understanding and connection among colleagues, according to Keswin. These narratives — where people can share as much or as little as they want — might cover why they joined the organization or how they chose their career. The process of delivering these short presentations can reveal shared interests and build bonds, Keswin adds. “Discovering similarities, such as hometowns or a common hobby, can forge deeper connections.”

4. Conduct regular pulse checks.

Using internal communication software or an employee engagement dashboard — a tool designed to do sentiment analysis of employees’ thoughts about their jobs, organizations, and teams — can be a good way to gauge energy levels as well as how team members feel about team dynamics. These systems often include short questionnaires with response options like face emojis or stop lights to represent emotions and current mood. This approach allows managers to identify potential issues and take action, which in turn nurtures a sense of team trust. “If you see too many frowning faces, you hold an emergency team meeting,” says Hadley. The key is to establish a consistent routine for these pulse checks as it reinforces the idea that your team’s input is valued. Importantly, she adds, “Don’t collect data if you’re not going to do anything about it.”

5. Attend a conference together.

Going to a conference or professional development workshop offers your team an opportunity for a shared experience. These team-building events break the monotony of day-to-day routines, spark conversations around industry topics, and strengthen professional relationships. “You’re learning new things, but you’re also bonding,” says Hadley.

Team-Building Activities for In-Person Teams

Even when colleagues work alongside each other every day (or most days), strengthening team bonds is essential for maintaining camaraderie, cohesion, and team spirit. Here are some sample team-building activities for in-person teams:

1. Treat people to lunch (on a recurring basis).

Sharing a meal with colleagues encourages a different, more relaxed mode of interaction, says Hadley. Providing lunch for your team on a semi-regular basis also sends an important message from the organization, she adds. “It says: We want to invest in this unscripted time for you to be together and enjoy each other’s company.”

2. Exchange expertise.

A rotating lunch-and-learn program where colleagues take turns teaching each other new topics promotes a deeper appreciation for each team member’s skills and experiences, says Hadley. For example, one colleague might present on artificial intelligence, while another could cover effective communication skills. Rotating presenters ensures that opportunities are shared equally, everyone has a chance to shine, and that people have the opportunity to learn new skills.

3. Tackle a physical, fun challenge together.

Physical challenges, like ropes courses, scavenger hunts, and obstacle races, build unity and trust by promoting teamwork, communication, and collective problem-solving. These outdoor activities come with potential drawbacks: they can be costly, time-consuming, and might not be everyone’s cup of tea. “Some people will be horrified at having to do them, so it’s hard to make them a requirement,” says Shapiro. She recommends considering alternative roles, such as a spotter or cheering squad member, for those who don’t want to directly take part.

4. Tackle a novel, creative challenge together.

Activities such as improv comedy workshops, escape room challenges, and cooking classes help boost employee morale, while also creating a sense of accomplishment among coworkers. Even those who are hesitant at first may find themselves drawn in, says Keswin. “We’ve all been in situations where we don’t want to do something, but then we laugh, feel the oxytocin release, and our stress levels go down.”

5. Do a community service project.

Community service activities, such as organizing a park clean-up or volunteering at a local food bank, create a shared sense of purpose among team members. These activities promote better team collaboration, empathy, and also improve employees’ perceptions of their company.

Spending time together in a new place, even for colleagues who see each other all the time in an office setting, can strengthen relationships and team dynamics. Shifting away from the daily grind during off-sites provides a refreshing break and also encourages team members to relax and connect on a deeper level. These retreats can combine team-building activities and targeted brainstorming sessions, allowing for both work and play. Importantly, off-sites also provide the opportunity for shared dining experiences. Mealtimes create a more relaxed, communal atmosphere, says Hadley. “People behave differently when gathered around the table with a knife and fork.”

How to Think About Team Building

The good news is that successful team building doesn’t have to mean an extravagant week-long retreat in some faraway destination (although some colleagues probably wouldn’t complain if it did). Even small-scale activities and initiatives can yield results, says Hadley. “Loneliness can be a deep-seated and entrenched problem, yet in the grand scheme of things, the solutions to it are often simple and inexpensive.”

That doesn’t mean you can settle for superficial shortcuts, however. Successful team-building demands careful planning, commitment, and a sincere interest in getting to know your team members. Your goal is to build a positive, inclusive team culture.

Take an intentional approach.

Be thoughtful about how you spend your team’s time and what you want to accomplish — especially if some colleagues have reservations about the notion of team building, notes Keswin.

“Even though a lot of people’s first reaction to these activities might be that they’re cheesy or a box to check, as a manager, you need to push through it,” she says. “In the post-pandemic era where many employees may see each other in person only once a week, a few times a month, or just a couple of times a year, there’s a renewed understanding of the need to be that much more intentional when we come together.”

Keswin advises scheduling activities during work hours to show respect for your team’s personal lives and work-life balance. This ensures that colleagues with caregiving needs or other obligations can fully participate and feel included.

Evaluate your team’s needs.

Identifying the best activities for your team requires taking into account your team’s size, location distribution, and your organization’s budget. Your choice of team-building activities will also depend on whether your team works remotely, in-person, or in a hybrid arrangement.

Our experts say that if your team members are mostly remote or geographically dispersed, it’s important to hold at least a couple of in-person activities each year so that colleagues meet face-to-face.

Organizations that are saving money by reducing office space should reinvest those resources in team-building activities, says Keswin. She points to research showing that in-person interactions help strengthen team connections. “Once you connect with someone in person, the tone and tenor of your virtual interactions are different and it’s easier to maintain relationships down the road.”

Include others in the planning.

Unsure which team-building activities will resonate with your colleagues? Ask them directly, suggests Shapiro. Involving team members in the planning process gets people on board and allows you to tailor activities to match your team’s mix of personalities and interests.

“Tapping into their perspectives also helps you better understand the team’s preferences,” she says. “Some people are more playful and open, while others might prefer keeping things strictly work-related.”

What’s more, your colleagues likely bring valuable feedback and experience to the table. “Some of your team members have worked in different organizations and might have insights about what’s effective based on their past experiences.”

Lay down ground rules.

Setting clear guidelines and principles for team-building activities helps manage expectations and ensures a well-organized experience, says Keswin.

These protocols and group norms could be as straightforward as taking regular breaks, ensuring everyone has a chance to speak, and being present with a moratorium on multitasking. The goal is to practice inclusivity, active listening, and focus.

Keswin also suggests instituting a no-smartphone policy during team-building activities. Forming relationships requires engagement. “Pardon the pun, but left to our own devices, we don’t connect,” she says.

Finally, as a manager, your genuine enthusiasm and commitment are vital. Lead by example, as your team members will take their cues from you. Pay attention to how you come across and avoid giving the impression that team-building activities are a distraction from work, says Hadley. No deep sighs; no tsking; and no negativity. “If you’re impatiently looking at your watch and making backhanded comments like, ‘Our agenda is going to be harder to get through now,’ it’s not going to work,” she says. “As the manager, you set the tone.”

Hopefully, these suggestions inspire ideas that you can tailor to your team’s size, sensibilities, and circumstances. Remember, these activities don’t need to be extravagant or overly structured. What matters is being intentional about making team building happen. Stay attentive to your team members’ needs, involve colleagues in planning, and show sincere interest in getting to know them. By doing so, you’ll help build a positive, inclusive team culture that tackles loneliness and helps everyone succeed together.
