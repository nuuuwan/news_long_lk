1. 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka's current public services pensions (PSP) system poses a heavy financial burden on the country due to its non-contributory nature, funded directly from government revenue. 
2. 💲 According to an IPS analysis, PSP payments in 2023 accounted for 7.9% of government’s recurring expenditure and 12.1% of its revenue.
3. 👥 This system affects about 700,000 public sector retirees and over 1.35 million public sector employees.
4. 📈 The total PSP pension payments rose by 20.5% in 2023 due to a net increase of 4.2% in pensioners.
5. 💸 Half of the PSP benefits, funded by taxpayers, go to the top 20% income bracket, revealing that the system is not pro-poor.
6. 🏦 About 44% of PSP beneficiaries belong to the wealthiest 20% of the population.
7. 💭 Questions are raised about the fairness of the government supporting social security for public sector workers, who represent 15% of the employed population and benefit from steady incomes. 
8. 🔄 To relieve this burden, the government has proposed a Contributory Pension Fund requiring contributions from employees and the government. 
9. 📈 The proposed contributory scheme would apply to individuals newly recruited, with the possibility for existing employees to switch voluntarily in a gradual transition. 
10. 🏢 Efficient management of pension funds, including adopting good investment management practices and transparent governing structures, is crucial for sustainability.
