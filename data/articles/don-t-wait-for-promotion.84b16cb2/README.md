Many managers only begin advocating for their employees when they’re afraid of losing them or when promotion cycles roll around. It’s a reactive approach, and it often comes too late, with managers scrambling to highlight their team members’ strengths only to compete with dozens of others doing the same. The role of a manager as an advocate goes far beyond checking boxes at promotion time. Advocacy is about continuously championing your team’s growth by recognizing their contributions, ensuring their efforts are relevant to the organization’s goals, and making their value visible to key stakeholders. Make advocacy an ongoing priority, and you’ll see the ripple effects: stronger engagement, higher performance, and a team ready to take on new challenges. In the process, you’ll elevate your own leadership brand, setting yourself apart as a manager who builds careers and drives results.

Aiko, a former client of mine and a high-potential marketing executive at a global organization, had a reputation that went beyond her role. Her team was known for its engagement, productivity, and, above all, growth, as her employees got promoted faster than most. People wanted to work for her — she even earned the nickname “Leader Maker.”
