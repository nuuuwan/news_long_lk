    "Many managers only begin advocating for their employees when they\u2019re afraid of losing them or when promotion cycles roll around. It\u2019s a reactive approach, and it often comes too late, with managers scrambling to highlight their team members\u2019 strengths only to compete with dozens of others doing the same. The role of a manager as an advocate goes far beyond checking boxes at promotion time. Advocacy is about continuously championing your team\u2019s growth by recognizing their contributions, ensuring their efforts are relevant to the organization\u2019s goals, and making their value visible to key stakeholders. Make advocacy an ongoing priority, and you\u2019ll see the ripple effects: stronger engagement, higher performance, and a team ready to take on new challenges. In the process, you\u2019ll elevate your own leadership brand, setting yourself apart as a manager who builds careers and drives results.",
