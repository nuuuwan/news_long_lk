While DEI has faced significant backlash in the last year, companies across industries are still looking for ways to build healthy, inclusive workplace cultures where everyone can do their best work. New data at shows that even during this year of backlash, companies continued to make progress on many of their DEI initiatives. There are three ways companies should consider shifting their approach to DEI, both to be responsive to the current moment and to achieve greater impact: resetting the narrative, using data more effectively, and moving from siloed efforts to an embedded organizational focus on creating cultures that work for everyone.

After a year of anti-diversity activism, the final months of 2024 have raised new questions about the future of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The incoming presidential administration has called dismantling DEI programs a day-one priority. Activists have filed dozens of lawsuits targeting DEI programs. A new “anti-woke” investment fund has launched with the goal of targeting companies with high-visibility DEI initiatives.
