It’s easy for organizations to get stuck in strategy myopia — prioritizing the urgent, the proven, and the easily measured — particularly in a moment of intense change. To avoid this, successful leaders follow five principles. First, they refuse false proxies, recognizing that...more

We’ve spent a century creating efficient organizations. We’ve created companies of scale that transform our economy and create wealth. Dozens of companies are now bigger than the economies of entire nations.  Optimization and smart management have turned products that were initially seen as novelties — the automobile, the telephone, or personal computers — into huge businesses. The essence of this forward motion is a focus on convenience and efficiency. Predictable, manageable efforts toward stability and profitability.

But polishing yesterday’s work isn’t useful if the world is in flux. When we focus on improving the efficiency of our current plan, we inevitably miss the opportunity to develop a new strategy in response to new conditions. At its peak, Yahoo could have easily bought Google, a search engine with a very different approach to the internet. They decided to put that money into further developing Yahoo Kids instead. And long before that, Western Union had the chance to buy the Bell telephone system, but chose to invest in making telegrams easier to use and cheaper to create.

These are only two examples of “strategy myopia,” which prioritizes the urgent, the proven, and the easily measured. It pushes us to execute reliable plans instead of embracing possibility.

In part this myopia comes from what we expect from a new strategy. Strategy is not a plan. A plan might come with a guarantee: “If we do this, we win.” A strategy, on the other hand, comes with the motto: “This might not work.” Strategy is a philosophy of becoming, a chance to create the conditions to enable the change we seek to make in the world.

When the boss demands a strategy that comes with certainty and proof, we’re likely to settle for a collection of chores, tasks, and tactics, which is not the same as an elegant, resilient strategy. To do strategy right, we need to lean into possibility.

It’s easy to get stuck in strategy myopia, especially in our current moment of intense technological change. To avoid this, I believe successful leaders follow these principles:

1. Refuse false proxies.

What transforms a project or new market into an industry? A combination of convenience and efficiency. Convenience helps us meet our existing customer’s obvious needs. Convenience puts the right item in the right place. And efficiency cuts costs, embraces automation, and gives management a tool for increasing profits.

However, new projects solving future problems are always less efficient than the status quo. Consider Amazon: During its early years, the company lost money on almost every book they shipped — because they were planting the seeds for the efficient industry they were betting would follow.

Leaders often prefer concrete metrics that are easy to measure and simple to compare, but a useful strategy almost always begins as both inconvenient and inefficient. Strategy is based on the insight that what’s challenging now will get easier over time.

Buying a car was a fraught investment when there were few paved roads and no easily accessed gas stations. But the pioneers of that industry bet that the infrastructure would follow, because the need for transportation was insatiable.

2. Choose your customers, choose your future.

Strategy myopia occurs when we fail to identify who we seek to serve, and focus on what we seek to produce instead. Empathy gives us a strategic advantage.

A tactical, short-term focus is based on the past. We can try to defend the machines and processes already in place, working to maximize the assets we’ve got. Or we can visualize the customer and serve their needs as the world changes.

Google’s own labs pioneered LLM artificial intelligence, but the company largely chose to defend their existing search product instead. Its competitors asked what people might want to do; Google thought it could insist that people continue to do what they wanted them to do.

Empathy begins with the humility to acknowledge that you don’t know what others know, want what they want, or believe what they believe … and that’s okay. If we’re not prepared to move to where our customers are hoping to go, it’s unlikely that they’ll care enough to adopt what we care about.

When Netflix shifted its strategy from DVDs to streaming, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos made a bold choice — they didn’t invite anyone from the DVD division to their meetings. Even though these folks accounted for 100% of the company’s profit, the company’s leaders knew that the compromises they would demand (to protect their core business) would cause the new strategy to fail.

You cannot compromise your way to an elegant strategy. Effective strategies come from tiny teams and insightful individuals, not committees. While it’s tempting to invite people with power on the org chart to sit with us as we develop our strategy, this myopic move will likely amplify the defense of sunk costs.

Instead, we can choose from a spectrum of attitudes and skills, specifically:

People who are skilled in practical empathy, eager to identify and amplify the needs of the audience you seek to serve. You don’t have to be a toddler to design a toy, or a cancer survivor to be an oncologist. But you do need to commit to see what others see and desire.

People who have demonstrated domain skills in what can be done, with a particular focus on folks who accomplish things that others say are impossible.

Individuals with a passion for game theory and scenario planning.

Successful project managers.

If strategy is a philosophy of becoming, we’re seeking people eager to build something that’s not there yet.

4. Big problems demand small solutions.

The successful but myopic organization wants to launch a new thing that is as polished and reliable as the core offering. But every industry began with an inefficient solution that just barely worked, serving just a few customers. The hard work is creating the conditions for progress, not in shipping perfection.

Twenty years ago, the early mass marketed milk substitutes were hardly delicious. That’s okay, they weren’t sold to people who wanted flavor, they were for people seeking an alternative. Over time, after hundreds of product generations, oat milk and almond milk are growing at double digit rates, almost certain to overtake milk before the end of the decade.

Find the smallest viable market, not the biggest possible one. If you can delight 500 people so much that they bring their friends along, the system will begin to change. We spend too much time in focus groups and feasibility studies, and not nearly enough time putting solutions into people’s hands.

Any company that waits until a new product category is proven and successful has let fear and the status quo cost them the future.

5. Insist on interesting questions, not correct answers.

To avoid strategic myopia, begin by looking for problems. Problems demand solutions, and solutions become projects, and then, eventually, projects become industries.

For example, pickleball is the answer to: What do older people want when they decide tennis is too hard to keep up with? Warby Parker is the answer to: How will a new generation buy eyeglasses? There are questions all around us, we’ll probably never run out of them.

The interesting questions usually start with systems and change agents.

Systems are often invisible, hiding behind culture. Systems occur when humans need interoperability, a chance to trade or transact or connect. And so we drive on this side of the road, not that side.

Systems fight to remain the same, but when technology or communication shifts, a change agent arrives. The change agent might be generational, or a new way to communicate, or a medical breakthrough. The change agent disrupts the system and creates new problems and opportunities.

A simple example: The car transformed transportation, which led to cultural shifts, one of which was the need for the out-of-town traveler to find a comfortable and sanitary place to eat dinner will on the road. A man named Duncan Hines began his brand by offering those travelers a guidebook, which evolved into a lodging referral service, and finally, convenient, safe, and well-priced food to eat at home.

His question was obvious in retrospect: “How will the car change the way people eat?” Asking the question opens the door to finding an answer.

An ongoing study of strategy implementation has repeatedly found that leaders typically spend less than one day a month working on and discussing the organization’s strategy. The likely reason: It’s easier to focus on plans and performance instead. Strategy feels soft, while there’s “real work” to be done right now.

But as many other strategy experts have warned over the years, if you’re going in the wrong direction, it doesn’t matter how fast you’re going.

Work on strategy today. You can always make plans tomorrow.
