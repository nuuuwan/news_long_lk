Thousands of Tamils gathered in Mullaivaikkal, Sri Lanka, on 18 May to commemorate those who died during the country's civil war, which ended in 2009. The region was a 'No Fire Zone' where civilians were trapped in the final battle. Attendees placed photographs in the ground and offered prayers. Four people were arrested earlier in the week when serving food in memorial of the event, and a court order cited 'public health' and 'terrorist activities' as the reasons. They were later released on bail. Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agn√®s Callamard, attended the event and called on the international community to ensure justice is served in Sri Lanka.
