An  elected chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha (divisional council) is shot dead by a lone gunman while meeting members of the public in his council office. The party to which he belongs protests strongly and calls the killing a political assassination. The cabinet minister in charge of public security makes light of the murder by alleging that the  victim was a  gangster with  a criminal past. He dismisses it as an underworld dispute.It is against this bizarre backdrop that this column focuses on the killing of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha chairman Lasantha Wickramasekara alias “Midigama Lasa” this week. Let me begin with a brief outline of the murder and it’s aftermath.

Two men arrived on a motor cycle at the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha office on the morning of 22 October 2025. Weligama is a coastal town in the Matara district of Sri Lanka’s southern province.It is about 144 km to the south of Colombo.

Oct 22  was a Wednesday known as public day. It is customary for the Pradeshiya Sabha’s elected  officials to meet with members of the public each Wednesday. Lasantha Wickramasekara the 38 year old chairman of the Weligama Pradeshiya sabha was  seated in his office  interacting with people since 9.30 am. Wickramasekara  also known as “Midigama Lasa”  was elected in the May 2025 Local authority elections from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB).

The two men who arrived on a motor cycle alighted from the vehicle. While one remained outside the  council,   the other went inside. He was dressed in white and wore a black health mask which covered the lower part of his face.  The man who  had a file with him, told  the people assembled  outside the chairman’s office that he had to get a document signed urgently by  the PS chairman  and  sought  permission to  jump the queue  and meet him  next.

Among those  outside the office were some men who were “unofficial” bodyguards of Lasantha Wickramasekara. None suspected anything and it was agreed that the man could go in next and get his letter signed. So when a woman  who had been conversing with the chairman came out, the man with the file went in quickly. It was 10.20 am.

Even as the   Weligama PS chairman looked up, the man in white with a black mask, whipped out a revolver concealed in the file and fired at Lasantha  Wickrtamasekara. He fired four times hitting Wickramasekara in the chest ,head and neck.  The PS chairman bleeding profusely was rushed to the Matara district general hospital 12 km away. While receiving medical treatment  at the Intensive Care Unit(ICU), Lasantha Wickramasekara succumbed to his injuries.He was married and the father of three children.

Meanwhile the gun toting assassin rushed outside where his companion  was  already revving up the motor cycle engine. Both men then sped off. Subsequently Police officers investigating the assassination reviewed footage of   more than a hundred   Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras to trace the escape route of the killer pair.

According to Police sources heavy rainfall had impaired  visibility of the footage in many instances. Nevertheless two  Police  teams perusing the CCTV footage  were able to discern that the duo had proceeded on the motor cycle along the main road through Matara,Nupe and Akuressa till they reached  Amalagoda junction,  21 km  away from the Weligama PS office. They had dismounted after passing  the Junction and split up. Thereafter both proceeded   on different motor cycles and went off the CCTV screens said news reports quoting Police sources.

Contrary to initial media reports that the Police had lost track of the suspected killers, the Police were quite active in tracing the movements of the suspects. Around ten special teams from the  Police, CID and FCID were engaged in a coordinated exercise to apprehend the killers.  They were directly supervised by the IGP Priyantha  Weerasooriya himself. Four teans  monitored  footage of  a number of CCTV cameras  from different strategic locations. Support was also provided by the State Intelligence Service(SIS).

The  Investigation got  a positive boost when information was received that suspectsconnected to  the Weligama  murder were hiding in the 50th Division area of  Kekirawa in the Anuradhapura District. Acting on this information , a special   Police team raided an abandoned building used for  paddy storage  on the morning of Oct 26th. There was a scuffle in which a Police officer sustained injuries  and was hospitalised.

Police however  arrested a man and a woman in Kekirawa. Police  also seized  a motorcycle,narcotics and over Rs. 12 Lakhs of cash. Police also arrested a “Vadai”vendor from Kekirawa who had assisted the suspects to hide in the building and also provided food.

A key suspect however had managed to escape. It was discovered that the man who escaped was in fact the actual killer who gunned down the Weligama PS chairman. The arrested woman was his wife while the arrested man was the accomplice motor cyclist.

The  suspect  who escaped was  identified as Hakunugoda Paranaliyana Nuwan Tharaka, a former  resident of Agulugama  near Bandaragama in the Kalutara district. The suspect Tharaka is 5 feet 6 inches tall, with the word “ANURADA” tattooed in English  on his right upper arm and the phrase “හිතුමතේ ජීවිතේ”(living life on one’s own terms) tattooed in Sinhala  on his left arm. Police released  Tharaka’s  photograph and appealed to the  public to provide any information leading to his arrest.

Meanwhile the chief suspect Nuwan Tharaka who evaded arrest in Kekirawa  arrived in Colombo reportedly by bus.  According to Police sourced media reports, he stayed at the Sahaspura housing scheme in Borella. Since his photograph had been released by the Police ,Tharaka went to a hair cutting saloon and  changed his appearance by shortening the hair on his head and shaving off his beard and moustache.

According to media reports, Tharaka  then went to Nawinna in Maharagama and purchased a phone  and accessories from a mobile phone shop. It was then that an off-duty Police officer attached to the State Intelligence Service saw and recognized him. The SIS official had followed Tharaka and with the help of local residents apprehended him. Those who aided the SIS officer were under the impression that Tharaka had stolen the phone.

Interestingly , Tharaka’s appearance had changed after the close haircut and shave.  He looked quite different to the photograph released by the Police. Then how did the SIS officer recognize him? According to Police circles,this  was due to the SIS utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to create eight 3D models of the suspect’s various possible appearances.All intelligence officials were given these. Thus when Tharaka went to buy a phone in Nawinna the alert SIS officer, though off-duty,  recognized him and was able to arrest him with the cooperation of the public.

Apparently Nuwan Tharaka has been involved in crime in the past. According to the Police, Tharaka the main gunman has nine  previous cases against him — six  for  theft, two for robberyand  one for possession of illegal firearms. However there is no record of him being implicated or being  involved in murder in the past.

The  arrest and preliminary interrogation of Tharaka,his wife and accomplice resulted in more information being revealed about the killing. According to Police sources the killing of Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Lasantha Wickramasekara alias Midigama Lasa had been plotted and directed by a Sri Lankan underworld  crime lord residing in the middle east  called “Midigama Chooty”.

Though Midigama Chooty was the mastermind behind the murder,he  had been arrested by the Police in Oman last June. Thereafter two persons in Dubai known as  “Dubai Lokka”(Dubai boss)and Rajitha.  It was Dubai Lokka and Rajitha acting under Midigama Chooty’s orders who interacted with Tharaka directly via phone and directed the assassination drama. Dubai Lokka is believed to be a native of Koggala named Wellaalage Chathura Kumara alias Chathura Kumara a.k.a. Chathura. Very little is known about the  other person Rajitha.

According to Police sources it was a contract killing and Tharaka was  merely a hired assassin.The fee was two million rupees or twenty lakhs. Of this Rupees fifteen lakhs had been paid in advance. A three-wheeler driver had brought Tharaka and his accomplice Lahiru to Weligama.  A motor cycle was given to him by another person. A third person had given him the pistol which Tharaka had reportedly  returned after the assassination.

After the shooting, the killers had fled on a motor cycle  which they changed  for another later on. Tharaka and his accomplice had split and travelled on two different motor cycles. Tharaka had gone to  Ambalantota where his parents and wife were. From there Tharaka and his wife had gone to Kataragama,Wellawaya and Mahiyangana  where the accomplice a 19 year old youth named  Lahiru joined them. The trio then went to Kekirawa , where the wife and Lahiru were arrested. Tharaka who escaped to Colombo was arrested in Nawinna.

At the time of this article being written,nine suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing of Lasantha Wickramasekara. Among these, six are in the custody of the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). They are the suspected gunman Tharaka ,his wife,his accomplice motor cyclist, the person who helped him in Kekirawa and the two persons from Sahaspura in Borella who gave him shelter. They are being held and interrogated  under a 72 hour detention order.

Apart from the above mentioned six, three others arrested by the Weligama and Matara Police  have been produced before the Matara Couirts and remanded. They were arrested for allegedly aiding the suspected killer or shooter. They are a  three-wheeler driver from Agulugaha area in Galle who provided transportation to the shooter before  the murder, the owner of a garage in Walana who repaired the motorcycle used in the murder, and a youth from Polathumodara who brought the motorcycle to the shooter Tharaka.

“Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde”.

The Weligama shooting was the 103rd of its kind to take place this year. 52 People have been killed in such incidents so far.  The 52nd victim Lasantha Wickramasekara  was a  native of Midigama in Weligama. He was earlier a member of the United National Party(UNP) but had split and aligned with the Sajith Premadasa -led Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB). Though Wickramasekara dabbled in open  politics, there was a darker side to his life too. He was allegedly linked to some  gangs engaged in drug peddling and possessed an unsavoury criminal record.Lasantha Wickramasekara alias Midigama Lasa was in that sense a “Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde”.

“Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde”was a popular novella weitten bt Robert Louis Stevenson of “Treasure Island” and “Kidnapped”fame. It is about  humans  beings possessing , good as well as bad characteristics. Stevenson writes about a kind and benevolent doctor named  Henry Jekyll who is also a murderous criminal named Edward Hyde. In popular culture the term Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde denotes a dual personality who is outwardly good but evil inside.

Lasantha’s own life embodied a troubling duality, a politician with public appeal and electoral success, yet shadowed by a criminal past and former ties to the drug underworld; a “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” in Sri Lankan local politics.

According to Police sources Lasantha Wickramasekara  alias Midigama Lasa was at one time closely associated with notorious drug dealer Nadun Chinthaka alias “Harak  Kata”. Lasantha  himself had  six cases  filed  against him in the Kurunegala,Matara and Galle Courts. He had received a suspended sentence in a case pertaining to a narcotics offence.Despite  this criminal record, the SJB had given Wickramasekara nomination for the Weligama Pradeshiya  Sabha elections in May 2025. It is said that Lasantha Wickramasekara had de-linked himself from gang activities and that there was a souring of relations with his erstwhile  underworld comrades.

Rival political parties especially the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP)led National People’s Power(NPP) had  criticized the SJB in general and Wickramasekara in particular over his  criminal record during the polls campaign.

.Nevertheless Wickramasekara won handsomely polling 67% of the votes in the ward he contested. The JVP led NPP won the highest number of members in the PS poll but did not get a majority. Wickramasekara then spearheaded a political move  to gain  control of the council by cobbling together a coalition of opposition parties.

This led to much controversy.There were allegations of two NPP councillors being abducted.  It was later found to be a drama enacted against the SJB. There was another instance of shots being fired at the house of a PS councillor. A female councillor was threatened over the phone.After hectic politicking,the SJB gained control of the Weligama PS in July. Wickramasekara with 23 Votes was elected chairman. The NPP candidate got 22.

The Pradeshiya Sabha chairman’s troubles were not over after victory. Lasantha  started getting  death threats from the time he was sworn in as Weligama PS Chairman. It appeared that the threats were from his erstwhile gangster comrades. It was indeed a puzzle as to why the “gangsters”chose to threaten him after becoming chairman instead of doing so earlier. Lasantha became a target of sorts. He was threatened openly through posts in social media.

A desperate Wickramasekara wrote to the IGP in late August seeking Police protection. He submitted an affidavit titled “Regarding  Securing my life Safety” requesting appropriate security measures due to threats to his life.He was denied Police protection. Thereafter Wickramasekara went around with some unofficial bodyguards. However these bodyguards were unable to prevent him being killed.

The killing of the Weligama  PS chairman and the fact that he was denied Police protection was raised in Parliament.   SJB Leader and leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa  stated as follows -“He(Wickramasekara) wrote directly to the IGP, warning of a planned assassination either while attending court or leaving the council premises. He submitted a sworn affidavit requesting adequate security during and after his official duties. Why did the government fail to protect him?”

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa Followed up saying  “If a citizen formally requests protection and the police ignore it, what are we supposed to say? It’s easy to point fingers, but Lasantha clearly warned of threats to his life. Authorities failed to act.”

The Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijeyapala  in a special statement to Parliament emphasised the following –

“Lasantha Wickramasekara, the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, was an underworld criminal despite being elected as a public representative,He has six Court cases. He is someone connected to underworld activities, serving suspended sentences.There have been disputes between underworld gangs in the recent past. This is one such dispute, and these disputes are escalating into murders”

Public Security minister  Wijeyapala also said  that Wickramasekara was listed in the government’s criminal registry (IRC) and  was therefore not eligible for police protection. He further said “Protection is granted under the Victim and Witness Protection Act. The police cannot provide security to registered criminals.”

The crux of the matter seems the “Jekyll and Hyde”duality of Lasantha Wickramasekara alias Midigama Lasa. Lasantha’s own life embodied a troubling duality, a politician with public appeal and electoral success, yet shadowed by a criminal past and former ties to the drug underworld.He was in that sense  a “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” in Sri Lanka’s local politics.

The SJB led opposition portrays him as  the politician Lasantha Wickramasekara and elected chairman of the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha. The Government depicts him as Midigama Lasa the underworld gangster with  links to drug dealers and narcotics peddlers. It seeks to shame the SJB for giving nomination to a gangster.

The Public Security minister Ananda Wijeyapala has  jumped  the gun by calling  the murder a gangland killing even before anyone was arrested. He has also tried to justify the refusal to grant the victim Police protection on the grounds that he was a criminal. Taking an obvious cue from the man on top, the Police strains every sinew to prove that Wickramasekara was indeed killed by gangsters or contracted killers. In their haste to please the political masters,the Khaki-clad fraternity goes to the extent of circulating confessions of an apprehended killer over social media.

It may very well be true that the Weligama PS  chairman was indeed a victim of gangster strife and was not killed due to political reasons. However the  ham – handed acts of omission and commission by the Govt  has resulted in a crisis of credibility. The Govt must ensure that the public should feel that a  genuine  investigation is being conducted. Justice should not only be done but also should appear to have been done.

Let me conclude with a few  troubling thoughts.. The Govt and Police may  be correct in calling the killing a gangland execution but why was Lasantha Wickramasekara killed  in his office while discharging his duties as the elected chairman of the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha? Why not somewhere else? Was this a  symbolic answer to the question  of  whether  the murder was  a political assassination or gangland execution?
