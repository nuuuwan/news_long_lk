Opinions:

- The article characterizes the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha election as an "emphatic rejection" of PM Narendra Modi's governance style, portrayed as authoritarian, favoring crony capitalists, and divisive.
- It highlights this election's results as a clear repudiation of Modi's brand of politics, and a vote for a more consultative government and respect for the Constitution.
- The author states that Modi's diminished majority will force the BJP to reassess its ideological agendas and pet projects due to the new dependence on coalition partners, who are less aligned with the BJP's Hindutva ideology.
- The article suggests that Modi may now have to scrap his planned 100-day plan for his third term, due to his new reliance on veteran politicians, who will likely pursue their own agendas.
- The write-up indicates that this specific coalition-based government is not only beneficial for Indian federalism but deems it as the way forward for Indian politics.
- The author suggests that an era of coalition politics would never lead to abrupt policy decisions, like demonetization or the repeal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.
- Overall, the article posits that the results of this election reflect Indian voters' wisdom and their preference for a strong opposition check, and interprets this as a win for democracy.
