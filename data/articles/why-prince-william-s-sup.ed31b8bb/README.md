Sri Lanka, famed for its biodiversity and cultural heritage, faces an unprecedented challenge: safeguarding its most iconic species — the Asian elephant. With over 6,000 wild elephants, the island harbours the largest population outside India, yet their survival is under severe threat. Every year, more than 400 elephants and 150 humans die due to escalating human–elephant conflict (HEC), driven by habitat loss, deforestation, and unplanned development. Conservationists warn that without decisive, coordinated action, Sri Lanka could lose half its elephant population within three decades.

In this pressing context, Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has made a timely appeal to His Royal Highness Prince William, Prince of Wales, seeking his patronage and partnership in launching a National Elephant Conservation and Coexistence Initiative (NECCI).

Why Prince William’s involvement matters

This appeal is far more than symbolic. Prince William is one of the most influential global advocates for wildlife conservation, with a proven track record of transforming commitments into measurable outcomes:

Through United for Wildlife, he united transport and finance sectors to combat the illegal wildlife trade, leading to the landmark Buckingham Palace Declaration.

In 2020, he launched the Earthshot Prize, designed to scale solutions for biodiversity and climate resilience.

His longstanding support for organisations like Tusk Trust and Fauna & Flora International reflects deep engagement with community-based conservation.

Prince William’s global visibility, credibility, and convening power uniquely position him to elevate Sri Lanka’s elephant conservation agenda onto the world stage.

A national crisis with global relevance

Sri Lanka’s elephants are not merely a national treasure; they represent a globally significant subpopulation of the endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus maximus). Protecting them contributes to:

Preserving UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and cultural heritage landscapes.

Advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals on biodiversity and climate resilience.

Meeting obligations under international conventions such as CBD and CITES.

This is more than a domestic issue — it is a global ecological imperative.

The economic imperative

Elephant conservation is not just an environmental cause; it is an economic necessity. Wildlife-based tourism is a major pillar of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry, with elephants as its flagship attraction. According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, wildlife tourism accounts for nearly 30% of nature-based tourism revenue.

Conversely, human–elephant conflict imposes a heavy financial burden. Crop losses, property damage, and compensation schemes cost the economy billions of rupees annually. A structured approach like NECCI could reverse these losses by promoting eco-tourism, creating rural jobs, and attracting sustainable green investments.

The progressive vision of NECCI

Previous Governments have attempted fragmented policies to address human–elephant conflict, but a cohesive, science-driven national strategy has remained elusive. NECCI seeks to change that trajectory by introducing:

Community-driven conservation models, ensuring villagers are partners — not victims — in coexistence efforts.

Science-led strategies, including habitat corridors, land-use planning, and data-driven conflict mitigation.

International collaboration, leveraging best practices and donor confidence through credible global partnerships.

Prince William’s endorsement could serve as a catalyst, unlocking technical expertise, international funding, and visibility for Sri Lanka’s conservation efforts.

A call for partnership

Following his recent meeting with the British High Commissioner in Colombo, Premadasa emphasised:

“Sri Lanka’s elephants are not just our national heritage — they are a treasure of global biodiversity. With His Royal Highness’s leadership and conservation network, we can build a sustainable future for both wildlife and our communities.”

This appeal reflects a progressive justification: that Sri Lanka’s conservation challenge demands international solidarity, science-backed planning, and leadership capable of mobilising global attention.

Conclusion: From vision to action

Sajith Premadasa’s call should be seen not as a political gesture but as a forward-looking strategy — one that recognises that protecting elephants is inseparable from safeguarding rural livelihoods, tourism, and ecological stability.

The question now is: Can Sri Lanka’s policymakers, global partners, and conservation leaders transform this vision into a sustainable, inclusive strategy for the future?
