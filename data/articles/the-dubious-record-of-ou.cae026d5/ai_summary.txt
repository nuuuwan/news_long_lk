Sri Lanka's President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has recently made remarks about the increasing numbers of people attending 'dansal' (free food giveaways) during Vesak, a key Buddhist festival, suggesting it is a sign that "life is returning to normal." However, critics argue this could be due to increasing poverty levels which have spiked following Sri Lankaâ€™s economic crisis in 2022. Moreover, law enforcement agencies received backlash for their late response to the arrest of four Sri Lankans in India suspected of Islamic State affiliation. Details emerged that the suspects had been radicalised and identified as potential threats following the 2019 Islamist attacks in Sri Lanka, but had managed to leave the country undetected. Authorities have only been able to arrest an associate of the suspects who had helped them buy air tickets, raising questions about the competencies of the country's security institutions.
