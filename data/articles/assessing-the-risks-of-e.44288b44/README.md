Assessing the risks of extreme weather events

Climate ChangeForecastingRiskSustainabilityGlobalOperational Risk

Climate change models point to increased frequency of extreme weather events. Severe droughts and heatwaves have already weighed on crop yields, and global temperatures in 2025 are likely to exceed the records reached in 2024.

So far, extreme weather events have been sporadic and in different parts of the world, but they are likely to start happening in a more synchronised manner as climate challenges rise. This would intensify the impact of such events and make their near-term management more difficult.

If extreme weather events have a significant impact on production, this could lead to shortages, straining global supply chains and stoking inflation. Higher agricultural commodities costs would extend to households, raising the cost of living and food insecurity. Food shortages in some parts of the world could lead to mass migration, or even resource wars, triggering severe political impacts that could ripple across multiple countries. Countries in Africa’s Sahel region are particularly vulnerable to food and water shortages, as a wave of coups have severely weakened state capacity to deliver necessities to the population, and political instability and a reduced presence of UN peacekeeping forces have raised the risk of conflict in the region. Bangladesh, one of the world’s most densely populated countries, is highly exposed to climate change-related weather disasters, which could cause mass population displacement, industrial disruptions, food and shelter shortages, and the spread of infectious diseases. Although advanced economies are relatively well prepared to withstand weather events, European countries in particular are still exposed to their effects, such as migration and refugee inflows as a result of weather disasters and food scarcity in poorer countries.

Companies that operate in regions where food production and supply are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions should be aware of the risk of social unrest and political instability caused by severe food shortages. Advances in technology and AI have made it easier to climate-proof assets. There are business opportunities for development and commercialisation of drought-resistant, double-cropped grains.
