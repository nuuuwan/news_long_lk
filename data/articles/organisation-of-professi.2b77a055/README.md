Celebrating a Golden Jubilee marks a remarkable milestone in the journey of any organisation. It is with great pride, honour, and a deep sense of responsibility that I step into the role of President of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA) during this historic year.

The OPA stands as the apex body representing all professional associations in Sri Lanka. In its uniqueness and distinction, there exists no parallel organisation in the country. As professionals united under the OPA’s banner, we carry both strength and responsibility—attributes that define our collective purpose.

Today, the OPA represents 52 professional associations across 34 disciplines, encompassing a vibrant network of over 60,000 professionals throughout the island. Together, we form a unified and dynamic force woven into the very fabric of society, dedicated to shaping a better future for Sri Lanka.

Inspiration for the OPA

The roots of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA) trace back to 1972, when a group of visionary professionals, inspired by a proposal put forward by John Chadwick—the first Director of the Commonwealth Foundation—embarked on a mission to establish a unified professional body in Sri Lanka. Chadwick had originally floated the idea of creating a collective forum for professional associations during discussions at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1965. His vision resonated deeply with Sri Lankan professionals who saw the potential of such a platform to elevate the role of professionals in national and Commonwealth affairs.

Dr. Nath Amarakone, a dedicated and far-sighted leader, took the initiative forward, along with several prominent figures including Dr. H.W. Jayawardena, QC—an eminent legal expert, brother of former President J.R. Jayewardene, and first President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, which itself celebrates its Golden Jubilee this year. Together with Dr. S.A. Cabraal, W.P. Gunathilake and other leading professionals, they met with Chadwick to further explore and shape this vision into a workable framework for Sri Lanka.

With growing momentum and a shared sense of purpose, a meeting was convened in 1972, attracting enthusiastic participation from 28 professional associations. This historic gathering led to the formation of a steering committee to guide the establishment of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka. While one group focused on building the foundational structure, another was tasked with drafting the constitution—marking the formal beginning of what would become the apex body for professionals across the island.

Dr. Amarakone recognised the growing importance of the private sector and the critical need for professionals to establish their credibility within it. He emphasised the responsibility of professionals in shaping effective policies and programs to enhance the efficiency of the economy.

He also highlighted the urgent need to elevate the credibility, responsibility, efficiency, and accountability of professionals to ensure they could operate with effectiveness and integrity. Dr. Amarakone stressed the national imperative of producing the right kind of professionals in sufficient numbers—individuals equipped not just with technical skills but with the appropriate mindset and ethical grounding.

He did not shy away from addressing pressing concerns such as the brain drain, which was already having a detrimental impact on the professional community and the broader economy. He also advocated for the independence of professional actions and underscored the intrinsic connection between the professional duties carried out by individuals and the political and social aspirations of the people.

It was from this foundational vision—grounded in foresight, responsibility, and national service—that the OPA emerged, laying the groundwork for what would become Sri Lanka’s most distinguished and influential professional body.

With 11 member associations, the OPA was launched on 29 May 1975 in Hulftsdorp, Colombo 12. At this meeting (the first forum meeting) formally adopted the constitution and office bearers were elected for the current year and a formal meeting of the forum was conducted with Dr. Amarakone being unanimously elected as the first president. The birth of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA) was marked not only by a shared vision but also by the collective commitment of its member associations.

It soon became apparent that the OPA would need suitable premises of its own. Land was generously allocated by the government, and work began on a building for the OPA. Member associations who wished to reserve space in the envisioned Professional Centre generously donated the funds they had raised for their individual building projects. This spirit of unity and shared purpose laid a strong foundation for what would become a landmark institution for Sri Lanka’s professional community.

Through the Foundation’s advocacy, a significant contribution was secured from Barclays Bank, enabling the furnishing of the ground floor. This level came to house key facilities, including the OPA Secretariat, an auditorium, as well as a restaurant and bar—creating a vibrant and functional space for professionals to gather and collaborate.

In September 1982, the Professional Centre was formally declared open by J.R. Jayewardene, former President of Sri Lanka. Since then, the Centre has grown into a hub of activity, with many member associations now occupying the first and second floors. It regularly hosts seminars and workshops on topical national and professional issues, which are widely attended and well-regarded.

With the successful establishment of the OPA and the Professional Centre, the organisation has evolved into a dynamic epicentre of professional engagement—advancing not only the interests of its members but also contributing meaningfully to national development.

OPA in a changing environment

The OPA began its journey during an era when Sri Lanka’s economy was predominantly state-led and protected through import substitution policies. Since then, the economic landscape has undergone a profound transformation. Today, Sri Lanka is deeply integrated into the expanding and dynamic global economy, becoming an active participant in the international value chain.

In response to these sweeping changes, the OPA has evolved rapidly—not only adapting to the demands of a fast-growing global environment but also positioning itself as a leader within this interconnected world. The organisation has embraced the principle of the “survival of the fittest,” continuously refining its structure and operations to meet the evolving needs of its members, the beneficiaries of its services, and the broader economy.

This adaptability is reflected in the OPA’s ongoing commitment to remain relevant, effective, and influential amid shifting economic realities, ensuring it continues to serve as a vital force in Sri Lanka’s professional and national development.

As Sri Lanka’s role in the rapidly evolving global economy changes, the OPA has broadened its scope and adapted its functions to meet these new demands. The organisation’s objectives clearly express its purpose, significance, and unique contribution to nation-building. OPA provides a vital forum for the discussion of professional matters and encourages multidisciplinary collaboration on issues of shared concern. It promotes the interests of various professions while safeguarding their common goals and standards.

Furthermore, the OPA actively fosters the participation of professionals in national and regional affairs, working closely with both governmental and non-governmental organisations to advance these interests. It supports the development of both existing and emerging professions across the country and advocates for the establishment of a National Council of Professionals to unify and strengthen the professional community. The organisation also offers facilities and services that enable its constituent bodies to function effectively and grow.

OPA’s contribution to society

The OPA continues to play a pivotal role in contributing to the professional, social, and national development of the country. The relevance of the OPA was especially evident during Sri Lanka’s recent economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, OPA mobilised its member associations to provide guidance on public health, digital adaptation for remote work, and economic resilience. It contributed professional expertise to help manage the crisis while also addressing the psychological and social challenges that arose. Similarly, during the economic downturn, the OPA provided practical, evidence-based policy proposals through its committees, calling for reforms in key sectors and helping shape conversations around recovery, stability, and long-term sustainability.

One of the most visible and impactful contributions of the OPA is the hosting of public seminars on critical issues affecting the nation. These sessions go beyond information-sharing—they create vibrant spaces where professionals from diverse sectors gather to exchange ideas, build networks, and engage in constructive dialogue. The popularity and positive reception of these seminars reflect the OPA’s strong connection to the public and its reputation as a trusted platform for professional discourse.

The OPA also strengthens democratic engagement by organising dialogue sessions with political leaders These forums serve as vital bridges between policymakers and professionals, narrowing gaps in understanding and fostering collaborative problem-solving on key national issues.

In celebration of its Golden Jubilee, and under my leadership, the OPA launched a series of high-impact brainstorming sessions to address pressing challenges in sectors such as food exports, transport, digitalisation, and the establishment of a development bank. These multidisciplinary discussions produced actionable, well-researched recommendations that are formally presented to policymakers.

To further enhance its impact, several new Working Committees were formed in addition to the existing ones. These were specifically tasked with crafting strategic documents targeting bottlenecks in nationally significant areas. Currently, OPA is also developing a comprehensive policy implementation strategy to ensure these recommendations translate into real outcomes.

The OPA’s voice extends beyond events and policy contributions through its widely read journal and newsletter. These publications serve as platforms for sharing insights, expert opinions, and updates on OPA’s initiatives—helping solidify its position as a thought leader in Sri Lanka’s professional landscape.

In today’s increasingly complex and uncertain world, the need for professionalism in governance is more critical than ever. During my tenure as President, I have remained fully committed to upholding the vision, determination, and values passed down by the founders and pioneers of the OPA. Guided by this legacy, I am taking every possible measure to empower our multidisciplinary membership to make meaningful and lasting contributions toward positioning Sri Lanka as a leading nation on the global stage.

The OPA’s role has expanded significantly in both scope and impact, and its relevance has never been greater. I am proud to affirm that OPA is well-prepared and equipped—with both expertise and human capital—to lead and support the national transformation process. Our members, drawn from across 34 professional disciplines, continue to serve as a critical resource in navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing global environment.

Successive Governments have consistently recognised the calibre and capability of OPA’s members, appointing them to pivotal roles within the State sector. This trust and recognition reflect the value and influence of the OPA within national governance. As we look ahead, OPA remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing professionalism and ensuring Sri Lanka’s progress and resilience in an evolving world.
