    "From left: Delfi Melo Detektorius Fact-Checker Monika Jakim\u010duk\u0117 and\u00a0Delfi Melo Detektorius Editor Aist\u0117 Meidut\u0117",
    "By Charumini de Silva in Vilnius",
    "As disinformation and propaganda increasingly shape public opinion across Europe and beyond, Lithuania\u2019s largest digital media outlet, Delfi, has become a frontline defender of information integrity through its dedicated fact-checking department Melo Detektorius (The Lie Detector).",
    "In the heart of Vilnius, a small but determined team at Delfi, is waging a relentless battle against falsehoods, propaganda and digital deception. Armed by its dedicated fact-checking division, Delfi has become a regional leader in verifying information, exposing Kremlin-driven narratives and educating the public on media literacy.",
    "During a recent study tour organised by the Internews under the EU-funded Indo-Pacific Media Resilience Program, a group of Sri Lankan journalists including the Daily FT, gained first-hand look at how Lithuania\u2019s fact-checkers operate independently, leverage technology and build global alliance to safeguard truth in an era increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence (AI) and misinformation.",
    "Dedicated fact-checking initiative",
    "Melo Detektorius Editor Aist\u0117 Meidut\u0117 shared how Baltics\u2019 largest online news outlet, Delfi\u2019s fact-checking efforts evolved in response to Russian disinformation and now stands as a model of journalistic independence and resilience.",
    "\u201cFact-checking in Lithuania began as a direct response to Kremlin propaganda. Our first major project, the \u2018Divan\u2019 was focused on debunking false narratives spread by Russian State media. Soon we realised that a separate dedicated fact-checking initiative was necessary and that\u2019s how Melo Detektorius was born,\u201d she explained.",
    "She said at present, Delfi\u2019s fact-checking division has verified over 3,000 claims; over 2,000 in Lithuanian and 1,000 in Russian.",
    "According to her, Melo Detektorius primarily verifies external disinformation, especially that circulates on social media. Its methodology combines systematic monitoring, reader engagement and rating system to classify claims as true, false, partly false or manipulative.",
    "\u201cWe found that ratings make our work easier to understand for the public. If we publish long, complex reports, people may lose interest. Ratings help communicate clearly and quickly,\u201d she opined.",
    "She also differentiated fact-checking from debunking. \u201cFact-checking focuses on a single claim, which is short, precise and evidence-based. Debunking is broader, like a mini-investigation into ongoing propaganda themes,\u201d she explained.",
    "Despite being part of the larger Delfi newsroom, Meidut\u0117 emphasised complete editorial independence. \u201cOur newsroom cannot dictate what we fact-check. They can only suggest topics, but we decide what to verify and how to do it,\u201d she added.",
    "Global and regional collaboration",
    "She said Melo Detektorius is a signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) Code of Principles and a member of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network (EFCSN).",
    "\u201cCurrently over 480 fact-checking organisations operate worldwide and Lithuania will have the honour of hosting the Global Fact 2026 conference in Vilnius, the world\u2019s largest gathering of fact-checkers next year,\u201d she noted.",
    "Meidut\u0117 also serves in the EFCSN working group that helped draft the European Code for Fact-Checkers, further cementing Lithuania\u2019s influence in setting continental standards.",
    "Regionally, Delfi contributes to the Baltic Engagement for Combating Information Disorders (BECID), part of the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) network based in Italy. This initiative unites Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to detect and counter narratives spreading across borders.",
    "Security threats and ethical safeguards",
    "Given Lithuania\u2019s proximity to Russia and Belarus, she acknowledged how Delfi\u2019s fact-checkers face harassment and threats from hostile actors online.",
    "\u201cWhen we used to publish our byline under every article, some of us received threats. In a small country, those same people could easily appear at your doorstep. So, we stopped listing names under each piece, but our team members are still publicly known in our \u2018About\u2019 section,\u201d she disclosed.",
    "She asserted that transparency remains central and all funding sources are publicly disclosed and Melo Detektorius does not accept money from political parties or actors. Core operations are funded by Delfi\u2019s parent newsroom, while EU institutions and other partners may support educational and media literacy projects.",
    "Meidut\u0117 admitted that fact-checking remains an unfounded and politically vulnerable field. \u201cNobody wants to fund fact-checkers as we question everything,\u201d she quipped. \u201cWhen populist Governments come to power, we are often the first to be attacked or defunded.\u201d",
    "Although Lithuania\u2019s relatively supportive environment, she cautioned that rising populism and AI-driven misinformation pose serious threats. \u201cStudies show false information spreads six times faster than the truth. With AI, it is probably even worse now,\u201d she added.",
    "She stressed fact-checking is deeply intertwined with technology and Delfi collaborates closely with social media platforms like Facebook through disinformation flagging programs.",
    "\u201cWe are increasingly focusing on prebunking, helping audiences recognise manipulation before it spreads. It\u2019s the future of countering disinformation and empowering people to think critically,\u201d Meidut\u0117 said.",
    "Delfi fact-checker Monika Jakim\u010duk\u0117 joined the discussion and outlined a rigorous process that blends forensic investigation with journalistic instinct. \u201cThe first steps are always the same, we begin with identifying a claim and end with a conclusion,\u201d she explained, taking the visitors through a typical verification cycle.",
    "She pointed to tools like Google Reverse Image Search, InVID and Google Earth, where Delfi\u2019s fact-checkers trace the origins of viral posts, geolocate images and detect AI manipulation.",
    "One example she shared involved a viral photo claiming that \u2018vaccination buses\u2019 were being sent to cemeteries in Poland, which after verification turned out to be an advertisement for a funeral company.",
    "\u201cWe now check for signs of manipulation or AI generation almost everyday. It\u2019s becoming a routine part of our work,\u201d she said.",
    "Jakim\u010duk\u0117 in her presentation showed another recent case, a seemingly real French stylist who claimed Ukraine\u2019s First Lady had spent half a million Euros on a handbag. \u201cShe looked and sounded real, but she wasn\u2019t. InVID helped us identify that her face and voice were AI-generated,\u201d she explained.",
    "Fact-checking in a polarised world",
    "She said the growing sophistication of such fabrications underscores a key challenge for journalists worldwide. \u201cAI-generated content is becoming difficult to spot. That\u2019s why collaboration and public awareness are imperative,\u201d she stressed, adding that Kremlin-backed propaganda and conspiracy narratives targeting NATO, the EU and public health dominate Delfi\u2019s monitoring radar.",
    "\u201cThe most common falsehoods we see are anti-NATO, anti-EU or pro-Russia. Health-related disinformation remains a big issue too, especially around vaccines and so-called \u2018miracle-cures\u2019,\u201d she remarked.",
    "Jakim\u010duk\u0117 admitted that perhaps the toughest challenge is not falsehood, but the public trust deficit. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like being told they are wrong. So, fact-checkers often become the enemy in the eyes of those we are trying to help,\u201d she said.",
    "Unlike newsrooms struggling to sustain fact-checking operations, Delfi\u2019s initiative is largely supported by its parent company, Delfi Lithuania, part of the Ekspress Media Group based in Estonia. \u201cWe also receive third-party fact-checking programs and we apply for EU-funded grants and collaborations with other organisations,\u201d she added.",
    "However, she noted that the future of platform-funded fact-checking is uncertain. \u201cMeta\u2019s program might not continue next year. So we are constantly searching for new sources of support,\u201d she disclosed.",
    "Prebunking and media literacy",
    "Beyond verification, she said Delfi has expanded into \u2018prebunking\u2019 and produces video explainers, interviews and educational sessions on topics such as climate misinformation and health myths.",
    "\u201cDuring the pandemic, we even held in-person meetings with doctors. We trained them on how to talk to patients who had been exposed to disinformation. People often trust doctors or librarians more than fact-checkers, so empowering them is crucial,\u201d she added.",
    "Jakim\u010duk\u0117 believes education is the next frontier in fighting falsehoods. \u201cYou can\u2019t survive on fact-checking alone anymore. The future is media literacy,\u201d she asserted.",
    "Sharing similar sentiments as Meidut\u0117, she noted concerns about populist parties that spread misinformation and undermine journalism. \u201cFact-checkers are always the first to go when populists gain power. We\u2019ve seen it in Hungary, Slovakia and even in Georgia, where some teams had to stop operations entirely,\u201d she pointed out.",
    "Delfi\u2019s collaboration with Meta has also made it a target. \u201cWhen we flag disinformation, it affects the reach of certain accounts. Then those people attack us. Some fact-checkers abroad have faced severe harassment and even legal action,\u201d she said.",
    "Noting that transparency remains the best defence, Meidut\u0117 recalled a case study in her career when an oversight in a sensitive story led to backlash and a reaction. \u201cAt first, I was devastated. But I learned that the most important thing is to admit your mistakes openly. That\u2019s how you rebuild trust,\u201d she said.",
    "Model for media integrity",
    "For the visiting Sri Lankan journalists, Delfi\u2019s experience illustrated not only the importance of independent verification, structural and ethical rigor needed to sustain it, but also a sobering reminder of journalism\u2019s evolving mission.",
    "In a world where it faces a growing flood of digital falsehoods, Lithuania\u2019s Melo Detektrious stands as a reminder that resilience, transparency and collaboration are essential to defending truth in the digital age.",
    "\u201cAs misinformation grows and AI blurs the lines between fact and fiction. The fight for truth isn\u2019t just about debunking lies, it\u2019s about defending democracy itself,\u201d Jakim\u010duk\u0117 stressed."
