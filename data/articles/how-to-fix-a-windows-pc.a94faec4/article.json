    "MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more here. Windows PCs have crashed in a major IT outage around the world, bringing airlines, major banks, TV broadcasters, health-care providers, and other businesses to a standstill.Airlines including United, Delta, and American have been forced to ground and delay flights, stranding passengers in airports, while the UK broadcaster Sky News was temporarily pulled off air. Meanwhile, banking customers in Europe, Australia, and India have been unable to access their online accounts. Doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals in the UK have lost access to patient records and appointment scheduling systems.\u00a0  The problem stems from a defect in a single content update for Windows machines from the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike. George Kurtz, CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO, says that the company is actively working with customers affected.\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\u201d he said in a statement on X. \u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.\u201d CrowdStrike pointed MIT Technology Review to its blog with additional updates for customers. What caused the issue? The issue originates from a faulty update from CrowdStrike, which has knocked affected servers and PCs offline and caused some Windows workstations to display the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d when users attempt to boot them. Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.",

    "The update was intended for CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon software, which is \u201cendpoint detection and response\u201d software designed to protect companies\u2019 computer systems from cyberattacks and malware. But instead of working as expected, the update caused computers running Windows software to crash and fail to reboot. Home PCs running Windows are less likely to have been affected, because CrowdStrike is predominantly used by large organizations. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cThe CrowdStrike software works at the low-level operating system layer. Issues at this level make the OS not bootable,\u201d says Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, and author of Philosophy of Cybersecurity.",
    "Not all computers running Windows were affected in the same way, he says, pointing out that if a machine\u2019s systems had been turned off at the time CrowdStrike pushed out the update (which has since been withdrawn), it wouldn\u2019t have received it.For the machines running systems that received the mangled update and were rebooted, an automated update from CloudStrike\u2019s server management infrastructure should suffice, he says. \u201cBut in thousands or millions of cases, this may require manual human intervention,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat means a really bad weekend ahead for plenty of IT staff.\u201d  How to manually fix your affected computer   There is a known workaround for Windows computers that requires administrative access to its systems. If you\u2019re affected and have that high level of access, CrowdStrike has recommended the following steps: 1. Boot Windows into safe mode or the Windows Recovery Environment. 2. Navigate to the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory. 3. Locate the file matching \u201cC-00000291*.sys\u201d and delete it.",
    "4. Boot the machine normally. Sounds simple, right? But while the above fix is fairly easy to administer, it requires someone to enter it physically, meaning IT teams will need to track down remote machines that have been affected, says Andrew Dwyer of the Department of Information Security at Royal Holloway, University of London.

    "\u201cWe\u2019ve been quite lucky that this is an outage and not an exploitation by a criminal gang or another state,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also shows how easy it is to inflict quite significant global damage if you get into the right part of the IT supply chain.\u201dWhile fixing the problem is going to cause headaches for IT teams for the next week or so, it\u2019s highly unlikely to cause significant long-term damage to the affected systems\u2014which would not have been the case if it had been ransomware rather than a bungled update, he says. \u201cIf this was a piece of ransomware, there could have been significant outages for months,\u201d he adds. \u201cWithout endpoint detection software, many organizations would be in a much more vulnerable place. But they\u2019re critical nodes in the system that have a lot of access to the computer systems that we use.\u201d hide"
