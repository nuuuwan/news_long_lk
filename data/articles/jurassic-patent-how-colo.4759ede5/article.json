    "Colossal Biosciences not only wants to bring back the woolly mammoth\u2014it wants to patent it, too. MIT Technology Review has learned the Texas startup is seeking a patent that would give it exclusive legal rights to create and sell gene-edited elephants containing ancient mammoth DNA.  Colossal, which calls itself \u201cthe de-extinction company,\u201d hopes to use gene editing to turn elephants into a herd of mammoth look-alikes that could be released in large nature preserves in Siberia. There they\u2019d trample the ground in a way that Colossal says would maintain the permafrost, keeping global-warming gases trapped and offering the chance to earn carbon credits. Ben Lamm, the CEO of Colossal, said in an email that holding patents on the animals would \u201cgive us control over how these technologies are implemented, particularly for managing initial releases where oversight is critical.\u201d",
    "Colossal intends to file patents on additional \u201ctransgenic\u201d animals, such as the genetically modified wolves it announced last week, Lamm said. In that case, Colossal used gene editing to insert about 15 DNA changes from the extinct dire wolf into gray wolves. The company touted this work as the first success for de-extinction technology, a claim that drew wide criticism.",
    "Colossal has raised more than $400 million and is investing in a range of gene-editing and reproductive technologies, although its business plans remain speculative. Lamm has suggested that each \u201cmammoth\u201d could generate $2 million in \"carbon capture services\" and that the company could collect a share of tourist dollars if it brings back other iconic species such as the dodo, which lived on a single island in the Indian Ocean.

    "Lamm said patents, which usually last 20 years, could provide \u201ca clear legal framework during the critical transition period when de-extinct species are first reintroduced.\u201d In the US, patents on genetically engineered organisms have been allowed since 1980, when the Supreme Court signed off on one for an oil-eating bacterium. The justices famously said patent rights could cover \u201canything under the sun made by man.\u201d That opened the door to patents on animals, including the cancer-prone OncoMouse, glow-in-the-dark aquarium fish, and, more recently, pigs modified to grow organs for transplants.   Colossal\u2019s woolly mammoth patent application, with its descriptions of modified cells and animals, represents \u201cthe current standard in biotech cases,\u201d says Cassie Edgar, a partner at the law firm McKee, Voorhees & Sease in Des Moines, Iowa. Yet Colossal\u2019s legal venture breaks ground in other ways. It appears to be an novel attempt to secure rights to the use of extinct DNA and could establish an unprecedented legal monopoly over wild animals, since one of Colossal\u2019s aims is to return revived species to their original habitats. \u201cThis could set precedent for intellectual-property rights over engineered versions of extinct species\u2014raising questions not just about science, but about who owns de-extinction,\u201d Edgar says. The basic de-extinction method works like this: Researchers obtain DNA from old bones or museum specimens and then use gene-editing technology to add ancestral gene variants to a closely related existing species.",
    "So far, no modified pachyderms have been born\u2014elephant engineering remains too difficult. But last week, Colossal set off an eruption of headlines when it claimed it had used gene editing to re-create dire wolves, a species that went extinct some 13,000 years ago. One of the furry white canids, named Remus, appeared on the cover of Time magazine, with the word \u201cextinct\u201d crossed out. Many experts dismissed Colossal\u2019s claim to the world\u2019s first successful de-extinction as hype. They noted that in reality, the animals are gray wolves with an unusual coat color; their genomes contain only a few bits of dire wolf DNA, but the two species differ by several million DNA letters. The company is taking steps to secure intellectual-property rights to nearly every aspect of its creations, even the names it gives its animals. MIT Technology Review found that Colossal had filed for trademarks covering some extra-hairy mice it revealed earlier this year, which were offered as evidence of progress toward a mammoth. One trademark reserves the name \u201cMammouse\u201d for use in the sale of \u201cstuffed and plush toys.\u201d Also trademarked is \u201cWoolly Mouse,\u201d covering its use as a motif for shirts, jackets, and athletic apparel.  Lamm says Colossal doesn\u2019t currently have plans to open a gift shop. But he does want to protect the \u201cbrand identity\u201d of the animals. \u201cIt seems like people connect with these animals on an emotional level, which is actually quite encouraging,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to ensure that we can protect our brand.\u201d The existence of a patent application on mammoth-like elephants could tap into lingering public doubts over whether legal monopolies should really apply to living things, especially elephants, the world\u2019s largest land animals. \u201cThere are people that are unhappy about that, but that is certainly a pattern we've seen for a while in the US,\u201d says Alta Charo, a specialist in legal issues raised by biotechnology who is Colossal\u2019s ethics advisor.

    "Revive & Restore, a de-extinction organization in Sausalito, California, that is working toward reviving the passenger pigeon, says it doesn\u2019t think the birds should be controlled by intellectual-property claims. \u201cRevive & Restore will not be patenting de-extinct passenger pigeons,\u201d says Elizabeth Bennett, a spokesperson for the organization. The organization envisions that if it succeeds in reintroducing the birds, they will be \u201cprotected under existing wildlife laws,\u201d Bennett says. Even some genetic engineers involved in the mammoth project, initiated more than decade ago at Harvard University, have mixed opinions on patenting de-extinct animals. Cory Smith, now a biotech executive, was a student when he helped prepare an earlier patent application on engineered elephants, which the school filed in 2021. \u201cI am not sure it should have an owner,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI have always been on the side that maybe the animals shouldn\u2019t be patented.\u201d",
    "During its press blitz last week, Colossal was careful not to reveal the exact genetic changes it had made to its wolves, telling advisors it needed to keep them secret for \u201cintellectual-property reasons.\u201d This prevented outside scientists from fully assessing the experiment. But it also would have also allowed Colossal to present the information to the patent office, since information already in the public domain can\u2019t be patented. In response to emailed questions, Lamm initially sought to avoid saying whether or not Colossal had filed for a patent covering the transgenic wolves, similar to the one on the \u201cmammoth.\u201d It\u2019s a sensitive question, since such a patent would mean the canids are articles of commerce, not wild creatures returned to their \u201crightful place in the ecosystem,\u201d as the company said last week.",
    "\u201cWe take a thoughtful approach to intellectual property that balances scientific advancement with sustainable business practices,\u201d Lamm said in his initial response. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to understand is that any IP protection would be limited to specific technical methods and innovations we\u2019ve developed\u2014not the genetic heritage of extinct species themselves. We see ourselves as stewards of this science rather than owners of these magnificent creatures.\u201d The pending mammoth patent paints a very different picture. First filed in 2023, it is titled \u201cWoolly mammoth specific gene variants and compositions comprising same\u201d and contains a list of 29 claims that seek to control both a long list of mammoth gene variants and animals whose bodies contain that genetic code. That is, this patent application doesn't cover any specific method or technology, but is instead aimed at securing rights to novel animals with genetic changes that alter their hair, body size, immune system, tolerance to cold, and even cognitive capacity.\u00a0 \u201cAny animal with woolly mammoth genes falls under the claims,\u201d says Jacob Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Patent offices will probably chop away at the application before it\u2019s approved and might even reject it. During the examination of a patent, inventors are typically required to narrow the commercial rights they\u2019re seeking to those elements that are truly \u201cnew and useful\u201d and also must steer clear of statutory prohibitions about what can be patented, which differ widely by country. \u201cI imagine very few of these patent claims are going to get issued as they stand,\u201d says Sherkow. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be a stalking horse\u2014er, mammoth?\u2014on what aspects of revived species are patentable.\u201d",
    "Ultimately, the reason Colossal is trying to patent elephants with ancient DNA in them could simply be that it gives investors a little more confidence in its novel and untested business plans in de-extinction.\u00a0 \u201cEarly-stage companies sometimes bet on long-tail events,\u201d says Andy Tang, a partner at Draper Associates, one of the venture capital firms that put money into Colossal. Tang, who says he isn\u2019t speaking for the company, believes that \u201cin the scenario woolly mammoth[s] become important for partners, then it would be better to create some barrier to entry.\u201d\u00a0 He adds, \u201cI think it is just cheaper to invest in patents early.\u00a0 Much cheaper to patent the core tech early in order to avoid being reactive.\u201d  hide"
