The recent batch for the Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) – Nursing Care training programme had completed the programme; it is conducted by the National Youth Services Council, in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO). It empowers youth with critical skills for Japan’s growing nursing care sector. The ceremony to award certificates to the students was held in Kandy.

200 youth from across Sri Lanka have successfully completed the SSW, marking a significant step towards better job opportunities both locally and abroad. The most recent cohort of 55 students received their certificates at the ceremony, with Isomata Akio, Ambassador of Japan, as the chief guest, alongside participation of Inoue Hiroki, Second Secretary, Embassy of Japan, Joni Simpson, Director, ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives and officials from National Youth Services Council (NYSC).

This milestone marks the successful completion of the training of several batches of students from Kandy, Matara, Kurunegala, and Pandura.

The SSW Programme offers a unique opportunity for skilled foreign nationals, including Sri Lankans, to access decent work in one of Japan’s most in-demand industries. At present, Sri Lankans can benefit from employment in 16 identified sectors, including nursing care. While Japan has a set ample quota for nursing care professional from Sri Lanka, only a small segment of the quota has been filled, leaving significant potential for further expansion.

Isomata Akio, Ambassador of Japan remarked during the ceremony, “Japan and Sri Lanka share a long and incredible history of strong cooperation between our two nations and peoples. The Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) programme provides an exceptional opportunity for youth to contribute to both Sri Lanka and Japan, while advancing their own aspirations. To fully benefit from this opportunity, I encourage young people to continuously improve yourself, refine your skills, including your Japanese language proficiency, and strive for ongoing personal and professional growth.”

Migration has long been a key avenue of employment generation and foreign remittances for Sri Lanka. However, many aspiring and those migrating face challenges due to lack of awareness and failure to acquire skills and qualifications that would ensure decent employment opportunities overseas. Which often leaves them constrained to jobs in hazardous conditions, low-skilled or semi-skilled categories and low wages. With the rising demand for care professionals in Japan, ILO’s UPLIFT project is increasing employability and access to labour markets through skills enhancement and work-based learning in the care sector. The project strategy of empowerment through up-skilling of aspirant and returnee migrant including vulnerable communities at risk on irregular migration focuses on dual outcomes of securing dignified employment, and safe and regular migration.

The Director of the ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives said, “In the recent years, with the pandemic and the economic crisis, youth have faced numerous setbacks in finding employment opportunities. The Nursing Care Specified Skilled Worker Programme establishes a critical pathway to securing decent work in the global care workforce. This training programme is timely and critical not only in terms of much needed jobs, skills and safe migration for Sri Lankan youth but also for addressing the global demand for paid care services and contributing to gender equality at work.”

Chairman of NYSC added, “This training programme marks an important step for NYSC and is a continuation of our efforts in equipping the youth of Sri Lanka with valuable skills and preparing them for global opportunities. Through such strategic collaborations we are empowering young individuals with the tools, knowledge and opportunities they need to fulfill their aspirations.”

The UPLIFT project is implemented by ILO and IOM and financed by the Government of Japan. The UPLIFT project is among Japan’s key development cooperation partnerships with Sri Lanka in promoting human security. UPLIFT enables Sri Lanka to better respond to the rapidly changing migration landscape by enhancing the skills of aspirant and returnee migrant workers and improving their access to vital information. UPLIFT aims to ensure decent work opportunities and safe migration pathways for all Sri Lankans, aligning with national and global priorities of decent work and sustainable development.

The only tripartite U.N. agency, the ILO, brings together governments, employers and workers representatives to set labour standards develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men work worldwide.
