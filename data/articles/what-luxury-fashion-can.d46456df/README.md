Three of the biggest names in online luxury fashion — Farfetch, Matchesfashion, and Yoox Net-a-Porter — have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, including losses, layoffs, and unpaid suppliers. Secondhand high-end fashion is also on the rise, yet nobody is turning a profit.

While each company’s problems are distinct, they all share the same challenges: How do you move inventory of a product with ephemeral value without destroying the perceived value of the brand? How do high-end brands differentiate their products and communicate product quality to customers effectively when the online environment removes several physical indicators?

Traditional marketers might say it can’t be done, and at first glance, the doubtful future of these three platforms suggests they may be right. Billions have been lost, and the conventional wisdom now is that low-margin online sales are a very different business than high-margin fashion. As Tom Chapman, a cofounder of Matchesfashion, told the Financial Times: “It has always been clear to us that a fashion marketplace business would struggle to be profitable. You can’t operate an ecommerce luxury fashion business on those margins.”

However, we believe that a novel application of a multichannel descending (or Dutch) auction method used by Royal FloraHolland, operator of the world’s largest wholesale flower market, could give the online platforms another chance.

The Dutch auction moves in the opposite direction from a conventional auction by starting with everyone’s highest bid and then working down. Homogeneous flowers from the same seller are sold in lots. A digital auction clock provides information on the current lot up for bids, including product photos and information about the quality, and indicates the lot’s current price. For each lot, the auctioneer sets a high price, and as the clock runs down, the price decreases. Buyers bid by stopping the clock, indicating they are willing to accept the price at its current position. The buyer who stops the clock first is the winner and can buy any number of units up to the maximum available. If any units remain, the auctioneer starts the auction again, and the price continues to fall.

The Dutch auction method allows the wholesale flower market to clear products at a fast speed: More than 40% of  cut flowers at Royal FloraHolland are sold this way. Other perishables, including plants, fish, or coffee and tea, are also cleared via this method. In recent years, like many other businesses today, a large proportion of the flower business has moved online. On the face of it, that shift should create problems for auction markets in perishables, where products display a high degree of variation in quality, which is harder to assess online as purchasers cannot rely on traditional physical signals such as feel, freshness, and fragrance. The same holds true for luxury fashion goods with its traditional signals such as look and feel, size, and color. How can high-quality producers differentiate their products?

Signaling quality: the presale channel

Royal FloraHolland has solved the quality signaling problem by establishing a presale channel through which flowers are offered online at fixed prices before the auctions. Our research suggests that auction bidders use Royal FloraHolland’s presales prices as not only signals of quality but also of where they should start their own bidding. After analyzing over a million lots of flowers traded over a year in Royal FloraHolland, we found that bidders who could consult prices on a presales channel tended to bid higher than those without presales price information, even when nobody actually bought anything through the presales channel (flower lots offered in presales generated around 8% higher revenues at auction than similar lots not offered in presales).

Generally, flower growers in the Royal FloraHolland collective lead with their top-quality lots for presales. “You have the least trouble if the presales have the best quality. So, the lower the quality, the harder it is to sell, or you have to list it at an extremely low price,” one grower told us. Having multiple sales modes helps the buyer by giving them multiple modes of price discovery and helps the seller as well by creating more opportunities to communicate with the market.

Although this approach might help solve the quality signaling problem, it may not seem obvious that even this version of the Dutch Auction would fit the apparel market, where a high price is often a key branding signal — marking not only quality but also exclusivity. You might expect that manufacturers of premium branded products would not enjoy seeing their products sold off quickly at discounts.

But as it turns out, they’ve been happy to live with low-cost reselling for quite some time.

Solving the branding problem: Filene’s Basement

Consider the automatic markdown system of Edward A. Filene, the son of the founder of Filene’s, a leading Boston department store in the early 1900s. The system was very similar to the Dutch auction: Every article brought to the basement was marked showing its sales price and when it was put on sale. Twelve days later, if it was not sold, it was marked down 25%. Six sales days after that, it was cut by 50%, and after another six days, it was 75% off. Finally, after six more days, it was given to charity.

It turned out that few items stayed on the rack that long: Some reports say that as much as 90% of goods sold were purchased within their first 12 days in the basement. Filene’s Basement, as it came to be known, became a national institution and even outlived the department store. The branded manufacturers selling through Filene’s were very happy to see their products sell so well in the basement.

How might this work today?

Dutch Auctions in Online Fashion: StockX and Vestiaire Collective

In 2019, StockX, the popular sneaker resales online platform, came up with a “blind Dutch auction” as a new way to launch limited and exclusive products for designed brands. Bids are submitted anonymously in the course of two to three days. Once the online auction is completed, the bids are sorted in a descending manner. StockX will then choose the top bids that match the number of quantities available as the winners. All the winners pay the same price, which is the lowest winning bid, known as the “Clearing Price.” According to StockX’s senior economist, Jesse Einhorn, this method allows StockX to sell thousands of items at once while not damaging the brands in the resale market. Many items are reported to be resold higher than the clearing price.

More recently, Vestiaire Collective, one of the world’s leading marketplaces for reselling luxury fashion brands, has started to use an online Dutch auction for its summer sales campaign. During the event, prices drop every hour and markdowns of up to 50% can be expected within the four-hour window. The event facilitates brand engagement and at the same time provides customers the option of getting a great deal.

Fashion sellers like these could also consider borrowing Royal FloraHolland’s presale channel concept. (Arguably Filene’s upstairs department store used to serve this function for the Basement.) One set of consumers could be invited to a sale prior to an auction, followed by auction bidders who get to see the market’s initial prices. A pre-auction sale would help anchor the price and signal the quality of a product nearer to something market-clearing while giving bidders a reference price they could use to inform their bid.

As all these examples suggest, retailers can use price discounting to generate sales of premium-branded products without damaging a brand’s reputation. A system like the Dutch auction with presales adapted to online fashion platforms could lead to more cleared inventory for the seller, more bargains for the customer, and less long-term damage to the luxury brand. Not a joy forever, perhaps, but definitely better than the view out the window at bankruptcy court.
