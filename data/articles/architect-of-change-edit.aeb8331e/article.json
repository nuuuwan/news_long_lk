    "People in this country want many things changed pretty fast. Now it\u2019s not merely a \u2018system change\u2019 that\u2019s needed; these are just loose words. People are looking for an \u2018architect of change\u2019. That individual is so hard to find. This is because people in politics don\u2019t know when to retire.",
    "When talking about \u2018change\u2019 it\u2019s good to borrow from American sport. Sports authorities and even sponsors of sporting events in America believe it\u2019s not good for the game if the same champion remains on top for more than two years. This is why a new sport star is promoted every two years; mainly to keep the sport alive and to counter ill effects of monotony that sets in.",
    "Development work and bringing crooks to book have been promises of politicians since the civil war ended. When one studies Sri Lanka from the perspective of the tenure of the last two presidents, there\u2019s nothing much to talk of. Even after an overwhelming victory for the \u2018comrades\u2019 the people\u2019s attitudes towards one another- starting from when commuting in public vehicles-suggest that the voter is not ready for change or transformation. The average Sri Lankan individual is too greedy or too lazy. Those treading the middle path and are successful in life would like \u2018change\u2019 but are not demanding it.",
    "The average Sri Lankan is at present engaged in at least two jobs to make ends meet. There was once a trend during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regimes when prominent national cricketers and film artistes were invited to engage in politics.",
    "One cricketer who managed two careers during this time was Sanath Jayasuriya. His cricket career spanned from 1989 to 2011 and he also held the post of Deputy Minister for Local Government and Rural Development from 2010 to 2015; hence there were a few years when he was a professional cricketer and politician both. Film artiste Ranjan Ramanayake juggled an acting career and a career as a lawmaker. There is a problem when juggling two careers in a country which is demanding change. There is an old saying that \u2018there is a danger when someone spreads himself too thin because then the pudding will have no theme\u2019. You become nether an actor/cricketer nor a politician when you become too greedy for success. We know how the Master Blaster struggled with the bat at the time he engaged in politics.",
    "Most Sri Lankans fond of the sport body building had a poster of star physical culturist Arnold Schwarzenegger pasted on their walls at home. When winning became too easy and he was getting bored of body building a door opened for him to dabble in films. Then he took to politics and became the governor of California. Sri Lankans must take a cue from Schwarzenegger; the \u2018Austrian Oak\u2019 was able to create an impact in whatever he did and most importantly loved all job profiles given to him. For the record, people close to Schwarzenegger have suggested two new jobs for him. One is for him to push for a privately funded space programme. The other is for him to try and become the President of the European Union with the aim of creating a more \u2018unified Europe\u2019. His ex-wife Maria Shriver had commented on Schwarzenegger\u2019s future endeavors by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have fun in whatever he chooses to do next, and he will have an impact\u2019.",
    "People in this island have seen, extreme greed, skills not supporting ambition, abuse of both power and position and sons killing fathers who were kings to sit on the throne. We need politicians who know the length and breadth of their capacities and what can be changed in this country and what cannot.",
    "There is at least one school in Sri Lanka which has a motto which underscores the importance of putting country before self. Much was achieved this way. But times have changed and now it\u2019s an era where people ask \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 before engaging in anything. You cannot change that mentality. If the \u2018comrade can ensure that someone found guilty of breaking the law- for personal gain- can never return to his past profession that would be something of great value achieved."
