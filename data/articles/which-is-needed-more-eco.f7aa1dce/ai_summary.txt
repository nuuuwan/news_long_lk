Opinions:
- The ETB appears more political than an economic necessity.
- The ETB doesn't seem to have the necessary planning to achieve economic development.
- An Economic Development Plan (EDP) would be a more pragmatic approach than the ETB.
- The current economic transformation attempts are illusory and can lead to bankruptcy.
- The ETB should put more emphasis on development banking.
- More faith should be placed on a plan rather than on the market for economic development.
- The ETB is intended to satisfy the IMF, even though it wasn't asked for.
- The article author criticizes the ETB for arbitrary targets without a practical plan. 
- Neo-liberal policies are inhibitive to the use of available resources for development. 
- The ETB maintains the 'dual-economy' for two distinct classes and is intrinsically flawed according to the author.
- The strategic sectors of power, energy, water, public transport, education, and healthcare should remain in public domain for many reasons.
