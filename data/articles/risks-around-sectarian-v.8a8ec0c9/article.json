    "Violent protests have continued in Bangladesh, largely targeting members of the previously ruling Awami League (AL), as well as the country\u2019s religious minority groups, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Muhammad Yunus, the new head of the country\u2019s interim government, has condemned the violence, but\u00a0EIU\u00a0sees a high risk of continued turbulence in the coming weeks, given the paralysis in policymaking, judicial and law-enforcement institutions.",
    "The developments align with our view that political instability\u00a0will persist\u00a0in the near term, despite the installation of Mr\u00a0Yunus and his continued efforts to settle the new caretaker administration.",
    "The ongoing violence, which we expect to persist, will worsen our security risk scores for the country, which are currently under review. There is a strong likelihood of continued disruption to transportation networks and other public infrastructure, despite reports indicating the restoration of internet access following the resignation and flight of the previous prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the AL.",
    "Worryingly, the latest developments suggest that violence may be taking on a sectarian tone. Recent attacks against minority Hindu communities\u2014Bangladesh is over 90% Muslim\u2014reflect popular anger over their perceived support for the AL (Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India, had championed closer ties with that country). There is an elevated risk that religious tensions may snowball into wider social unrest, while also worsening Bangladesh\u2019s relations with India.",
    "Worsening religious tensions present an immediate political challenge for the new government, particularly as Mr Yunus seeks to rebuild the country\u2019s democratic institutions. Large Hindu counter-protests, held on August 9th\u201110th, are now agitating for more (and protected) representation in the country\u2019s political landscape. The demonstrations have coalesced around four demands: a 10% allocation of parliamentary seats for religious minorities; the enactment of a minority protection law; the formation of special tribunals to investigate minority persecution; and the formation of a \u201cministry of minorities\u201d to better represent their rights.",
    "Mr Yunus\u2019s government has pledged to address both the recent violence and the concerns of the Hindu minority, but EIU expects this to be difficult. Police operations were suspended following the capitulation of the AL government on August 5th; this included a countrywide personnel boycott amid fears of public reprisals against police officers (who had enforced Sheikh Hasina\u2019s violent crackdown on earlier demonstrations). The police had reportedly ended their strike on August 11th, which will help to restore some stability.",
    "Low public trust, dereliction of duty, entrenched institutional corruption and significant anger against the country\u2019s police force\u2014which will affect recruitment\u2014will nevertheless hamper Bangladesh\u2019s law-enforcement agencies in the near term. This will be more severe in smaller cities and towns and more rural areas, and will complicate the efforts of Mr Yunus\u2019s government to re\u2011establish law and public order.",
    "The political situation will remain precarious for the foreseeable future in Bangladesh, preserving the risks facing company assets (and their staff) in the country. A swell in the number of refugees at the Bangladesh-India border would weigh on bilateral ties, and could compound tensions if violence against Hindus continues unaddressed in Bangladesh.The judicial system will also come under increasing strain; on August 10th the country\u2019s chief justice, Obaidul Hassan, and five other Supreme Court judges resigned in response to the demands of student protesters. We calculate a high risk (30\u201140%) of continued social and religious unrest, given the limitations facing Mr Yunus\u2019s government. Sectarian violence may be tempered by army intervention, as well as the re\u2011imposition of curfews and other movement controls, but at present we see only a low risk (10\u201120%) of that happening, given Mr Yunus\u2019s own aversion to a heavy-handed security response.Positively, 16 members of Mr Yunus\u2019s interim cabinet were appointed into various advisory roles on August 10th (with the AL shut out of governance). These include Saleh Uddin Ahmed (finance), Touhid Hossain (foreign affairs), Syeda Rizwana Hasan (climate change), Adilur Rahman Khan (industries) and Sharmeen Murshid (social welfare). Two members of the student movement\u2014Nahid Islam (telecommunications) and Asif Mahmud (youth and sports), both aged 26\u2014were also appointed. The inclusion of the two young activists reflects Mr Yunus\u2019s attempts to placate the country\u2019s student demonstrators, who continue to wield significant political capital, given their role in the collapse of the AL government, but raises questions over their inexperience in administration.This diverse coalition of appointees represents a welcome change from Sheikh Hasina\u2019s authoritarian style, but maintains anxieties over future consensus in governance. There is a very high risk (40%+) that the divergent views in Mr Yunus\u2019s government will complicate policymaking until fresh elections are held, which we believe to be unlikely until November 2024, at the earliest.",
