The race for the September 21 Presidential Election took a dramatic turn yesterday when the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) - the majority in Parliament – decided to nominate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son, Namal Rajapaksa, as the SLPP candidate for the elections. The SLPP’s Founder Basil Rajapaksa confirmed to Daily Mirror that at the last politburo meeting that the 38-year Old National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa would be nominated as the SLPP’S Presidential Candidate and his campaign will start immediately.

According to the Daily Mirror, Political turmoil erupted in the SLPP camp on Tuesday when business magnate Dhammika Perera pulled out of being named as the party’s Presidential Candidate at the last minute following rumours that he had been pressured to do so and was likely to join President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

In a letter to the SLPP General Secretary, the business tycoon said that he pulled out for personal reasons. However, the Daily Mirror had learned that Dhammika Perera has informed some of the SLPP members that his mother has fallen ill which is why he could not compete in the Presidential Election.

On the other hand, Namal Rajapaksa would become one of the youngest contenders for the Executive Presidents in the world. But the lack of experience on the dynastic dimensions of the nomination may have negative effects. Hitherto, the SLPP has been supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe and now the race is wide open. Among the front runners were President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Samagi Jana Balawegaya Leader Sajith Premadasa, and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna back NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

According to the Election Commission, as of August 6, 18 candidates have made their deposit for the Presidential Election. The candidates were: Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sarath Keerthirathna, Oshala Herath, A.S.P. Liyanage, Sajith Premadasa, P.W.S.K. Bandaranayake, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, K.K. Piyadasa, Sirithunga Jayasuriya, Ajantha De Zoysa, Ananda Kularatne, Sarath Manamendra, Venerable Battaramulla Sri Seelarathana Thera, Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathana Thera, Siripala Amarasinghe, K.R. Krishan, Sarath Fonseka, and Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as President on July 20, 2022 after the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the face of public agitation. Rajapaksa himself nominated Ranil Wickremesinghe as President and he was supported by the SLPP which had a large majority in Parliament. The country was facing one of its worst economic crises and most independent analysts say Ranil Wickremesinghe, during the past two years, has pulled the country out of the catastrophic situation and the economy is now stable. Political critics accuse him of acting according to the dictates of the International Monetary Fund and have threatened to amend the agreement if they come to power. But Ranil Wickremesinghe has defended his policy on the basis that Sri Lanka is receiving aid because of the support of the IMF and if given another term he could make Sri Lanka a third world developing country. Most independent analysts believe that Ranil Wickremesinghe is the best of the candidates to build on what was already been built in the economy and the country could benefit much by continuing Ranil Wickremesinghe’s policies.

The young Namal Rajapaksa, went to Anuradhapura on Tuesday to seek blessings before he was named and nominated as a candidate. For months Dhammika Perera had been requesting the party to name him as the Presidential Candidate, and although the party higher up had agreed to name him, following a last minute u-turn, the next possible candidate, Namal Rajapaksa was immediately pulled in to join the race.

The young Namal Rajapaksa was one of the members who had voted against supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe at the September 21 Presidential Election and said the SLPP would instead field its own candidate.

He had remained steadfast that the Pohotuwa would have its own symbol on the ballot paper and accused President Wickremesinghe for bypassing the SLPP Leadership and approaching the MPS directly to gain support.
