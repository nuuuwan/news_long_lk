    "The spirit of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, that is, reconciliation, fairness, and generosity, was eloquently emphasised by J.R. Jayewardene at the momentous occasion of the Peace Conference in 1951, inspired by the great teachings of Lord Buddha, \u201cHatred ceases not by hatred, but by love\u2026!\u201d",

    "This article will not deal with the history and support we have received from Japan during the last five decades or more except to say that Japan had been a benevolent and a generous friend to our country.

    "With the beginning of financial upheaval in our country, it was gratifying to note Ambassador for Japan Hideaki Mizukoshi spending most of his time evaluating the essential needs in areas where more vulnerable communities lived. Therefore, it is apparent that the Government of Japan wanted to make sure that the aid reached the most deserving communities.",
    "Thanks to the parent body of Japan Sri Lanka Technical and Cultural Association (JASTECA), Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), affiliated Association for Overseas Technical Cooperation and Sustainable Partnerships (AOTS) Japan, over 4,000 Sri Lankan managers and executives have been trained in Japan during the past three decades. Funding for these scholarships were provided by METI Japan with the courtesy of people of Japan. Japan has restarted this program having stepped up the support that was temporarily withheld during COVID-19.",
    "New innovative programs such as production improvement utilising digital technology, business innovation and organisation development and transforming to circular economy business models are some of the new scholarship programs that are offered to our young managers in the private sector. Whilst bringing the most valuable Japanese technology and know-how, it is heart-warming to see many Sri Lankan executives embrace entrepreneurship after attending these AOTS Japanese scholarship programs. This had also resulted in a strong alumni network of AOTS scholarship awardees in the South Asia in giving much needed business and cultural connectivity to these young managers in South Asia.",

It warranted winning of the hearts and minds of the people of Japan as they were the most disappointed due to this cancellation that caused irreparable damage to the people-to-people relationship between us. Our Ambassador in Japan Rodney Perera should be commended for reaching out to various Japanese communities and winning back their friendship and understanding.",
