Sri Lanka's Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekara, has announced that the government has concluded negotiations with the Indian Adani Group to purchase power from wind plants at 8.26 US cents per kilowatt-hour for 20 years. The agreement with Adani, which proposes to invest approximately $740 million to establish two wind power projects with a combined capacity of 484 MW, is expected to bring the best tariff the country has seen to date. Critics of the agreement are calling for a Swiss auction of the project to allow for new bidders, despite the Adani Group having already followed necessary guidelines and regulations and having their project approved by Sri Lanka's Public Utilities Commission. The minister argues that the additional capacity will need to come from private sector sources to meet the projected annual power demand growth rate of ~5% over the next 25 years.
