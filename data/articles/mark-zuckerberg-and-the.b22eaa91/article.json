    "This article first appeared in The Debrief,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly newsletter from our editor in chief Mat Honan. To receive it in your inbox every Friday, \u00a0sign up here. On Tuesday last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a blog post and video titled \u201cMore Speech and Fewer Mistakes.\u201d \u00a0Zuckerberg\u2014whose previous self-acknowledged mistakes include\u00a0the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, allowing\u00a0a militia to put out a call to arms\u00a0on Facebook that presaged two killings in Wisconsin, and helping to\u00a0fuel a genocide in Myanmar\u2014announced that Meta is done with fact checking in the US, that it will roll back \u201crestrictions\u201d on speech, and is going to start showing people more tailored political content in their feeds. \u00a0  \u201cI started building social media to give people a voice,\u201d he said while wearing a\u00a0$900,000 wristwatch. While the end of fact checking has gotten most of the attention, the\u00a0changes to its hateful speech policy\u00a0are also notable. Among\u00a0other things, the company will now allow people to call transgender people \u201cit,\u201d or to argue that women are property, or to claim homosexuality is a mental illness. (This\u00a0went over predictably well\u00a0with LGBTQ employees at Meta.) Meanwhile, thanks to that \u201cmore personalized approach to political content,\u201d it looks like\u00a0polarization\u00a0is back on the menu, boys.",
    "Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement was one of the most cynical displays of revisionist history I hope I\u2019ll ever see. As very many people have pointed out, it seems to be little more than an effort to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration\u2014complete with a roll out on\u00a0Fox and Friends. I\u2019ll leave it to others right now to parse the specific political implications here (and many people are certainly doing so). Rather, what struck me as so cynical was the way Zuckerberg presented Facebook\u2019s history of fact-checking and content moderation as something he was pressured into doing by the government and media. The reality, of course, is that these were his decisions. He structured Meta so that\u00a0he has near total control over it. He famously calls the shots,\u00a0and always has.",
    "Yet in Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Zuckerberg tries to blame others for the policies he himself instituted and endorsed. \u201cGovernments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more,\u201d he said. He went on: \u201cAfter Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US.\u201d While I\u2019m not here to defend Meta\u2019s fact checking system, I never thought it was particularly useful or effective, let\u2019s get into the claims that it was done at the behest of the government and \u201clegacy media.\u201d To start: The US government has never taken any meaningful enforcement actions against Meta whatsoever, and definitely nothing meaningful related to misinformation. Full stop. End of story. Call it a day. Sure, there have been\u00a0fines\u00a0and\u00a0settlements, but for a company the size of Meta, these were mosquitos to be slapped away. Perhaps more significantly, there is\u00a0an FTC antitrust case working its way through the court, but it again has nothing to do with censorship or fact-checking.  And when it comes to the media, consider the real power dynamics at play. Meta, with a current market cap of $1.54 trillion, is worth more than the combined value of the Walt Disney Company (which owns ABC news), Comcast (NBC), Paramount (CBS), Warner Bros (CNN), the New York Times Company, and Fox Corp (Fox News). In fact, Zuckerberg\u2019s\u00a0estimated personal net worth\u00a0is greater than the market cap of any of those single companies. Meanwhile, Meta\u2019s audience completely dwarfs that of any \u201clegacy media\u201d company. According to the tech giant, it\u00a0enjoys some 3.29 billion daily active users. Daily! And as the company has repeatedly shown, including in this week\u2019s announcements, it is more than willing to twiddle its knobs to control what that audience sees from the legacy media. As a result, publishers have long bent the knee to Meta to try and get even slivers of that audience. Remember the\u00a0pivot to video? Or\u00a0Instant Articles? Media has spent more than a decade now trying to respond or get ahead of what Facebook says it wants to feature, only for it to change its mind and throttle traffic. The notion that publishers have any leverage whatsoever over Meta is preposterous. I think it\u2019s useful to go back and look at how the company got here.",
    "Once upon a time Twitter was an actual threat to Facebook\u2019s business. After the 2012 election, for which Twitter was central and Facebook was an afterthought, Zuckerberg and company went hard after news. It created share buttons so people could easily drop content from around the Web into their feeds. By 2014, Zuckerberg\u00a0was saying he wanted it to be the \u201cperfect personalized newspaper\u201d for everyone in the world. But there were consequences to this. By 2015, it had a fake news epidemic on its hands,\u00a0which it was well aware of. By the time the election rolled around in 2016, Macedonian teens had\u00a0famously turned fake news into an arbitrage play, creating bogus pro-Trump news stories expressly to take advantage of the combination of Facebook traffic and Google AdSense dollars. Following the 2016 election, this all\u00a0blew up in Facebook\u2019s face. And in December of that year,\u00a0it announced it would begin partnering with fact checkers. A year later, Zuckerberg went on to say the issue of misinformation was \u201ctoo important an issue to be dismissive.\u201d Until, apparently, right now. Zuckerberg elided all this inconvenient history. But let\u2019s be real. No one forced him to hire fact checkers. No one was in a position to even truly pressure him to do so. If that were the case, he would not now be in a position to fire them from behind a desk wearing his $900,000 watch. He made the very choices which he now seeks to shirk responsibility for. But here\u2019s the thing, people already know Mark Zuckerberg too well for this transparent sucking up to be effective.  Republicans already hate Zuck. Sen. Lindsey Graham has accused him of having blood on his hands. Sen. Josh Hawley\u00a0forced him to make an awkward apology\u00a0to the families of children harmed on his platform. Sen. Ted Cruz has, on\u00a0multiple occasions,\u00a0torn into him. Trump famously\u00a0threatened to throw him in prison. But so too do Democrats. Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders, and\u00a0AOC\u00a0have all ripped him. And among the general public, he\u2019s both\u00a0less popular\u00a0than\u00a0Trump\u00a0and more disliked than\u00a0Joe Biden. He loses on both counts to\u00a0Elon Musk. Tuesday\u2019s announcement ultimately seems little more than pandering for\u00a0an audience that will never accept him. And while it may not be successful at winning MAGA over, at least the shamelessness and ignoring all past precedent is fully in character. After all, let\u2019s remember what Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0was busy doing\u00a0in 2017: Image: Mark Zuckerberg Instagram  Now read the rest of The Debrief The News \u2022 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s remarks about quantum computing\u00a0caused quantum stocks to plummet.",

The Chat  Every week, I talk to one of\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s journalists to go behind the scenes of a story they are working on. But this week, I turned the tables a bit and asked some of our editors to grill me about\u00a0my recent story on the rise of generative search.Charlotte Jee:\u00a0What makes you feel so sure that AI search is going to take off? Mat:\u00a0I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any going back. There are definitely problems with it\u2014it can be wild with inaccuracies when it cobbles those answers together. But I think, for the most part it is, to refer to my old colleague Rob Capps\u2019 phenomenal essay,\u00a0good enough. And I think that\u2019s what usually wins the day. Easy answers that are good enough. Maybe that\u2019s a sad statement, but I think it\u2019s true. Will Douglas Heaven:\u00a0For years I've been asked if I think AI will take away my job and I always scoffed at the idea. Now I'm not so sure. I still don't think AI is about to do my job exactly. But I think it might destroy the business model that makes my job exist. And that's entirely down to this reinvention of search. As a journalist\u2014and editor of the magazine that pays my bills\u2014how worried are you? What can you\u2014we\u2014do about it?",
    "Mat:\u00a0Is this a trap? This feels like a trap, Will. I\u2019m going to give you two answers here. I think we, as in\u00a0MIT Technology Review, are relatively insulated here. We\u2019re a subscription business. We\u2019re less reliant on traffic than most. We\u2019re also technology wonks, who tend to go deeper than what you might find in most tech pubs, which I think plays to our benefit. But I am worried about it and I do think it will be a problem for us, and for others. One thing Rand Fishkin,\u00a0who has long studied zero-click searches\u00a0at SparkToro, said to me that wound up getting cut from my story was that brands needed to think more and more about how to build brand awareness. You can do that, for example, by being oft-cited in these models, by being seen as a reliable source. Hopefully, when people ask a question and see us as the expert the model is leaning on, that helps us build our brand and reputation. And maybe they become a readers. That\u2019s a lot more leaps than a link out, obviously. But as he also said to me, if your business model is built on search referrals\u2014and for a lot of publishers that is definitely the case\u2014you\u2019re in trouble. Will:\u00a0Is \u201cGoogle\u201d going to survive as a verb? If not, what are we going to call this new activity? Mat:\u00a0I kinda feel like it is already dying. This is anecdotal, but my kids and all their friends almost exclusively use the phrase \u201csearch up.\u201d As in \u201csearch up George Washington\u201d or \u201csearch up a pizza dough recipe.\u201d Often it\u2019s followed by a platform, \u00a0search up \u201cCharli XCX on Spotify.\u201d We live in California. What floored me was when I heard kids in New Hampshire and Georgia using the exact same phrase.",
    "But also I feel like we\u2019re just going into a more conversational mode here. Maybe we don\u2019t call it anything. James O\u2019Donnell:\u00a0I found myself highlighting this line from your piece: \"Who wants to have to learn when you can just know?\" Part of me thinks the process of finding information with AI search is pretty nice\u2014it can allow you to just follow your own curiosity a bit more than traditional search. But I also wonder how the meaning of research may change. Doesn't the process of \"digging\" do something for us and our minds that AI search will eliminate? Mat: Oh, this occurred to me too! I asked about it in one of my conversations with Google in fact. Blake Montgomery\u00a0has a fantastic essay on this very thing. He talks about how he can\u2019t navigate without Google Maps, can\u2019t meet guys without Grindr, and wonders what effect ChatGPT will have on him. If you have not previously, you should read it. Niall Firth:\u00a0How much do you use AI search yourself? Do you feel conflicted about it? Mat:\u00a0I use it quite a bit. I find myself crafting queries for Google that I think will generate an AI Overview in fact. And I use ChatGPT a lot as well. I like being able to ask a long, complicated question, and I find that it often does a better job of getting at the heart of what I\u2019m looking for \u2014 especially when I\u2019m looking for something very specific\u2014because it can suss out the intent along with the key words and phrases. For example, for the story above I asked \u201cWhat did Mark Zuckerberg say about misinformation and harmful content in 2016 and 2017? Ignore any news articles from the previous few days and focus only on his remarks in 2016 and 2017.\u201d \u00a0The top traditional Google result for that query\u00a0was this story\u00a0that I would have wanted specifically excluded. It also coughed up several others from the last few days in the top results. But ChatGPT was able to understand my intent and helped me find the older source material. And yes, I feel conflicted. Both because I worry about its economic impact on publishers and I\u2019m well aware that there\u2019s a lot of junk in there. It\u2019s also just sort of\u2026 an unpopular opinion. Sometimes it feels a bit like smoking, but I do it anyway.  The Recommendation  Most of the time, the recommendation is for something positive that I think people will enjoy. A song. A book. An app. Etc. This week though I\u2019m going to suggest you take a look at something a little more unsettling. Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub, set out to try and understand how much microplastic is in our food supply. He and a team tested hundreds of samples from foods drawn from the San Francisco Bay Area (but very many of which are nationally distributed). The results are pretty shocking. As a disclaimer on the site reads: \u201cwe have refrained from drawing high-confidence conclusions from these results, and we think that you should, too. Consider this a snapshot of our raw test results, suitable as a starting point and inspiration for further work, but not solid enough on its own to draw conclusions or make policy recommendations or even necessarily to alter your personal purchasing decisions.\u201d With that said:\u00a0check it out. hide"
