Is resentment simmering on your team? Sometimes resentment looks like lashing out; other times it manifests as silence or withdrawal. In this article, the author shares advice from two experts on what to do if you’re worried about resentment building on your team: 1) Don’t assume the issue will resolve on its own. 2) Stay close to your team. 3) If you see something, say something. 4) Embrace tough feedback. 5) Advocate for your team. 6) Shake things up. 7) Focus on common goals.

Subtle digs, snarky asides, and petty nitpicking — at first, you might have brushed off your team’s behavior as banter or harmless sarcasm. But as tensions mount, it’s clear that there’s a deeper issue at play: resentment is simmering. How should you address it with your team? How can you counteract the negative vibes? And what are some ways to create a supportive, healthier dynamic?
