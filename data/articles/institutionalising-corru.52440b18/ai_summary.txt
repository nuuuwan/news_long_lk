1. 🛃 The proposed Office for International Trade (OIT) in Sri Lanka could negatively impact the nation's economy and domestic industries.
2. 🌍 OIT may replace the Department of Commerce (DOC) in handling international trade, possibly leading to issues of corruption and nepotism.
3. 💼 Originally, the OIT was drafted as the Agency for International Trade (AIT) but was rejected due to public outcry and opposition in Parliament.
4. 💰 The AIT's failings include a lack of technical personnel and accusations of corruption, with some AIT members reportedly securing individual benefits.
5. 🔄 OIT would take on the same responsibilities as DOC, leading to fears about a lack of accountability compared to the checks and balances in place for DOC.
6. 🗳️ The head of OIT would be appointed by the President for a four-year term, with board members also appointed by presidential decree.
7. 💼 DOC professionals are subject to regular performance assessments and require specific qualifications, while the qualifications needed for the OIT board are less stringent.
8. 🔧 There are concerns over potential conflicts of interest within the OIT since issues around this topic would be determined solely by the president.
9. 🏦 The OIT would run on its own fund, separate from the General Treasury, raising further concerns about transparency and compromise.
10. 🤝 Due to its political constitution, the OIT could allegedly provide opportunities for nepotism in placements at International Trade Offices abroad.

Note: This was a highly critical assessment and may not reflect the actual implication of the OIT.
