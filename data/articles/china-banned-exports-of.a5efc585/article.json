    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. I\u2019ve thought more about gallium and germanium over the last week than I ever have before (and probably more than anyone ever should).  As you may already know, China banned the export of those materials to the US last week and placed restrictions on others. The move is just the latest drama in escalating trade tensions between the two countries. While the new export bans could have significant economic consequences, this might be only the beginning. China is a powerhouse, and not just in those niche materials\u2014it\u2019s also a juggernaut in clean energy, and particularly in battery supply chains. So what comes next could have significant consequences for EVs and climate action more broadly.",
    "A super-quick catch-up on the news here: The Biden administration recently restricted exports of chips and other technology that could help China develop advanced semiconductors. Also, president-elect Donald Trump has floated all sorts of tariffs on Chinese goods. Apparently in response to some or all of this, China banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials used in manufacturing, and said it may further restrict graphite sales. The materials are all used for both military and civilian technologies, and significantly, gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors.",
    "It\u2019s a ramp-up from last July, when China placed restrictions on gallium and germanium exports after enduring years of restrictions by the US and its Western allies on cutting-edge technology. (For more on the details of China\u2019s most recent move, including potential economic impacts, check out the full coverage from my colleague James Temple.) What struck me about this news is that this could be only the beginning, because China is central to many of the supply chains snaking around the globe. This is no accident\u2014take gallium as an example. The metal is a by-product of aluminum production from bauxite ore. China, as the world\u2019s largest aluminum producer, certainly has a leg up to be a major player in the niche material. But other countries could produce gallium, and I\u2019m sure more will. China has a head start because it invested in gallium separation and refining technologies. A similar situation exists in the battery world. China is a dominant player all over the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries\u2014not because it happens to have the right metals on its shores (it doesn\u2019t), but because it\u2019s invested in extraction and processing technologies.  Take lithium, a crucial component in those batteries. China has around 8% of the world\u2019s lithium reserves but processes about 58% percent of the world\u2019s lithium supply. The situation is similar for other key battery metals. Nickel that\u2019s mined in Indonesia goes to China for processing, and the same goes for cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Over the past two decades, China has thrown money, resources, and policy behind electric vehicles. Now China leads the world in EV registrations, many of the largest EV makers are Chinese companies, and the country is home to a huge chunk of the supply chain for the vehicles and their batteries. As the world begins a shift toward technologies like EVs, it\u2019s becoming clear just how dominant China\u2019s position is in many of the materials crucial to building that tech. Lithium prices have dropped by 80% over the past year, and while part of the reason is a slowdown in EV demand, another part is that China is oversupplying lithium, according to US officials. By flooding the market and causing prices to drop, China could make it tougher for other lithium processors to justify sticking around in the business.",
    "The new graphite controls from China could wind up affecting battery markets, too. Graphite is crucial for lithium-ion batteries, which use the material in their anodes. It\u2019s still not clear whether the new bans will affect battery materials or just higher-purity material that\u2019s used in military applications, according to reporting from Carbon Brief. To this point, China hasn\u2019t specifically banned exports of key battery materials, and it\u2019s not clear exactly how far the country would go. Global trade politics are delicate and complicated, and any move that China makes in battery supply chains could wind up coming back to hurt the country\u2019s economy.\u00a0 But we could be entering into a new era of material politics. Further restrictions on graphite, or moves that affect lithium, nickel, or copper, could have major ripple effects around the world for climate technology, because batteries are key not only for electric vehicles, but increasingly for our power grids.\u00a0 While it\u2019s clear that tensions are escalating, it\u2019s still unclear what\u2019s going to happen next. The vibes, at best, are uncertain, and this sort of uncertainty is exactly why so many folks in technology are so focused on how to diversify global supply chains. Otherwise, we may find out just how tangled those supply chains really are, and what happens when you yank on threads that run through the center of them.\u00a0   Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading Check out James Temple\u2019s breakdown of what China\u2019s ban on some rare minerals could mean for the US. Last July, China placed restrictions on some of these materials\u2014read this story from Zeyi Yang, who explains what the moves and future ones might mean for semiconductor technology. As technology shifts, so too do the materials we need to build it. The result: a never-ending effort to build out mining, processing, and recycling infrastructure, as I covered in a feature story earlier this year.
