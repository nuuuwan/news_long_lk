Sri Lankans are a little uneasy due to the high prices of coconuts and the shortage of the nut itself in the island. Now we hear of plans being in the pipeline for the Government to import coconut-based products. This is a roundabout way to meet the shortage of coconuts in this island. But according to newspaper reports, the import plan for coconut related products must first go through a cabinet paper which must then be passed in parliament. The cabinet paper for this purpose is already drafted. But there was a delay in it reaching parliament because the government was making a reassessment of the list of coconut related products to be imported.

The government is eyeing Indonesia to supply the islanders with products made from coconuts. Will this affect the local market which is already flooded with coconut-based products? Even now, in some areas in the island, there is a shortage of rice. Now we are talking about a shortage of coconuts. Rice and coconuts are so important in the staple diet of Sri Lankans.

There are experts on agriculture who question the outcome when Sri Lankans use these imported coconut-based imports, include them in our very own creations and label them as made in Sri Lanka. People abroad, then might not trust the label ‘made in Sri Lanka’ because there could be ingredients included which were not originally grown in this island.

Whatever the government does and endorses, it must preserve two things; safeguard the ‘made in Sri Lanka tag’ and also the local industries revolving around the coconut tree.

All these shortages, including coconuts among other things, could be the work of a mafia that is operating in the country. The president is trying hard to sort out the rice crisis. The same efforts must be put to find a solution to the exorbitant prices of coconuts. Many believe that where ever there is a shortage of coconuts, it is artificially created.

Coconut cultivation was present in this island even before 1st century BC. Coconut cultivation flourished in Sri Lanka in the coastal areas from Chilaw to Matara in the post Anuradhapura era. There are records to show that when the British were ruling this country, they imposed a tax on the coconut palms that were owned by the natives. This shows that the coconut tree can be used by the rulers of a country as a tool to control the people and also fatten state coffers via taxes.

On the other hand, any unwanted government influence on the coconut tree and its fruits could also backfire on a regime. Coconut is also the main source that produces ‘Ceylon’ coconut arrack. This is a product that most locals consume with the belief that it contains certain health properties. Also this regime must consider that the coconut is also a ‘must purchase item’ that’s taken by Hindus when they visit the kovil (Shrine). Most housewives here in this island vouch that the curries they make might not be at their brilliant best in terms of taste if coconut milk that goes into them is replaced with water as a substitute.

We can remember a former president banning the import of over 300 items to make sure the dollar reserves in the government’s coffers were safeguarded. Now what will happen to that reserve if Sri Lanka starts importing coconut based products and start paying our suppliers with US dollars? The IMF has put certain regulations on our spending. But even entertaining the thought of importing coconut-based products suggests that Sri Lankans haven’t tightened their budgets nor adjusted certain aspects of their lifestyles which are costly to maintain. From a dining table perspective, we all know that coconut sambol is now considered a rich man’s dish!

If a mafia is operating, as suggested, with regard to rice and coconuts, then the regime will be compelled to encourage imports to meet the demand. We only hope that sanity prevails and people of Sri Lanka can start enjoying a meal of rice and curry without having to pay exorbitant prices when shopping for the raw items (that make those dishes) in the grocery store.
