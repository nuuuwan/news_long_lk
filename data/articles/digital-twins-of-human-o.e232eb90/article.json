    "A healthy heart beats at a steady rate, between 60 and 100 times a minute. That\u2019s not the case for all of us, I\u2019m reminded, as I look inside a cardboard box containing around 20 plastic hearts\u2014each a replica of a real human one. The hearts, which previously sat on a shelf in a lab in West London, were generated from MRI and CT scans of people being treated for heart conditions at Hammersmith Hospital next door. Steven Niederer, a biomedical engineer at the Alan Turing Institute and Imperial College London, created them on a 3D printer in his office.  One of the hearts, printed in red recycled plastic, looks as I imagine a heart to look. It just about fits in my hand, and the chambers have the same dimensions as the ones you might see in a textbook. Perhaps it helps that it\u2019s red. The others look enormous to me. One in particular, printed in black plastic, seems more than twice the size of the red one. As I find out later, the person who had the heart it was modeled on suffered from heart failure. Advertisement The plastic organs are just for educational purposes. Niederer is more interested in creating detailed replicas of people\u2019s hearts using computers. These \u201cdigital twins\u201d are the same size and shape as the real thing. They work in the same way. But they exist only virtually. Scientists can do virtual surgery on these virtual hearts, figuring out the best course of action for a patient\u2019s condition.

    "After decades of research, models like these are now entering clinical trials and starting to be used for patient care. Virtual replicas of many other organs are also being developed. Engineers are working on digital twins of people\u2019s brains, guts, livers, nervous systems, and more. They\u2019re creating virtual replicas of people\u2019s faces, which could be used to try out surgeries or analyze facial features, and testing drugs on digital cancers. The eventual goal is to create digital versions of our bodies\u2014computer copies that could help researchers and doctors figure out our risk of developing various diseases and determine which treatments might work best. They\u2019d be our own personal guinea pigs for testing out medicines before we subject our real bodies to them.",
    "To engineers like Niederer, it\u2019s a tantalizing prospect very much within reach. Several pilot studies have been completed, and larger trials are underway. Those in the field expect digital twins based on organs to become a part of clinical care within the next five to 10 years, aiding diagnosis and surgical decision-making. Further down the line, we\u2019ll even be able to run clinical trials on synthetic patients\u2014virtual bodies created using real data. But the budding technology will need to be developed carefully. Some worry about who will own this highly personalized data and how it could be used. Others fear for patient autonomy\u2014with an uncomplicated virtual record to consult, will doctors eventually bypass the patients themselves? And some simply feel a visceral repulsion at the idea of attempts to re-create humans in silico. \u201cPeople will say \u2018I don\u2019t want you copying me,\u2019\u201d says Wahbi El-Bouri, who is working on digital-twin technologies. \u201cThey feel it\u2019s a part of them that you\u2019ve taken.\u201d",
    "Getting digital Digital twins are well established in other realms of engineering; for example, they have long been used to model machinery and infrastructure. The term may have become a marketing buzzword lately, but for those working on health applications, it means something very specific.\u00a0 We can think of a digital twin as having three separate components, says El-Bouri, a biomedical engineer at the University of Liverpool in the UK. The first is the thing being modeled. That might be a jet engine or a bridge, or it could be a person\u2019s heart. Essentially, it\u2019s what we want to test or study.  The second component is the digital replica of that object, which can be created by taking lots of measurements from the real thing and entering them into a computer. For a heart, that might mean blood pressure recordings as well as MRI and CT scans. The third is new data that\u2019s fed into the model. A true digital twin should be updated in real time\u2014for example, with information collected from wearable sensors, if it\u2019s a model of someone\u2019s heart.  Taking measurements of airplanes and bridges is one thing. It\u2019s much harder to get a continuous data feed from a person, especially when you need details about the inner functions of the heart or brain.  And the information transfer should run both ways. Just as sensors can deliver data from a person\u2019s heart, the computer can model potential outcomes to make predictions and feed them back to a patient or health-care provider. A medical team might want to predict how a person will respond to a drug, for example, or test various surgical procedures on a digital model before operating in real life.

    "By this definition, pretty much any smart device that tracks some aspect of your health could be considered a kind of rudimentary digital twin. \u201cYou could say that an Apple Watch fulfills the definition of a digital twin in an unexciting way,\u201d says Niederer. \u201cIt tells you if you\u2019re in atrial fibrillation or not.\u201d\u00a0 But the kind of digital twin that researchers like Niederer are working on is far more intricate and detailed. It could provide specific guidance on which disease risks a person faces, what medicines might be most effective, or how any surgeries should proceed.",
    "Advertisement We\u2019re not quite there yet. Taking measurements of airplanes and bridges is one thing. It\u2019s much harder to get a continuous data feed from a person, especially when you need details about the inner functions of the heart or brain, says Niederer. As things stand, engineers are technically creating \u201cpatient-specific models\u201d based on previously collected hospital and research data, which is not continually updated.\u00a0 The most advanced medical digital twins are those built to match human hearts. These were the first to be attempted, partly because the heart is essentially a pump\u2014a device familiar to engineers\u00ad\u2014and partly because heart disease is responsible for so much ill health and death, says El-Bouri. Now, advances in imaging technology and computer processing power are enabling researchers to mimic the organ with the level of fidelity that clinical applications require.\u00a0 Building a heart The first step to building a digital heart is to collect images of the real thing. Each team will have its own slightly different approach, but generally, they all start with MRI and CT scans of a person\u2019s heart. These can be entered into computer software to create a 3D movie. Some scans will also highlight any areas of damaged tissue, which might disrupt the way the electrical pulses that control heart muscle contraction travel through the organ. The next step is to break this 3D model down into tiny chunks. Engineers use the term \u201ccomputational mesh\u201d to describe the result; it can look like an image of the heart made up of thousands of 3D pieces. Each segment represents a small collection of cells and can be assigned properties based on how well they are expected to propagate an electrical impulse. \u201cIt\u2019s all equations,\u201d says Natalia Trayanova, a biomedical engineering professor based at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.",
    "This computer model of the human heart show how electrical signals pass through heart tissue. The model was created by Marina Strocchi, who works with Steven Niederer at Imperial College London.COURTESY OF MARINA STROCCHI  As things stand, these properties involve some approximation. Engineers will guess how well each bit of heart works by extrapolating from previous studies of human hearts or past research on the disease the person has. The end result is a beating, pumping model of a real heart. \u201cWhen we have that model, you can poke it and prod it and see under what circumstances stuff will happen,\u201d says Trayanova. Her digital twins are already being trialed to help people with atrial fibrillation, a fairly common condition that can trigger an irregular heartbeat\u2014too fast or all over the place. One treatment option is to burn off the bits of heart tissue responsible for the disrupted rhythm. It\u2019s usually left to a surgical team to figure out which bits to target. For Trayanova, the pokes and prods are designed to help surgeons with that decision. Scans might highlight a few regions of damaged or scarred tissue. Her team can then construct a digital twin to help locate the underlying source of the damage. In total, the tool will likely suggest two or three regions to destroy\u2014though in rare instances, it has shown many more, says Trayanova: \u201cThey just have to trust us.\u201d So far, 59 people have been through the trial. More are planned.\u00a0 In cases like these, the models don\u2019t always need to be continually updated, Trayanova says. A heart surgeon might need to run simulations only to know where to implant a device, for example. Once that operation is over, no more data might be needed, she says.",
    "Quasi patients At his lab on the campus of Hammersmith Hospital in London, Niederer has also been building virtual hearts. He is exploring whether his models could be used to find the best place to implant pacemakers. His approach is similar to Trayanova\u2019s, but his models also incorporate ECG data from patients. These recordings give a sense of how electrical pulses pass through the heart tissue, he says. So far, Niederer and his colleagues have published a small trial in which models of 10 patients\u2019 hearts were evaluated by doctors but not used to inform surgical decisions. Still, Niederer is already getting requests from device manufacturers to run virtual tests of their products. A couple have asked him to choose places where their battery-operated pacemaker devices can sit without bumping into heart tissue, he says. Not only can Niederer and his colleagues run this test virtually, but they can do it for hearts of various different sizes. The team can test the device in hundreds of potential locations, within hundreds of different virtual hearts. \u201cAnd we can do it in a week,\u201d he adds. Advertisement This is an example of what scientists call \u201cin silico trials\u201d\u2014clinical trials run on a computer. In some cases, it\u2019s not just the trials that are digital. The volunteers are, too. El-Bouri and his colleagues are working on ways to create \u201csynthetic\u201d participants for their clinical trials. The team starts with data collected from real people and uses this to create all-new digital organs with a mishmash of characteristics from the real volunteers.\u00a0   These in silico trials could be especially useful for helping us figure out the best treatments for pregnant people\u2014a group that is notoriously excluded from many clinical trials.  Specifically, one of El-Bouri\u2019s interests is stroke, a medical emergency in which clots or bleeds prevent blood flow in parts of the brain. For their research, he and his colleagues model the brain, along with the blood vessels that feed it. \u201cYou could create lots and lots of different shapes and sizes of these brains based on patient data,\u201d says El-Bouri. Once he and his team create a group of synthetic patient brains, they can test how these clots might change the flow of blood or oxygen, or how and where brain tissue is affected. They can test the impact of certain drugs, or see what might happen if a stent is used to remove the blockage. For another project, El-Bouri is creating synthetic retinas. From a starting point of 100 or so retinal scans from real people, his team can generate 200 or more synthetic eyes, \u201cjust like that,\u201d he says. The trick is to figure out the math behind the distribution of blood vessels and re-create it through a set of algorithms. Now he is hoping to use those synthetic eyes in drug trials\u2014among other things, to find the best treatment doses for people with age-related macular degeneration, a common condition that can lead to blindness.",

    "These in silico trials could be especially useful for helping us figure out the best treatments for pregnant people\u2014a group that is notoriously excluded from many clinical trials. That\u2019s for fear that an experimental treatment might harm a fetus, says Michelle Oyen, a professor of biomedical engineering at Wayne State University in Detroit. Oyen is creating digital twins of pregnancy. It\u2019s a challenge to get the information needed to feed the models; during pregnancy, people are generally advised to avoid scans or invasive investigations they don\u2019t need. \u201cWe\u2019re much more limited in terms of the data that we can get,\u201d she says. Her team does make use of ultrasound images, including a form of ultrasound that allows the team to measure blood flow. From those images, they can see how blood flow in the uterus and the placenta, the organ that supports a fetus, might be linked to the fetus\u2019s growth and development, for example.",
    "For now, Oyen and her colleagues aren\u2019t creating models of the fetuses themselves\u2014they\u2019re focusing on the fetal environment, which includes the placenta and uterus. A baby needs a healthy, functioning placenta in order to survive; if the organ starts to fail, stillbirth can be the tragic outcome.\u00a0 Oyen is working on ways to monitor the placenta in real time during pregnancy. These readings could be fed back to a digital twin. If she can find a way to tell when the placenta is failing, doctors might be able to intervene to save the baby, she says. \u201cI think this is a game changer for pregnancy research,\u201d she adds, \u201cbecause this basically gives us ways of doing research in pregnancy that [carries a minimal] risk of harm to the fetus or of harm to the mother.\u201d In another project, the team is looking at the impact of cesarean section scars on pregnancies. When a baby is delivered by C-section, surgeons cut through multiple layers of tissue in the abdomen, including the uterus. Scars that don\u2019t heal well become weak spots in the uterus, potentially causing problems for future pregnancies. By modeling these scars in digital twins, Oyen hopes to be able to simulate how future pregnancies might pan out, and determine if or when specialist care might be called for. Eventually, Oyen wants to create a full virtual replica of the pregnant uterus, fetus and all. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet\u2014we\u2019re decades behind the cardiovascular people,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s pregnancy research in a nutshell,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re always decades behind.\u201d Advertisement Twinning It\u2019s all very well to generate virtual body parts, but the human body functions as a whole. That\u2019s why the grand plan for digital twins involves replicas of entire people. \u201cLong term, the whole body would be fantastic,\u201d says El-Bouri. It may not be all that far off, either. Various research teams are already building models of the heart, brain, lungs, kidneys, liver, musculoskeletal system, blood vessels, immune system, eye, ear, and more. \u201cIf we were to take every research group that works on digital twins across the world at the moment, I think you could put [a body] together,\u201d says El-Bouri. \u201cI think there\u2019s even someone working on the tongue,\u201d he adds.\u00a0 The challenge is bringing together all the various researchers, with the different approaches and different code involved in creating and using their models, says El-Bouri. \u201cEverything exists,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just putting it together that\u2019s going to be the issue.\u201d In theory, such whole-body twins could revolutionize health care. Trayanova envisions a future in which a digital twin is just another part of a person\u2019s medical record\u2014one that a doctor can use to decide on a course of treatment.",
    "\u201cTechnically, if someone tried really hard, they might be able to piece back who someone is through scans and twins of organs.\u201d Wahbi El-Bouri But El-Bouri says he receives mixed reactions to the idea. Some people think it\u2019s \u201creally exciting and really cool,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s also met people who are strongly opposed to the idea of having a virtual copy of themselves exist on a computer somewhere: \u201cThey don\u2019t want any part of that.\u201d Researchers need to make more of an effort to engage with the public to find out how people feel about the technology, he says. There are also concerns over patient autonomy. If a doctor has access to a patient\u2019s digital twin and can use it to guide decisions about medical care, where does the patient\u2019s own input come into the equation? Some of those working to create digital twins point out that the models could reveal whether patients have taken their daily meds or what they\u2019ve eaten that week. Will clinicians eventually come to see digital twins as a more reliable source of information than people\u2019s self-reporting? Doctors should not be allowed to bypass patients and just \u201cask the machine,\u201d says Matthias Braun, a social ethicist at the University of Bonn in Germany. \u201cThere would be no informed consent, which would infringe on autonomy and maybe cause harm,\u201d he says. After all, we are not machines with broken parts. Two individuals with the same diagnosis can have very different experiences and lead very different lives.\u00a0 Related StoryWhy the sci-fi dream of cryonics never diedThe idea that humans could be frozen and later brought back has survived for decades. The hope is still alive and even growing today\u2014never mind that it\u2019s still not possible.",
    "However, there are cases in which patients are not able to make decisions about their own treatment\u2014for example, if they are unconscious. In those cases, clinicians try to find a proxy\u2014someone authorized to make decisions on the patient\u2019s behalf. A digital psychological twin, trained on a person\u2019s medical data and digital footprint, could potentially act as a better surrogate than, for example, a relative who doesn\u2019t know the person\u2019s preferences, he says.  If using digital twins in patient care is problematic, in silico trials can also raise issues. Jantina de Vries, an ethicist at the University of Cape Town, points out that the data used to create digital twins and synthetic \u201cquasi patients\u201d will come from people who can be scanned, measured, and monitored. This group is unlikely to include many of those living on the African continent, who won\u2019t have ready access to those technologies. \u201cThe problem of data scarcity directly translates into technologies that \u2026 are not geared to think about diverse bodies,\u201d she says. De Vries thinks the data should belong to the public in order to ensure that as many people benefit from digital-twin technologies as possible. Every record should be anonymized and kept within a public database that researchers around the world can access and make use of, she says.\u00a0 AdvertisementThe people who participate in Trayanova\u2019s trials \u201cexplicitly give me consent to know their data, and to know who they are \u2026 [everything] about them,\u201d she says.\u00a0 The people taking part in Niederer\u2019s research also provide consent for their data to be used by the medical and research teams. But while clinicians have access to all medical data, researchers access only anonymized or pseudonymized data, Niederer says.\u00a0 In some cases, researchers will also ask participants to consent to sharing their fully anonymized data in public repositories. This is the only data that companies are able to access, he adds: \u201cWe do not share [our] data sets outside of the research or medical teams, and we do not share them with companies.\u201d\u00a0 El-Bouri thinks that patients should receive some form of compensation in exchange for sharing their health data. Perhaps they should get preferential access to medications and devices based on that data, he suggests. At any rate, \u201c[full] anonymization is tricky, particularly if you\u2019re taking patient scans to develop twins,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnically, if someone tried really hard, they might be able to piece back who someone is through scans and twins of organs.\u201d When I looked at those anonymous plastic hearts, stored in a cardboard box tucked away on a shelf in the corner of an office, they felt completely divorced from the people whose real, beating hearts they were modeled on. But digital twins seem different somehow. They\u2019re animated replicas, digital copies that certainly appear to have some sort of life. \u201cPeople often think, Oh, this is just a simulation,\u201d says El-Bouri. \u201cBut it\u2019s a digital representation of an individual.\u201d"
