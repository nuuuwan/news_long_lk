# Research: Warehouse and Logistics Automation Works Better with Human Partners

## Summary ðŸ¤–

Facts:
- A global study suggests that blending human labor with robotics in warehouses and logistics companies leads to greater efficiency than full automation alone.
- Despite scalable robotic systems being able to handle up to 1,000 tasks per hour, they often face limitations beyond which additional robots donâ€™t enhance performance.
- Human-robot collaboration employed by companies like DHL and CEVA helps to increase productivity, reduce worker fatigue, and increase job satisfaction.
- The approach of integrating human roles with automated systems not only makes the operations cost-effective but also leverages human adaptability for continuous improvements.
- The worldwide market revenue for robotics automation in warehouses and distribution is projected to grow from $7.91 billion in 2021 to more than $51 billion by 2030, according to Statista.

Opinions:
- The study implies that human-robot collaboration in warehouse and logistics operations is a more effective method than full automation.
- It suggests that even as robotic automation is on the rise, the importance and efficiency of human labor should not be overlooked.
- The authors opine that operations can remain cost-effective through the integration of human roles with automated systems, which also allows for the utilization of human adaptability for constant improvements.

A study of automation usage in warehouse and logistics companies around the world suggests that blending human labor with robotics leads to greater efficiency than full automation alone. While scalable robotic systems can handle up to 1,000 tasks per hour, they often face limitations where additional robots donâ€™t improve performance. Human-robot collaboration, employed by companies like DHL and CEVA, enhances productivity, reduces worker fatigue, and increases job satisfaction. The incremental approach of integrating human roles with automated systems not only keeps operations cost effective but also leverages human adaptability for continuous improvements.

In every sphere of business, the use of automation is growing. In warehouses and distribution, for instance, the worldwide market revenue for robotics automation is projected to grow from $7.91 billion in 2021 to more than $51 billion by 2030, according to one Statista forecast.
