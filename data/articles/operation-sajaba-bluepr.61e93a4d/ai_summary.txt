The leaders of Sri Lanka's United National Party (UNP) are devising a plan to entice the majority of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party's members to join the UNP. This plan, codenamed "Operation Sajaba" by a senior UNP member, is meant to rejuvenate the party by bringing back "prodigal sons and daughters" who previously left for the SJB. However, SJB leader Sajith Premadasa has denied allegations that his party members are considering defecting and accused the government of offering financial incentives to SJB members to join their ranks.
