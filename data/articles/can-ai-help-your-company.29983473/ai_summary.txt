1. 🏢Companies need to find ways to innovate quickly, cheaply, and productively, and many are considering AI for this purpose. 🤔
2. 📚Two studies were done to understand how AI contributes to innovation; a survey on process improvement and new technology development across 331 firms and patent data analysis from more than 2,000 public firms. 📄
3. 🤖AI has shown to be beneficial for process innovation and diverse recombination - a type of innovation where different technology elements are combined in new ways.💡
4. 📈Firms using AI analytics for wide recombination are 3 to 7% more productive compared to those that do not. 🏆
5. 🔄Advanced AI can boost firm innovation further when a firm’s existing knowledge is well-distributed, resulting in about three more new patents annually. 🎯
6. 🚫However, AI is less effective for incremental innovation or small improvements to existing products and doesn't significantly help with radical innovation. 🛑
7. 🕰️ Over time, products can become outdated, and it's crucial for companies to constantly innovate to prevent this. 🔄
8. 🚑 Failing to innovate can turn a leading company into a laggard due to the lengthy product development timelines of modern complex products. 📉
9. 📘Among some reading suggestions is a book titled "The AI-Savvy Leader: Nine Ways to Take Back Control and Make AI Work" which could prove helpful in the matter. 👀
10. 💼 The goal is for leaders to recognize when a product line needs a refresh and to utilize tools like AI to facilitate this process. 🌐.
