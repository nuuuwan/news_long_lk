    "An old lady selling Kavum (Oil Cake) in Pettah, The proposed economic policies aim to support small-scale entrepreneurs like her. Pix by Nisal Baduge",
    "The tax base should be expanded by curbing tax evasion and implementing a progressive tax structure that ensures equity",
    "The government should prioritise spending on essential sectors like healthcare, education, and infrastructure while reducing wastage and corruption",
    "Agriculture remains a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. Modernising this sector can enhance productivity and ensure food security",
    "Sri Lanka stands at crossroads in its economic history. Following a series of financial challenges, the country requires a robust and comprehensive policy framework to stimulate recovery and ensure long-term prosperity. This article outlines a multi-pronged approach that integrates fiscal discipline, structural reforms, social equity, and sustainable development.",
    "Fiscal Stability and Macroeconomic Management",
    "Achieving fiscal stability is paramount for restoring investor confidence and reducing the country\u2019s debt burden. This involves a comprehensive approach that addresses both short-term financial challenges and long-term economic sustainability.",
    "One of the key measures is Debt Restructuring. It is important to foster collaboration with international financial institutions (IFIs) and creditors to restructure external debt while negotiating favourable terms. This includes extending repayment timelines, reducing interest rates, and potentially securing partial debt forgiveness to ease the financial burden. Developing a transparent and credible repayment plan will also boost confidence among stakeholders.",
    "Tax reforms should also be implemented. Expand the tax base by curbing tax evasion and implementing a progressive tax structure that ensures equity. Introducing modern tax collection systems, leveraging technology, and incentivising compliance through transparent and fair policies can further enhance revenue. A comprehensive review of tax exemptions and incentives is necessary to avoid revenue leakages.",
    "Expenditure rationalisation is also key. The government should prioritise spending on essential sectors like healthcare, education, and infrastructure while reducing wastage and corruption. Establishing a centralised procurement system and conducting regular audits of government projects can ensure efficient allocation of resources. Furthermore, redirecting subsidies to target only the most vulnerable groups will help optimise public spending.",
    "A robust monetary policy is crucial. This can be achieved by strengthening the Central Bank\u2019s independence to manage inflation and stabilise the currency through prudent monetary policies. This includes maintaining appropriate interest rates, building foreign reserves, and managing currency exchange rates to support both domestic and international trade. A robust inflation-targeting framework can be adopted to ensure price stability.",
    "Legislation of fiscal responsibility is also necessary, in particular, The government should introduce or strengthen laws that set clear limits on budget deficits and public debt to ensure disciplined fiscal management. Such frameworks can create accountability and prevent future financial crises. An independent fiscal council should be established to monitor compliance and provide policy recommendations that can enhance credibility.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery hinges on bolstering its export sector. A well-structured export-led growth strategy can address trade imbalances, create jobs, and generate foreign exchange",
    "There should be proper public debt management, this can be achieved by developing a comprehensive public debt management strategy to align borrowing with development priorities. There should be diversification in funding sources by exploring domestic bond markets and green financing opportunities while maintaining transparency in debt reporting.",
    "Promoting Export-Led Growth",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery hinges on bolstering its export sector. A well-structured export-led growth strategy can address trade imbalances, create jobs, and generate foreign exchange.",
    "There are many strategies to approach this. One way is to diversify exports. There should be a reduction in the dependence on traditional commodities like tea and garments by promoting high-value sectors such as Information and Communications Technology (ICT), pharmaceuticals, and value-added agriculture. Also, niche markets should be identified where Sri Lanka can develop a competitive advantage and invest in branding and marketing these products globally.",
    "We should also utilise trade agreements, this can be done by leveraging bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to access new markets and improve competitiveness. Pursue regional partnerships, such as with SAARC or ASEAN, to integrate into broader trade networks and secure preferential trading terms.",
    "Strengthening value chains in export-oriented industries by investing in processing facilities, quality assurance systems, and certification programmes that meet global standards is key. This ensures that Sri Lankan products are competitive in international markets.",
    "The establishment of dedicated export financing mechanisms to provide working capital and credit facilities to exporters is necessary. Encourage financial institutions to develop products tailored to the needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engaged in exports.",
    "Improving ease of doing business is also important, this can be done by streamlining regulatory processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and enhancing transparency to attract both local and foreign investors. Implementing single-window systems for export-related approvals can significantly reduce delays and costs.",
    "There should also be a focus on Infrastructure Development by investing in logistics and transportation infrastructure, including ports, airports, and road networks, to facilitate the efficient movement of goods. Modernising customs procedures and adopting digital solutions can further enhance trade efficiency.",
    "Promotion of services exports should also be implemented by expanding into service exports, particularly in ICT, education, tourism, and healthcare. Sri Lanka should position itself as a hub for knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and other high-value service sectors to diversify foreign exchange earnings.",
    "Revitalising the Agricultural Sector",
    "Agriculture remains a cornerstone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. Modernising this sector can enhance productivity and ensure food security:",
    "One way to do this is to provide farmers access to modern farming techniques, equipment, and digital platforms to improve productivity and efficiency. Promote precision agriculture using data-driven tools such as satellite imagery, sensors, and AI-based analytics to optimise resource use and increase yields.",
    "Also, some improvements can be made to the supply chain, by investing in storage, transportation, and distribution networks to minimise post-harvest losses. Establish cold chain facilities and improve rural road connectivity to link farmers with markets more effectively. Develop cooperatives to empower small-scale farmers to achieve better economies of scale.",
    "There should also be encouragement in sustainable and climate-resilient farming methods, such as agroforestry, crop diversification, and organic farming. Provide training and incentives for farmers to adopt water-saving irrigation techniques like drip and sprinkler systems. Introduce crop insurance schemes to protect farmers against climate-induced risks such as floods and droughts. Also, there should be implementation of supportive policies such as subsidised loans, grants for modern equipment, and guaranteed minimum price schemes to protect farmers\u2019 incomes. Establish agricultural research and extension services to disseminate best practices and innovations.",
    "Fostering Human Capital Development",
    "A skilled and healthy workforce is essential for sustainable growth. Efforts should include: education reform, which can be done by aligning curricula with market needs, emphasising STEM education, vocational training, and soft skills development. Strengthening early childhood education is fundamental to laying a solid foundation for future learning. Introduce digital literacy and coding skills as core subjects in schools to prepare the workforce for the demands of a globalised and technology-driven economy. Collaborate with private sector stakeholders to ensure education and training programmes address current and future industry needs.",
    "Then there is the topic of youth and gender empowerment, this can be done by implementing policies that encourage youth entrepreneurship through access to funding, mentorship programmes, and business development training. Youth innovation hubs should be established, and incubation services should be provided to nurture start-ups. Improving women\u2019s participation in the labour force should be done by addressing barriers such as wage gaps, inadequate childcare facilities, and cultural norms. Promote gender equality through targeted skill development programmes and leadership training initiatives.",
    "Leveraging Technology and Innovation",
    "Innovation is the driving force behind modern economic transformations. Sri Lanka must invest in R&D by increasing public and private sector spending on research and development to foster innovation, establish innovation hubs and strengthen collaboration between universities and industries to accelerate the commercialisation of new technologies.",
    "There should also be Digital Transformation by expanding internet penetration and digital literacy to integrate more citizens into the digital economy. Also, the Modernisation of public services through e-governance platforms to improve efficiency and accessibility is key. There should also be development in smart city initiatives using data-driven urban management and sustainability technologies.",
    "Sustainable and Inclusive Development",
    "Sustainable and inclusive development is a key pillar for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery and long-term prosperity. It ensures that economic growth benefits all segments of society while preserving the environment for future generations. Here\u2019s how this can be elaborated:",
    "The government must focus on creating an economy that benefits all social classes, particularly the marginalised. This includes rural development, support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and equitable distribution of resources. Ensuring access to economic opportunities for women, youth, and other disadvantaged groups is crucial.",
    "There should be employment creation also, which can be done by promoting industries that can create jobs in the local economy. Skill development programmes should target underrepresented communities, especially women and youth, to ensure they can participate meaningfully in the economy.",
    "Strengthening Governance and Transparency",
    "Transparency is an essential principle in governance, particularly for economic recovery and the sustainable development of a country like Sri Lanka. It involves openness, accountability, and clarity in government actions, decision-making, and the use of public resources. A transparent system builds trust between the government and citizens, encourages investment, and promotes fairness. Here\u2019s a look at the importance of transparency in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery:",
    "There should also be a boost in investor confidence which can be addressed by increasing transparency in regulatory frameworks, tax policies, and legal structure which is essential for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Investors are more likely to invest in a country where the rules are clear, predictable, and applied fairly. In Sri Lanka, this is particularly important as the country seeks to recover economically and build a competitive economy.",
    "Also, increasing transparency will support the monitoring and evaluation of government programmes and projects. By publicly sharing data on the effectiveness of different initiatives, the government can ensure that public spending delivers tangible benefits. It also allows for adjustments to be made where projects are not meeting their intended goals.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s path to economic recovery and prosperity requires a holistic approach that addresses immediate challenges while laying the foundation for long-term growth. By fostering fiscal discipline, enhancing competitiveness, empowering people, and committing to sustainable practices, the nation can rebuild its economy and secure a brighter future for its citizens.",
