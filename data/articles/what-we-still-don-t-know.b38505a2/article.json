    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY MIT Technology Review\u00a0Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what\u2019s coming next. You can read\u00a0more from the series here. Weight-loss drugs have been back in the news this week. First, we heard that Eli Lilly, the company behind the drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, became the first healthcare company in the world to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation.  Those two drugs, which are prescribed for diabetes and obesity respectively, are\u00a0generating billions of dollars in revenue for the company. Other GLP-1 agonist drugs\u2014a class that includes Mounjaro and Zepbound, which have the same active ingredient\u2014have also been approved to\u00a0reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in overweight people. Many hope these apparent wonder drugs will also treat neurological disorders and potentially substance use disorders, too. Related StoryWe\u2019re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the bodyRead next But this week we also learned that, disappointingly,\u00a0GLP-1 drugs don\u2019t seem to help people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And that people who stop taking the drugs when they become pregnant can experience potentially dangerous levels of weight gain during their pregnancies. On top of that, some researchers worry that people are using the drugs postpartum to lose pregnancy weight without understanding potential risks.",
    "All of this news should serve as a reminder that there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about these drugs. This week, let\u2019s look at the enduring questions surrounding GLP-1 agonist drugs. First a quick recap. Glucagon-like peptide-1 is a hormone made in the gut that helps regulate blood sugar levels. But we\u2019ve learned that it also appears to have effects across the body. Receptors that GLP-1 can bind to have been found in multiple organs and throughout the brain, says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto who has been studying the hormone for decades.",
    "GLP-1 agonist drugs essentially mimic the hormone\u2019s action. Quite a few have been developed, including semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, and exenatide, which have brand names like Ozempic, Saxenda and Wegovy. Some of them are recommended for some people with diabetes. Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI.

But because these drugs also seem to suppress appetite, they have become hugely popular weight loss aids. And studies have found that many people who take them for diabetes or weight loss experience surprising side effects; that\u00a0their mental health improves, for example, or that\u00a0they feel less inclined to smoke or consume alcohol. Research has also found that the drugs seem to increase the growth of brain cells in lab animals. So far, so promising. But there are a few outstanding gray areas. Are they good for our brains?  Novo Nordisk, a competitor of Eli Lilly, manufactures GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Saxenda. The company recently trialed an oral semaglutide in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease who had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The placebo-controlled trial included 3808 volunteers.

What about humans?Read next Unfortunately, the company found that the drug did not appear to delay the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the volunteers who took it. The news came as a huge disappointment to the research community. \u201cIt was kind of crushing,\u201d says Drucker. That\u2019s despite the fact that, deep down, he wasn\u2019t expecting a \u201cclear win.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease has proven notoriously difficult to treat, and by the time people get a diagnosis, a lot of damage has already taken place. But he is one of many that isn\u2019t giving up hope entirely. After all, research suggests that GLP-1 reduces inflammation in the brain and improves the health of neurons, and that it appears to improve the way brain regions communicate with each other. This all implies that GLP-1 drugs should benefit the brain, says Drucker. There\u2019s still a chance that the drugs might help stave off Alzheimer\u2019s in those who are still cognitively healthy.",
    "Are they safe before, during or after pregnancy? Other research published this week raises questions about the effects of GLP-1s taken around the time of pregnancy. At the moment, people are advised to plan to stop taking the medicines two months before they become pregnant. That\u2019s partly because some animal studies suggest the drugs can harm the development of a fetus, but mainly because scientists haven\u2019t studied the impact on pregnancy in humans. Among the broader population, research suggests that many people who take GLP-1s for weight loss\u00a0regain much of their lost weight once they stop taking those drugs. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that\u00a0a study published in JAMA earlier this week saw a similar effect in pregnant people. The study found that people who had been taking those drugs gained around 3.3kg more than others who had not. And those who had been taking the drugs also appeared to have a slightly higher risk of gestational diabetes, blood pressure disorders and even preterm birth. Related StoryWhy the term \"women of childbearing age\" is problematicRead next It sounds pretty worrying. But\u00a0a different study published in August had the opposite finding\u2014it noted a reduction in the risk of those outcomes among women who had taken the drugs before becoming pregnant. If you\u2019re wondering how to make sense of all this, you\u2019re not the only one. No one really knows how these drugs should be used before pregnancy\u2014or during it for that matter. Another\u00a0study out this week found that people (in Denmark) are increasingly taking GLP-1s postpartum to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Drucker tells me that, anecdotally, he gets asked about this potential use a lot. But there\u2019s a lot going on in a postpartum body. It\u2019s a time of huge physical and hormonal change that can include bonding, breastfeeding and even a rewiring of the brain. We have no idea if, or how, GLP-1s might affect any of those.",
    "How\u2014and when\u2014can people safely stop using them? Yet\u00a0another study out this week\u2014you can tell GLP-1s are one of the hottest topics in medicine right now\u2014looked at what happens when people stop taking tirzepatide (marketed as Zepbound) for their obesity.",
    "The trial participants all took the drug for 36 weeks, at which point half continued with the drug, and half were switched to a placebo for another 52 weeks. During that first 36 weeks, the weight and heart health of the participants improved. Related StoryWhen you lose weight, where does it go?Read next But by the end of the study, most of those that had switched to a placebo had regained more than 25% of the weight they had originally lost. One in four had regained more than 75% of that weight, and 9% ended up at a higher weight than when they\u2019d started the study. Their heart health also worsened. Does that mean that people need to take these drugs forever? Scientists don\u2019t have the answer to that one, either. Or if taking the drugs indefinitely is safe. The answer might depend on the individual, their age or health status, or what they are using the drug for. There are other gray areas. GLP-1s look promising for substance use disorders, but we don\u2019t yet know how effective they might be. We don\u2019t know the long-term effects these drugs have on children who take them. And we don\u2019t know the long-term consequences these drugs might have for healthy-weight people who take them for weight loss. Earlier this year, Drucker accepted a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences at\u00a0a glitzy event in California. \u201cAll of these Hollywood celebrities were coming up to me and saying \u2018thank you so much,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of these people don\u2019t need to be on these medicines.\u201d This article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.
