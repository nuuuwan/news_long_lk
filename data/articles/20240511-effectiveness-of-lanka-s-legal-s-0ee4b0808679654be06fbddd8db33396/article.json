    "This fact was patently clear on many occasions in several incidents.

    "Classic example\u00a0",
    "There is another classic example that the IMF had urged Sri Lanka to strengthen tax administration, scrap exemptions, and stamp out evasion to boost revenue and signal better governance. The failure to sign a staff-level agreement in the first review following the bailout package could delay the release of the second tranche of funds. The main reason was that the present government has been unable to pass a trustworthy law which can prevent corruption in the country.\u00a0\u00a0",

Accordingly, it has been revealed that a company that typically imported 2,000 metric tons of sugar monthly importing 10,000 metric tons in October 2023 just before the tax increase, reaped substantial gains as the tax jumped 200-fold from 25 cents to 50 Rupees.\u00a0",
    "During the Gotabaya regime, the contract to construct the Light Rail Transport Project was granted to the Japanese government and the abrupt cancellation of the said tenders awarded to them was yet another reason for the erosion of investor confidence.

    "According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\u00a0 top 1% of Sri Lankans own 31% of the total personal wealth in the country while the bottom 50% only own less than 4%. It also says that\u00a0 33.4% of the populace is grappling with vulnerability and deprivation concerning debt-related metrics.
