Executives today face a challenging dilemma: balancing an increased focus on shareholder engagement with the reality of declining shareholder loyalty. Too often, companies fail to understand their shareholders in the same as their customers and cultivate...more

Companies are dedicating increasing attention to investor relations (IR) management to cultivate shareholder loyalty. On average, CEOs allocate 15 days per year to IR activities — a notable commitment given the breadth of their responsibilities. In total, senior management spends 44 days annually on IR, with CFOs contributing the largest share (23 days), while other executives devote an average of six days.

Despite increased focus on IR activities, shareholders are shortening their holding periods in companies and exhibiting declining loyalty in portfolio companies. According to the World Economic Forum, the average holding period of shares was just 5.5 months as of June 2020, a sharp decline from the late 1950s peak of 8 years. Declining shareholder loyalty can pressure portfolio companies to deliver quick returns, which complicates executives’ efforts to design and implement corporate strategies. It appears that current shareholder engagement at many companies has been ineffective. Meanwhile, fostering shareholder loyalty is crucial, as a disloyal shareholder base can lead to volatile stock prices, undermining executives’ ability to make and execute strategic decisions effectively.

Why do most companies’ IR functions fall short? A key reason is that they often treat all shareholders as having the same preferences, resulting in a lack of the customization necessary to effectively engage different types of investors. If companies devoted as much effort to shareholder profiling as they do to customer profiling, they could significantly enhance shareholder engagement and cultivate stronger shareholder loyalty. Although adopting a 360-degree shareholder profiling approach could enable more targeted and personalized engagement strategies, companies have not yet adopted it.

What is Shareholder Profiling?

Shareholder profiling involves creating detailed representations of a company’s key shareholders by analyzing their decision-making patterns and behavioral data. The primary goal of shareholder profiling is to understand shareholders’ preferences, enabling companies to tailor their IR efforts accordingly and foster shareholder loyalty in the end.

Shareholder profiling differs from shareholder or investor intelligence. While shareholder intelligence focuses on tracking changes in a company’s shareholder base — such as the services provided by Georgeson, which monitor the ebb and flow of shareholder composition — shareholder profiling delves deeper into understanding shareholders’ preferences. Its aim is not only to build loyalty among current shareholders but also to attract potential loyal shareholders through customized engagement strategies.

The challenges Target faced in 2023 highlight the critical importance of shareholder profiling. The American Conservative Values ETF (ACVF), a fund catering to politically conservative investors, divested its holdings in Target and blacklisted the company, citing its LGBTQ-themed Pride merchandising as part of a “woke agenda” inconsistent with conservative values. This example underscores how misalignment with investor preferences can lead to reputational and financial setbacks. By implementing robust shareholder profiling, Target could have better anticipated such reactions and tailored its decisions to reflect the diverse values of its investor base.

Steps to Shareholder Profiling

Conducting shareholder profiling begins with gathering information about shareholders. Since institutional investors are the largest shareholders of most publicly traded companies in the U.S., shareholder profiling should prioritize these investors. Publicly available data on institutional investors is abundant and can be easily collected. By integrating this information, companies can create a comprehensive 360-degree investor profile to guide their engagement strategies effectively.

How they’re investing.

Institutional investors with assets under management exceeding $100 million are required to file SEC Form 13F quarterly, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. This filing must disclose the managers’ stock positions, providing transparency into their investment activities. In addition, if institutional investors acquire more than 5% of a voting class of securities, they are subject to further disclosure requirements. These filings make it easy to track portfolio changes in a timely manner.

The portfolio turnover rate of investors, calculated as the frequency of asset transactions within a portfolio, can offer insights into their investment horizons. For instance, a low turnover rate often indicates a long-term buy-and-hold strategy, while a high turnover rate suggests frequent trading and shorter investment horizons. Moreover, analyzing investors’ portfolio concentration across industries or firms with varying market capitalizations can reveal their risk preferences. For example, investors heavily concentrated in high-growth industries or firms with high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios typically exhibit higher risk tolerance. Conversely, those focused on low-growth industries or firms with low P/E ratios tend to have lower risk preferences.

In addition, the environmental and social performance ratings of portfolio firms can provide valuable information about investors’ preferences. For example, investors avoiding firms with poor environmental performance may prioritize immediate returns over long-term sustainability goals.

Institutional investors’ voting records are a valuable source of insight into their preferences and priorities. Research indicates that voting patterns on environmental and social proposals often reflect investors’ ideological leanings. Furthermore, voting behavior during proxy contests can reveal whether shareholders align more closely with company management or activist shareholders, providing a deeper understanding of their stance on corporate governance.

Who they’re representing.

Institutional investors manage money on behalf of their principals, making it critical to understand whom they represent. These investors differ in legal structure, encompassing mutual funds, public pension funds, private pensions, insurance companies, and endowments. These structural differences often shape their investment approaches and strategies. Failing to recognize who institutional investors represent can result in shareholder dissatisfaction and disloyalty. For instance, public pension funds are frequently subject to political influence, and university endowments may prioritize strategies that align with the preferences of students. Understanding these distinctions is essential for developing tailored IR strategies that foster long-term loyalty and strengthen relationships with institutional shareholders.

How they’re connecting.

Fund managers ultimately make investment decisions, and their social connections can play a significant role in shaping these decisions. For instance, fund managers who share a common educational background with a firm’s executives may leverage these networks to build stronger relationships and foster shareholder loyalty. In addition, fund managers’ connections with one another can provide insights into how they coordinate their actions. Moreover, political connections built through political contributions by fund managers can reveal their ideological leanings. For example, significant donations to Democratic versus Republican politicians may suggest a preference for liberal or conservative causes, respectively.

In some cases, integrating various aspects of shareholder information into a single, holistic profile may be essential. However, this process can present significant methodological challenges. Machine learning tools, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), can help overcome these hurdles. These tools enable companies to reduce the complexity of shareholder data while retaining as much variability and meaningful differentiation as possible across shareholders. By leveraging these techniques, firms can create comprehensive and actionable shareholder profiles to guide their investor relations strategies effectively.

A company’s IR function should go beyond managing communication with the investment community by developing expertise in gathering shareholder information and conducting shareholder profiling.

The Strategic Importance of Shareholder Profiling

Shareholder profiling is essential for fostering strong partnerships between shareholders and companies. By understanding shareholder preferences, companies can effectively develop shareholder loyalty. A well-executed shareholder profiling process allows companies to:

Identify aligned shareholders. A thorough understanding of the shareholder base is essential for identifying investors whose goals align with the company’s strategic objectives. For example, if corporate executives view sustainability as a critical driver of long-term competitiveness, they should focus on engaging institutional investors whose fund managers are inclined to support Democratic political candidates or vote in favor of shareholder proposals that promote environmental initiatives. Similarly, a company pursuing high-risk, growth-focused strategic investments may benefit from targeting shareholders who are growth-oriented and have long-term investment horizons.

Improve shareholder loyalty. Once aligned shareholders are identified, companies can tailor their IR strategies to engage effectively with these shareholders. Specifically, communication should be customized to align with shareholder preferences. For example, if shareholders have a long-term investment horizon, corporate executives should focus on explaining how their strategic decisions can strengthen a company’s long-term competitiveness. In addition, companies may need to understand the reasons behind large shareholders exiting their positions. Are these sales driven by portfolio rebalancing decisions, or are they a response to company-specific decisions? Gaining this insight can help firms refine their strategies and foster loyalty among shareholders.

Grow a loyal shareholder base. Shareholder profiling plays a vital role in expanding a company’s base of loyal shareholders. Misaligned shareholders — those whose priorities do not align with the company’s strategic goals — can pose challenges and, in some cases, risks to the firm. To mitigate this, companies should avoid over-investing resources in engaging these shareholders through IR efforts. Instead, by leveraging shareholder profiling, companies can identify aligned shareholders who not only support their strategic decisions but also assist them in making effective strategic decisions. Once these ideal investors are identified, firms can proactively attract them — such as through private placements — thereby cultivating a more strategically aligned and loyal shareholder base.

A comprehensive 360-degree shareholder profiling approach enables companies to identify investor preferences, anticipate potential risks, and engage shareholders more effectively. This strategy not only fosters stronger shareholder loyalty but also empowers firms to develop and implement corporate strategies that deliver long-term value to shareholders. In turn, this creates a positive feedback loop, strengthening the relationship between the company and its investors.
