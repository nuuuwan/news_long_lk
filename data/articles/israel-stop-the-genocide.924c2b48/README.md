Having been instrumental in the fall of Iraq, Libya and Syria, the US has long set its eyes on Iran, as the last major sovereign country remaining in the Middle East

Following is a statement by the People’s Struggle Alliance, on the ongoing US-sponsored genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel, and the political crisis unfolding in the Middle East

We condemn America’s attacks on Iran, as their most recent attempt at advancing their imperialist project in the Middle East, further escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. We also condemn Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran, in direct breach of international law, 11 days ago. Having been instrumental in the fall of Iraq, Libya and Syria, the US has long set its eyes on Iran, as the last major sovereign country remaining in the Middle East. The US has once again taken a page out of its own infamous playbook, by claiming that Iran is in possession of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu too has been ‘crying wolf’ about Iran’s nuclear capacity for the past 20 years.

In this context of an indefinite and fragile “ceasefire”, with Israel still attacking Iran and of course Gaza, we could face the very real threat of a world war – with the world’s nuclear powers, China, Russia and North Korea potentially allying with Iran, and the US-led imperialist powers consolidating with Israel. It is therefore integral for the Left across the world, to take a strong anti-war stance, as no war at any point in history has benefited the working class. On the contrary, it is the working class that is/has been most exploited, and made to bear the brunt of any war.

Ironically, the US, who has the second highest number of nuclear weapons in the world (5200+), and detonated two atomic bombs, is seen leading the charge against countries allegedly in possession of ‘nuclear weapons’ and/or ‘weapons of mass destruction’ in the Middle East. More than 55,000 Palestinians, including 18,000+ children, have been killed by the Israeli Government, since 7 October 2023. This death toll is not much less than the number of people instantly killed in Hiroshima (66,000), and more than the instant death toll in Nagasaki (39,000). So whilst the G7 is “concerned” about Iran’s alleged stash of nuclear weapons, over the course of the last 626 days, the death toll in Palestine is almost as much as the number of instant killings caused by the US detonated atomic bombs.

Following the US attacks on Iran, US President, Donald Trump, boasts of “successfully” “obliterating” three ‘nuclear sites’, congratulates the “great American warriors”, and then proclaims “now is the time for peace!” Whilst we are of the opinion that NO country in the world should be in the possession of nuclear weapons, we also do not look to the US to set the global political agenda, nor dictate the terms and conditions of war to the rest of the world.

We, as a Left political Alliance in Sri Lanka, recognise the State of Palestine, unequivocally stand with the people of Palestine, and reiterate their calls to stop the US imperialist project in Palestine, end the Israeli occupation and siege of Gaza, and stop the genocide.

Whilst we stand against the oppressive, genocidal actions of the State of Israel, we must also call out imperialist powers such as the UK, the EU, Germany, France and Canada, for their complicity in funding, arming and cheering on the livestreamed genocide of the Palestinian people! The deafening silence of the international mainstream media in particular, on all news related to Gaza and Free Palestine protests and actions, is not only appalling, but a direct breach of media freedom and accountability.

The Sri Lankan State has historically recognised the State of Palestine, and reiterate their calls to end the Israeli occupation, stop arming Israel and to free Palestine. With MPs from the current NPP Government being members of, and currently holding the post of Co-Chairman of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine (SLCSP), have yet to take a definitive, anti-imperialist position on Palestine. The Government seems to be attempting a balancing act, to both stand in solidarity with Palestine whilst simultaneously placating Israel and the US. This is by no means a political position the Sri Lankan State should hold in the face of an ongoing genocide.

Therefore, we call on the Government of Sri Lanka to;

Stop sending Sri Lankan workers to Israel, particularly as there are no measures in place to ensure that our citizens are not placed to work in illegally occupied territories or where they might be in direct danger of being injured or killed.

Take immediate measures to remove all unlawfully set up Israeli-owned businesses and chabad houses, spread across our southern and eastern coastal regions and other tourist spots in the country.

Stop providing public funded police security to chabad houses across the country. If they require protection, they are free to hire personnel from private security services.

Specifically instruct all tour operators and small scale guest house owners, etc., to stop offering “retreat packages” targeting IDF soldiers to vacation in Sri Lanka. Also to not provide employment opportunities to IDF soldiers during their stay here.

Strictly impose and regulate visas given to Israeli tourists, as many have overstayed for years, and unlawfully set up businesses and chabad houses here.

Take strict action against Israeli soldiers and tourists who have displayed aggressive and racist behaviour towards local and other foreign communities, especially within the surf community, as Sri Lanka is a popular surf destination attracting surfers from around the world.

Put an immediate stop to the distribution of Zionist propaganda such as flags, posters, flyers, clothing, etc. (including depictions of IDF soldiers on duty,) by Israeli business owners and tourists, in public spaces.

And we urge the international community to join our calls to;

The US, to stop the war in the Middle East!

Recognise the State of Palestinian!

End the Israeli occupation, and genocide in Gaza!

Call on all countries in possession of nuclear weapons, to sign onto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, with the intention of moving toward a world free of nuclear weapons!

Stand in solidarity with all people oppressed by the State of Iran, particularly its women, political dissidents in their ongoing resistance against the repressive Iranian regime, and in their fight against US imperialism.
