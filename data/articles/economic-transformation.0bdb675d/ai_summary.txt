The Economic Transformation Bill aims to organise Sri Lanka's governance and dive the country towards a competitive, export-oriented digital economy, according to an op-ed in the Daily FT. The proposed bill outlines numerous economic goals, such as increasing domestic production, reducing unemployment, integrating more with the global economy, and modernising the agriculture industry. This legislation also target reducing the national debt and increasing the female labour force participation. State Minister of Finance, Shehan Semasinghe, stated that the bill also includes targets that the government had already approved for reducing the country's debt. The op-ed suggests that the bill could be broken up into two sections or two bills - one focusing on economic parameters and the other on implementation methodologies. It concludes by urging other political parties to not only critique the bill but also provide their own proposals for economic transformation.
