The United National Party (UNP), Sri Lankaâ€™s oldest political party, lost the parliamentary elections in 2020. For the first time in its history, the UNP failed to get a single MP elected to Parliament, but was entitled to one national list MP by polling 249,435 (2.15%) of the votes. UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe re-entered Parliament as UNP national list MP on 23 June 2021. Wickremesinghe was appointed as Prime Minister on 12 May 2022 and took over as Acting President on 14 July 2022. His presidency was confirmed by parliament on 20 July 2022, when he received 134 out of 225 votes. Despite his efforts to entice MPs from the opposition, the opposition refused to co-operate. Wickremesinghe hopes for a future reunification of the UNP, stating his intention to reach out to members who had left the party.
