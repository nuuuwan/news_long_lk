    "It's been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT\u2019s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.\u00a0 As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.\u00a0  We did the math on AI\u2019s energy footprint. Here\u2019s the story you haven\u2019t heard. Understanding AI\u2019s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O\u2019Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI\u2019s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.",
    "We\u2019re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there\u2019s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.",
    "What is AI? Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven\u2019s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is\u2014and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology. Ethically sourced \u201cspare\u201d human bodies could revolutionize medicine In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can\u2019t think, don\u2019t have any awareness, and can\u2019t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such \u201cbodyoids,\u201d though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.\u00a0  It\u2019s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That\u2019s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we\u2019ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.\u00a0 Is this the electric grid of the future? The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that\u2019s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.",
    "Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that\u2019s over 30 years old This year saw the birth of the world\u2019s \u201coldest baby\u201d: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby\u2019s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian \u201cembryo adoption\u201d agency.\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryThe 8 worst technology flops of 2025Read nextHow these two brothers became go-to experts on America\u2019s \u201cmystery drone\u201d invasion Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat\u2014unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.\u00a0 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2025\u00a0 Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year\u2019s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We\u2019ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here\u2019s what didn\u2019t make the cut.)\u00a0\u00a0 hide"
