Facts:

- President Emmanuel Macron has called a snap parliamentary election in France hoping to unify centrist parties under his leadership to avoid a far-right Rassemblement National (RN) government.
- Macron's gamble is reliant on the willingness of centre-left and centre-right parties to work with his party, Renaissance.
- RN stands to gain power in two ways - either if they secure 289 out of 577 seats, leading to Macron inviting them to form a government, with Jordan Bardella as the prime minister, or if Bardella comes close to a majority, and Macron, unable to form a majority through alliances with other parties, appoints Bardella as PM.
- The decision to call a snap election took many within Renaissance by surprise, given the controversial policies and declining popularity that preceded it.
- Macron's popularity is low, leading Renaissance to ask him to step back from the election campaign. The campaign is currently spearheaded by Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal.
- RN, despite its lead in the polls, has refused alliances with the far-right party, Reconquête!, and Les Républicains has attempted to depose its leader for suggesting an alliance with RN.
- On the other hand, Nouveau front populaire (NFP), an alliance of left-wing parties from La France insoumise (LFI) to the centrist wing of the Parti socialiste (PS) is also an alternative.
- A centrist coalition including Renaissance, spanning the center-left to center-right, is another possible scenario that Macron was hoping for.
- The overall political situation in France is currently uncertain with three distinct scenarios plausible, each with its own potential issues.

Opinions:

- The author suggests Macron's decision to call a snap election was a major gamble that could backfire, given the uncertainty of the centre-left and centre-right parties' agreement to collaborate with Renaissance.
- The author implies that Macron underestimated the left's potential to emerge as a viable alternative to the far-right.
- Macron’s decision to dissolve parliament following the European elections (which he perceived as disastrous) and his use of the far-right's strength to coerce moderate parties into alliance is presented as a strategic risk by the author.
- The author suggests Macron's attempt to rush the election in hope of disrupting left-wing coordination was outmaneuvered by the swift formation of the NFP alliance.
- The author assumes that a minority RN government would struggle to govern effectively due to lack of presidential support and a united opposition.
- The author expresses skepticism towards the potential success of a centrist coalition including the Renaissance because of ideological differences and historical animosities.
- The author predicts a period of political chaos or gridlock could result due to the fragility of the potential coalitions, possibly culminating in yet another parliamentary election.
