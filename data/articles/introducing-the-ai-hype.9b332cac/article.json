    "There\u2019s no denying that the AI industry moves fast. Each week brings a bold new announcement, product release, or lofty claim that pushes the bounds of what we previously thought was possible. Separating AI fact from hyped-up fiction isn\u2019t always easy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created the AI Hype Index\u2014a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry. Our first index is a white-knuckle ride that ranges from the outright depressing\u2014rising numbers of sexually explicit deepfakes; the complete lack of rules governing Elon Musk\u2019s Grok AI model\u2014to the bizarre, including AI-powered dating wingmen and startup Friend\u2019s dorky intelligent-jewelry line.\u00a0  But it\u2019s not all a horror show\u2014at least not entirely. AI is being used for more wholesome endeavors, too, like simulating the classic video game Doom without a traditional gaming engine. Elsewhere, AI models have gotten so good at table tennis they can now beat beginner-level human opponents. They\u2019re also giving us essential insight into the secret names monkeys use to communicate with one another. Because while AI may be a lot of things, it\u2019s never boring.\u00a0 hide"
