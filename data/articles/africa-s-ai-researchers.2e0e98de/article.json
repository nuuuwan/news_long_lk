    "This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. When we talk about the global race for AI dominance, the conversation often focuses on tensions between the US and China, and European efforts at regulating the technology.\u00a0  But it\u2019s high time we talk about another player: Africa. As\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u00a0has written before, AI is creating a\u00a0new colonial world order, where the technology is enriching a small minority of people at the expense of the rest of the world.",
    "African AI researchers are determined to change that. They\u2019re forging their own path, developing tools that answer the needs of Africans, in their own languages. However, they face many barriers. AI research is eye-wateringly expensive, and African startups and researchers get a fraction of the funding their Western or Asian counterparts get. They have to innovate and rely on open source to do more with less.",
    "Despite that, the African AI story is not only a story of persistence and innovation, but of preserving cultures and fighting to shape how AI technologies are used on their own continent.\u00a0Read more here\u00a0from Abdullahi Tsanni, who went to this year\u2019s Deep Learning Indaba, a machine learning conference held annually in Senegal, to learn about the opportunities and barriers the African AI scene faces.\u00a0 And then some personal news!\u00a0This edition will be my last newsletter, and from next week you\u2019ll be in the extremely capable hands of my colleague\u00a0James O\u2019Donnell. It\u2019s been a delight writing this newsletter for the past two or so years, and I\u2019m so grateful you\u2019ve joined me on this journey covering everything from\u00a0snowballs of bullshit\u00a0to\u00a0Taylor Swift\u2019s deepfakes. I\u2019m not going anywhere though. I\u2019ll be diving deeper into the AI beat to bring you stories on what\u2019s happening in AI and how the technology is changing us and our societies. Stay tuned for more!\u00a0 Finally, while I have you, this week we\u2019re running our biggest sale of the year, with 50% off on an annual subscription of MIT Technology Review. New subscribers receive a free digital report on Generative AI and the future of work.\u00a0Subscribe here.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Algorithm Deeper Learning Why AI could eat quantum computing\u2019s lunch Tech companies have been funneling billions of dollars into quantum computers for years. The hope is that they\u2019ll be a game changer for fields as diverse as finance, drug discovery, and logistics. Those expectations have been especially high in physics and chemistry, where the weird effects of quantum mechanics come into play. In theory, this is where quantum computers could have a huge advantage over conventional machines. Enter AI:\u00a0But while the field struggles with the realities of tricky quantum hardware, another challenger is making headway in some of these most promising use cases. AI is now being applied to fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials science in a way that suggests quantum computing\u2019s purported home turf might not be so safe after all.\u00a0 Given the pace of recent advances, a growing number of researchers are now asking whether AI could solve a substantial chunk of the most interesting problems in chemistry and materials science before large-scale quantum computers become a reality.\u00a0Read more from Edd Gent here.\u00a0 Bits and Bytes The Saudis are planning a $100 billion AI powerhouse\u00a0Speaking of the race for AI dominance, this piece looks at how Saudi Arabia wants in on AI action. And it\u2019s putting its money where its mouth is. The country is investing a massive sum to develop a tech hub that it hopes will rival the neighboring United Arab Emirates. (Bloomberg)",
    "AI is making it harder to believe what is real and what is notTwo recent examples show just how influential AI slop can be in warping our sense of reality. In Dublin,\u00a0crowds gathered\u00a0in the city center to wait for a Halloween parade to take place. There was no parade planned, but the listing was created by AI and then picked up by social media users and local media. By way of contrast, some social media users dismissed\u00a0shocking images of the devastating recent floods in Spain\u00a0as AI-generated, despite them being entirely real.\u00a0 AI companies are getting comfortable offering their technology to the militaryMilitaries around the world have been pouring money into new technologies, including AI. Meta and Anthropic are the latest tech companies to start courting them, joining the likes of Google and OpenAI. (The Washington Post)\u00a0 OpenAI is shifting its strategy as the improvement in its AI tools slows downThe current paradigm in AI development is to make things bigger to make them better. But OpenAI\u2019s new model, code-named Orion, only performs slightly better than its predecessors. Instead, OpenAI is shifting to improving models after their initial training.
