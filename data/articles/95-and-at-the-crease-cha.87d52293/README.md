Chandra Schaffter received the ICCSL-Daily FT Most Admired Leader in Sri Lanka Award in 2019

Chandra Schaffter on 3 April 2025, celebrated a remarkable milestone—95 years of a life well lived. A man of many accomplishments, he has made a lasting impact on Sri Lanka’s sporting, business, and corporate landscapes. A true gentleman, he embodies resilience, dedication, and determination in every endeavour he has pursued.

Chandra Schaffter now holds the unique distinction of being the oldest living Ceylon cricketer, a testament to his enduring connection with the sport. His passion for cricket extended beyond playing—he was an administrator, mentor, and advocate for the game’s growth in Sri Lanka.

During his playing days in the pre-Test era of Ceylon cricket, he represented the country with skill and commitment at a time when international opportunities for Ceylonese cricketers were scarce. Schaffter played a pivotal role in upholding the nation’s cricketing reputation. Even after stepping away from competitive play, his administrative contributions and mentorship continued to shape the game, inspiring future generations.

Beyond the cricket field, Chandra Schaffter made his mark in business, particularly in Sri Lanka’s insurance, agriculture and dairy industries. As the founder of Janashakthi Insurance, he revolutionised the sector, bringing innovation, professionalism, and accessibility to financial services. Under his leadership, Janashakthi grew into one of Sri Lanka’s most recognised brands, offering protection and stability to thousands of families and businesses.

His journey as an entrepreneur was defined by vision, perseverance, and a deep sense of service. Even in a highly competitive industry, his people-centric approach ensured that insurance was not merely a business but a service that empowered and protected lives. His contributions laid the foundation for a modern, progressive insurance industry in Sri Lanka, setting new benchmarks for insurance products and innovation.

At 95, Chandra Schaffter remains an inspiration—a testament to dedication, adaptability, and lifelong learning. His ability to balance sportsmanship, business acumen, and social responsibility, along with his keen interest in national affairs, makes him a role model for younger generations.

Spanning over nine decades, his journey reflects the evolution of Sri Lanka itself—from the days of Ceylon to the present. He has navigated challenges with grace and fortitude and emerged stronger each time. Few individuals have had the privilege of witnessing and influencing multiple eras of national development, and Schaffter remains one of those rare figures who have done so with humility and grit.

As he steps into his 95th year, we celebrate not just his longevity but the profound legacy he has built in business, sports, and social responsibility. His contributions to Sri Lanka’s cricket, business, agriculture, philanthropy, and the well-being of upcountry estate workers and underprivileged communities have left an enduring impact. It is now up to the next generation, including his children and grandchildren, to carry his vision forward and continue the work he started through his creations and enterprises. Happy 95th Birthday to a sincere friend, gentleman and visionary—Chandra Schaffter.
