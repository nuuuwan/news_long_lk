    "Around 1,400 infants are being infected by HIV every day as a result of the new US administration\u2019s cuts to funding to AIDS organizations, new modeling suggests. In an executive order issued January 20, President Donald Trump paused new foreign aid funding to global health programs, and four days later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a stop-work order on existing foreign aid assistance. Surveys suggest that these changes forced more than a third of global organizations that provide essential HIV services to close within days of the announcements.\u00a0  Hundreds of thousands of people are losing access to HIV treatments as a result. Women and girls are missing out on cervical cancer screening and services for gender-based violence, too. A waiver Rubio later issued in an attempt to restore lifesaving services has had very little impact.\u00a0 \u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Jennifer Sherwood, director of research, public policy, at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, at a data-sharing event on March 17 at Columbia University in New York. \u201cEven funds that had already been appropriated, that were in the field, in people\u2019s bank accounts, [were] frozen.\u201d",

    "Rubio approved a waiver for \u201clife-saving\u201d humanitarian assistance on January 28. \u201cThis resumption is temporary in nature, and with limited exceptions as needed to continue life-saving humanitarian assistance programs, no new contracts shall be entered into,\u201d he said in a statement at the time. The US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which invests millions of dollars in the global AIDS response every year, was also granted a waiver February 1 to continue \u201clife-saving\u201d work.",
    "Despite this waiver, there have been devastating reports of the impact on health programs across the many low-income countries that relied on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which oversees PEPFAR, for funding. To get a better sense of the overall impact, amfAR conducted two surveys looking at more than 150 organizations that rely on PEPFAR funding in more than 26 countries.\u00a0 \u201cWe found really severe disruptions to HIV services,\u201d said Sherwood, who presented the findings at Columbia. \u201cAbout 90% of our participants said [the cuts] had severely limited their ability to deliver HIV services.\u201d Specifically, 94% of follow-up services designed to monitor people\u2019s progress were either canceled or disrupted. There were similarly dramatic disruptions to services for HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, and 92% of services for gender-based violence were canceled or disrupted. The cuts have plunged organizations into a \u201cdeep financial crisis,\u201d said Sherwood. Almost two-thirds of respondents said community-based staff were laid off before the end of January. When the team asked these organizations how long they could stay open without US funding, 36% said they had already closed. \u201cOnly 14% said that they were able to stay open longer than a month,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cAnd \u2026 this data was collected longer than a month ago.\u201d The organizations said tens of thousands of the people they serve would lose HIV treatment within a month. For some organizations, that figure was over 100,000, said Sherwood.\u00a0  Part of the problem is that the stop-work order came at a time when these organizations were already experiencing \u201cshortages in commodities,\u201d Sherwood said. Typically, centers might give a person a six-month supply of antiretroviral drugs. Before the stop-work order, many organizations were only giving one-month supplies. \u201cAlmost all of their clients are due to come back and pick up [more] treatments in this 90-day freeze,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can really see the panic this has caused.\u201d The waiver for \u201clife-saving\u201d treatment didn\u2019t do much to remedy this situation. Only 5% of the organizations received funds under the waiver, while the vast majority either were told they didn\u2019t qualify or had not been told they could restart services. \u201cWhile the waiver might be one important avenue to restart some services, it cannot, on the whole, save the US HIV program,\u201d says Sherwood. \u201cIt is very limited in scope, and it has not been widely communicated to the field.\u201d AmfAR isn\u2019t the only organization tracking the impact of US funding cuts. At the same event, Sara Casey, assistant professor of population and family health at Columbia, presented results of a survey of 101 people who work in organizations reliant on US aid. They reported seeing disruptions to services in humanitarian responses, gender-based violence, mental health, infectious diseases, essential medicines and vaccines, and more. \u201cMany of these should have been eligible for the \u2018life-saving\u2019 waivers,\u201d Casey said. Casey and her colleagues have also been interviewing people in Colombia, Kenya, and Nepal. In those countries, women of reproductive age, newborns and children, people living with HIV, members of the LGBTQI+ community, and migrants are among those most affected by the cuts, she said, and health workers, who are primarily women, are losing their livelihoods.",

    "\u201cThere will be really disproportionate impacts on the world\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d said Sherwood. Women make up 67% of the health-care workforce, according to the World Health Organization. They also make up 63% of PEPFAR clients. PEPFAR has supported gender equality and services for gender-based violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if other countries or other donors \u2026 can or will pick up these types of programs, especially in the face of competing priorities about keeping people on treatment and keeping people alive,\u201d said Sherwood. Sherwood and her colleagues at amfAR have also done some modeling work to determine the potential impact of cuts to PEPFAR on women and girls, using data from last year to create their estimates. \u201cEach day that the stop-work order is in place, we estimate that there are 1,400 new HIV infections among infants,\u201d she said. And every day, over 7,000 women stand to miss out on cervical cancer screenings. The funding cuts have also had a dramatic effect on mental-health services, said Farah Arabe, who serves on the advisory board of the Global Mental Health Action Network. Arabe presented the preliminary findings of an ongoing survey of mental-health organizations from 29 countries that receive US aid. \u201cUnfortunately, this is a very grim picture,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly 5% of individuals who were receiving services in 2024 will be able to receive services in 2025.\u201d\u00a0 The same goes for children and adolescents. \u201cThis is a particularly sad picture because children \u2026 are going through brain development,\u201d she said. \u201cImpacts \u2026 at this early stage of life have lifelong impacts on academic achievement, economic productivity, mental health, physical health \u2026 even the ability to parent the next generation.\u201d\u00a0 For now, nonprofits and aid and research organizations are scrambling to try to understand, and potentially limit, the impact of the cuts. Some are hoping to locate new sources of funding, independent of the US.\u00a0 \u201cI am deeply concerned that progress in disease eradication, poverty reduction, and gender equality is at risk of being reversed,\u201d said Thoai Ngo of Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, who chaired the event. \u201cWithout urgent action, preventable deaths will rise, more people will fall into poverty, and as always, women and girls will bear the heaviest burden.\u201d On March 10, Rubio announced the results of his department\u2019s review of USAID. \u201cAfter a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID,\u201d he shared via the social media platform X.\u00a0 hide"
