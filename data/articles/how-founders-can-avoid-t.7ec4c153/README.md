Entrepreneurs walk a razor-thin line between telling compelling stories and peddling lies — a misstep can easily lead to slipping into what the authors call the “deception trap.” It starts when entrepreneurs, through their storytelling and framing, establish their identities, promote their visions, and set expectations for themselves and their stakeholders. Yet, framing the future can easily turn into a vicious cycle of expanding deceit if expectations cannot be met and entrepreneurs attempt to deliver at all costs. Entrepreneurs should take a few steps to protect themselves: 1) set realistic stretch goals and keep stakeholders informed of the risks, 2) understand the “fail” in “fail fast” as rapid experimentation to identify promising alternatives, not a license to take poorly conceived risks, and 3) be realistic when creating early prototypes and reporting on milestones.

There is an increasingly familiar story in the tech world: After a meteoric rise, a dazzling young wunderkind is disgraced when it’s revealed that their world-changing innovation is held together by promises and deceit. Recently, it was Sam Bankman-Fried, found guilty of seven counts of fraud. But a downfall like Bankman-Fried’s is all too familiar, as is the hubris, ambition, greed, and persuasive (but ultimately deceptive) storytelling that preceded it. What is, perhaps, most notable about this story is how unremarkable it is.
