    "Sublime Systems has invented a new, lower-energy process to create cement.\u00a0  Conventional cement kilns burn fossil fuels to reach F 1500 \u00b0C (hotter than lava), the scorching temperature needed to turn raw ingredients into cement. Generating this amount of heat contributes to the material\u2019s massive carbon footprint. The chemical reactions required to make cement also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so much so that the substance has the dubious distinction of being the largest emitter of carbon dioxide among industrial materials.\u00a0 Sublime Systems is changing this with a novel approach to creating cement that reduces both the energy consumption and the amount of carbon dioxide released. Rather than kilns, the company uses an electrochemical process to charge a bath of chemicals and rocks to form its cement product. By using renewable energy sources to power the process, they can reduce emissions dramatically.\u00a0   Key indicators  Industry:\u00a0Cement\u00a0 Founded:\u00a02020 Headquarters:\u00a0Somerville, Massachusetts, USA Notable fact:\u00a0Sublime\u2019s first commercial pour was a result of the developer\u2019s vice president, Yanni Tsipis, reading our profile of the company on last year\u2019s list.\u00a0   Potential for impact The abundance of cement is hard to wrap your head around. By some estimates, there are 9,000 pounds of it for every person in the world. Some 4 billion metric tons are produced annually. The global cement industry has committed to achieving net zero by 2050, and Sublime\u2019s technology could play an important role in getting it there: The company claims its process can cut emissions associated with cement production by 90%, assuming it can scale.",
    "Caveats While Sublime\u2019s technology is promising, the big question is whether it can scale quickly enough to meet the industry\u2019s ambitious net-zero goals by 2050.\u00a0 There are roughly 3,000 cement plants in the world, each producing an average of 1 million metric tons per year. In contrast, Sublime\u2019s first commercial facility, which will go online by 2026, will produce only 30,000 tons of cement\u2014a relative drop in the bucket.",

    "Besides the question of Sublime\u2019s ability to produce enough cement to scale, there are also the challenges of competing in a low-margin industry that\u2019s slow to change. To wit, one common alternative that marginally cuts emissions, called Portland limestone cement, was approved under an industry standard in 2012 but took another eight years to grow from 2 percent to 3 percent of total US cement production. (Today, the material accounts for roughly 35 percent of the US market.) And because most cement is produced locally, to make a dent in the problem, Sublime\u2019s electrochemical process, or one like it, would have to replace cement kilns in thousands of facilities around the world.\u00a0 Next steps While other companies are working on new cement-making methods, Sublime is leading the pack, with a pilot facility in Somerville that\u2019s producing 250 tons per year. In May, the company had its first commercial pour, with 2.5 tons of Sublime\u2019s cement used in the lobby and sidewalk of One Boston Wharf, Boston\u2019s largest net-zero commercial building. In March, Sublime announced it received\u00a0a $87 million grant from the Department of Energy to build out its first commercial facility, in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The grant will cover roughly 50% of construction costs. And in September, two leading cement producers\u2014Holcim AG\u00a0and\u00a0CRH PLC\u2014invested $75 million into the company. 202415 Climate Tech Companies to WatchSee the full listBYDCeiboElectric HydrogenFirst SolarForm EnergyGogoroKairos PowerLanzaJetPano AiPivot BioRondo EnergyRumin8SolugenSublime SystemsSun KingSublime is moving forward on permitting and planning for the new plant as well as drumming up pre-sales.
