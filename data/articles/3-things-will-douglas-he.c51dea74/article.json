    "The most amazing drummer on the internet My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano\u2019s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.\u00a0  EL ESTEPARIO SIBERIANO VIA YOUTUBE   Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there\u2019s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It\u2019s why my favorites are Garrido\u2019s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot\u2019s \u201cRa Ta Ta\u201d and tell me it doesn\u2019t put happiness in your heart. Finding signs of life in the uncanny valley Watching Sora \u00advideos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.\u00a0  Still from ED ATKINS PIANOWORK 2 2023COURTESY: THE ARTIST, CABINET GALLERY, LONDON, D\u00c9PENDANCE, BRUSSELS, GLADSTONE GALLERY   In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. \u201cWhen an actor breaks character during a scene, it\u2019s known as corpsing,\u201d Atkins has said. \u201cI want everything I make to corpse.\u201d Next to Atkins\u2019s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive. A dark and dirty book about a talking dingo What\u2019s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay\u2019s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you\u2019d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don\u2019t even make any sense.\u00a0  SCRIBE   With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay\u2019s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we\u2019ve all fallen into. It\u2019s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain\u2014and a meditation on the hard limits of communication. hide"
