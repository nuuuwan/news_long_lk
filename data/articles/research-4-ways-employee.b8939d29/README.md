A critical factor influencing the effectiveness of DEI initiatives is how employees respond to them. Traditionally, employee responses have been overly simplified as “resistors,” who complicate or hinder DEI initiatives, or “supporters” of DEI, who facilitate their implementation. Recent research suggests employee reactions can be broken down into four categories: excited supporters, calm compliers, torn shapers, and discontented opponents. Understanding these various responses can help managers customize their approaches rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all policy.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, like diversity training, targeted recruiting, or dedicated diversity-focused leadership roles, strive to address inequities, cultivate an environment where everyone feels valued, and increase the representation of historically marginalized groups. Indeed, many organizations are investing substantial effort and money in DEI efforts globally. These are generally rolled out using a one-size-fits-all approach for all employees.
