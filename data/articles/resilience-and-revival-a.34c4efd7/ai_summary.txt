The following article reflects on the ways in which Vesak, a festival of light, has symbolised unity in diversity for Sri Lankan people. The author, Ajanta Dharmasiri, discusses the importance of inner calm, or stillness, as essential to productive and harmonious life, referencing Buddha, Eckhart Tolle and Mahatma Ghandi. He also talks about the role diversity plays in co-operation and harmony, both in nature and in human society, citing the theories of Stephen Covey and the natural concept of symbiosis.

Dharmasiri relates these observations to current and recent crises in Sri Lanka, such as the 2004 tsunami, the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, critiquing the country's leaders for failing to act on promises of unity, while praising ordinary people for their mutual support. He concludes by urging all Sri Lankans to practise serenity, synergy and solidarity (or "SriLankanness"), and work toward the sociocultural, economic and spiritual betterment of the nation.
