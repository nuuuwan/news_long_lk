"Mighty-middle" startups are businesses that aim for valuations between the high single-digit to high tens of millions within 5-10 years, targeting midsize niches with substantial growth potential. These startups are often bootstrapped and require entrepreneurs to have diverse skills. They offer a favourable risk-reward tradeoff for both founders and investors, with the former being able to retain control and start paying themselves sooner. To support these startups, tailored support that focuses on mentorship and showcasing successful examples is necessary.
