    "In EIU\u2019s\u00a0Democracy Index for 2024, Asia and Australasia continue to lag behind the rest of the world. More than half of the 28\u00a0geographies included in our index recorded score declines, marking a sixth\u00a0consecutive year of regression (or stasis). The region\u2019s index score declined in 2024 compared to\u00a02023, from 5.41 to\u00a05.31 (on a 0-10\u00a0scale). The downgrade reflects a series of political developments over the past year, which represent\u00a0the region\u2019s continued, gradual drift away from representative\u00a0democracy.",
    "South Korea\u00a0was one of the countries that drove the region\u2019s democratic backsliding in 2024. The\u00a0ongoing political crisis, which stemmed from the (short-lived) declaration of martial law by the then-president, Yoon\u00a0Suk-yeol, in December, prompted us to demote that country into the \u201cflawed\u00a0democracy\u201d classification. Although public protests against Yoon\u00a0Suk-yeol\u2019s moves reflected the resilience of local democratic institutions in the face of sudden challenges, the incident has exposed institutional issues regarding presidential power\u2014and increased the risk of future political violence and social unrest. Deep-rooted political acrimony between South\u00a0Korea\u2019s political parties will keep a resolution elusive in the near term, despite our expectations that the opposition leader, Lee\u00a0Jae-myung, will ultimately contest (and win) the country\u2019s next elections, which will eventually restore stability to the political\u00a0landscape.",
    "South-east Asian nations\u00a0saw troubling political dynamics emerge in 2024, amid a region-wide backsliding into dynastic politics in countries like\u00a0Indonesia, Thailand\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Philippines.\u00a0The near-term outlook for regional democracy is challenging.\u00a0Indonesia\u00a0faces renewed student activism, reflecting dissatisfaction with recent\u00a0budget cuts, the establishment of a controversial\u00a0second sovereign wealth fund, and the amendment of laws to expand the role of the military in civilian governance (which has resulted in\u00a0equity market turmoil). In\u00a0Thailand, the prime minister, Paetongtarn\u00a0Shinawatra,\u00a0faces an increasingly hostile opposition, amid allegations that she operates under the undue influence of her father, Thaksin (himself a former Thai prime minister). And in the\u00a0Philippines, the\u00a0arrest of Rodrigo\u00a0Duterte, the former president, will deepen the political battle between the Duterte\u00a0family\u2014his daughter,\u00a0Sara, is serving as the country\u2019s vice-president, but was impeached in early\u00a0February\u2014and the prime minister, Ferdinand\u00a0\u201cBongbong\u201d\u00a0Marcos\u00a0Jr, who hails from the Marcos political dynasty (which dominated the Philippines in\u00a01965-86).",
    "South Asia\u00a0saw a dramatic year, with many of the elections that did occur marred by fraud and violence. Political demonstrations in\u00a0Bangladesh,\u00a0following elections in January\u00a02024 (which were seen as neither free nor fair),\u00a0toppled the previous government under Sheikh\u00a0Hasina\u00a0Wajed in August\u00a02024, ushering in a new era of change. Even so, the country\u2019s\u00a0future economic and political outlook\u00a0remains uncertain under the current interim government; EIU sees it as highly likely (30-40% probability) that authorities could delay future elections until 2026, representing a degradation in the country\u2019s democratic norms. Elections in\u00a0Pakistan, held in February last year, faced allegations of political repression and interference\u2014factors which will persist for as long as the country\u2019s security situation\u00a0remains unstable. Although\u00a0Sri\u00a0Lanka\u00a0saw a change of government\u00a0in its November elections, the political landscape remains unpredictable, with further democratisation dependent on the ability of civil society to push for reforms (and the willingness of political institutions to embrace them). By contrast, elections in\u00a0India\u00a0were judged to be more free and fair; the polls\u00a0returned a shockingly low\u00a0majority for the incumbent Bharatiya\u00a0Janata\u00a0Party, despite their tight control on the media. Public concerns around employment and the erosion of social freedoms were reflected in the ballot, attesting to the perseverance of democratic processes in the\u00a0country.",
    "Australia, Japan, New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0remain the region\u2019s only \u201cfull\u00a0democracies.\u201d Even so, several of these geographies face important challenges to their democratic institutions this year:\u00a0Australians\u00a0will head to the polls in May\u00a02025, with the\u00a0most likely electoral outcome\u00a0being a hung parliament, raising questions around whether (or how) the next government will seek to bypass legislative impediments to its agenda. In\u00a0Taiwan, the executive-legislature split has already frustrated policymaking,\u00a0where opposition parties have sought to weaponise the legislature against the president, including by\u00a0knee-capping the Taiwanese constitutional court.\u00a0Japan\u2018s\u00a0prime minister, Ishiba\u00a0Shigeru, has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, amid a series of\u00a0scandals tied to himself and his party, which will preserve pressure on him to resign before the upper-house elections in\u00a0July.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
