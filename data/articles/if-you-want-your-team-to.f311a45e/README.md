Many companies have been quick to provide new gen AI tools to their staff, but with varying take up among employees. Researchers at Deloitte hypothesized that a driving reason workers weren’t using these tools — and companies weren’t seeing strong ROI — was because employees lacked trust in the technology. The researchers decided to pilot a new program aimed at addressing what they call “the four factors of trust”: reliability, capability, transparency, and humanity. After launching the initiative with a test group of 750 Deloitte consultants, the researchers saw a 49% rise in perceptions of the tool’s reliability, a 52% increase in beliefs about its transparency, a 14% increase in new users and a 65% increase in the average number of visits per user.

Between splashy headlines heralding trillions of dollars in potential value and billions of dollars spent by organizations to realize that value, you might assume that gen AI tools have become a vital part of the workplace. The data tells a different story.
