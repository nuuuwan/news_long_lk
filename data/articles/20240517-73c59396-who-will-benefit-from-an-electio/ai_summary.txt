The upcoming Sri Lankan Presidential election is expected to be one of the most unpredictable in history due to the significant shift in voter sentiment caused by the economic crisis and widespread protests in 2022. Traditional political attachments have been disrupted, impacting the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party, which has seen a dramatic decline in voter support.

Economic hardships and the protest movement, known as the Aragalaya, have reshaped the political landscape in the South. In contrast, Northern Tamils have largely remained detached from these Southern movements, recalling past economic hardships during the war and feeling excluded from the current political discourse.

Against this backdrop, Tamil political factions are divided on how to approach the election: some advocate for boycotting the election to reject Sinhalese candidates, while others propose fielding a common Tamil candidate. The main Tamil political party, the Ilangai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), remains noncommittal, with internal disagreement on the strategy.

A decision to boycott could lower the votes needed for a candidate to achieve the constitutional 50% requirement, while a common Tamil candidate could compel Southern candidates to address Tamil issues. Regardless, the Tamil stance is expected to significantly affect the election dynamics, potentially leading to deserted polling booths in the North or influencing the distribution of votes among Sinhalese candidates.
