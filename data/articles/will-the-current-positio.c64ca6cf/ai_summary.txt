Facts:

- The 13th Amendment (13A) to the Sri Lankan Constitution, introduced in 1987, has been controversial for over three-and-a-half decades.
- The 13A sought to introduce the system of Provincial Councils but has not been fully implemented by any government so far.
- Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the two main candidates in the upcoming Presidential Election, pledged last week that their future governments would implement the 13A.
- Previous attempts at implementing the 13A, such as those suggested by President Ranil Wickremesinghe last year, encountered significant opposition, leading to protests.
- In response to the 13A controversy, Wickremesinghe suggested that a new constitutional amendment could be introduced to repeal the 13A, but no one has yet come forward to do so.
- Current MP and former Chief Minister of the Northern Province, Justice C.V. Wigneswaran, has been assured by Premadasa that his future government would fully implement the 13A.
-Wickremesinghe expressed doubt that any government could implement the 13A with both Police and land powers. 
- In the wake of Premadasa and Dissanayake's declarations of support for the 13A, nationalist and Buddhist organizations are expected to oppose them in run-up to the Presidential Election.

Opinions:

- Based on comments made by Dissanayake to ITAK leaders, the author concludes that the NPP currently supports the full implementation of the 13A.
- The author questions how Premadasa and Dissanayake will handle potential opposition from Sinhalese nationalists over their declarations in Jaffna.
- While recounting an interaction between Wickremesinghe and Wigneswaran, the author suggests that Wickremesinghe does not believe it is possible for any government to implement the 13A with Police and land powers.
- Reflecting on the opposition to Premadasa and Dissanayake's declarations of support for the 13A, it's inferred that the Tamil people have doubts about whether either candidate will maintain their position amid such opposition.
- The author expresses skepticism over whether Premadasa and Dissanayake will follow through with what they've pledged in their election manifestos, pointing towards bitter experiences of the Tamil people with promises made by southern Sinhalese leaders in the past.
- The author suggests it would be a great thing if Premadasa and Dissanayake's current positions influence a positive change in misconceptions among Sinhalese society about the devolution of power.
