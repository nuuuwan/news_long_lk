If you often feel overwhelmed by your workload, and feel you’ve got more on your plate than you can manage, it could be because you’re overcommitting. A few reasons why we overcommit include our desire for validation, fear of rejection or failure, and constantly...more

“Can you take on this project?” Yes. “Can you lead this new initiative?” Absolutely. “Can you organize the team lunch?”  Of course.

This was me a few years ago, when I transitioned from my career as a therapist to clinical operations at a digital health start-up. Eager to prove my worth, I felt I had no other choice but to say yes to every request that came my way.

How was I going to fit all of this into my schedule? I had no idea.

Everyone on the team had more experience than me in working in digital health. They had been embedded in the startup industry for longer, and they knew so many things I didn’t know.

So, I believed that taking on more responsibility than I could handle would show others that I was competent, reliable, dedicated, and most importantly, valuable. What I didn’t realize at that time was that overcommitting came with two major costs: the quality of my work and my health.

This realization came to me after I had hastily completed a report (because there was so much to get done), and my manager said, “This could have been a much better report if you’d spent a little more time on it.”

The irony was hard to ignore. Doing more was making me less productive. It was also leaving me overworked, overwhelmed, and exhausted.

Here’s Probably Why You’re Overcommitted

Early career professionals often fall into this fallacy: believing that overcommitment — taking on more tasks or responsibilities than they can realistically manage — will make them appear more competent and indispensable. They may feel immense pressure to prove why they were hired or to compare their achievements to more experienced colleagues. Compounded by societal narratives of equating busyness with success, and workplace cultures that reward overachieving, early career professionals can find themselves locked in a cycle of saying “yes” to everything — at the expense of their health, creativity, and long-term productivity.

One factor driving overcommitment is our emotions that are working behind the scenes to influence our decisions and behaviors. For early career professionals (and anyone else, for that matter!), identifying and understanding their emotions can help break the cycle of taking on too much.

Based on my insights and research for my book Toxic Productivity: Reclaim your time and emotional energy in a world that always demands more, there are three emotional dynamics that can lead you to overcommitting in the workplace that impact how you feel or behave.

Desire for validation (especially from managers): You might be taking on more than you can manage as you may have a strong need to be recognized and valued and depend on external validation to see the value of your work. But this dependence on other people’s opinion may prevent you from developing important skills. For instance, instead of seeing feedback as an opportunity for growth, you might interpret it as a criticism of your value as an employee and feel anxious instead of learning from it. Or you might not attempt new projects or tasks at work, preferring to stay in your comfort zone, instead of risking mistakes or failure.

Fear of rejection and failure: You might fear potentially disappointing colleagues or being perceived as incapable. This fear can push you to accept tasks beyond your capacity or capability, believing that saying “no” will harm your reputation or career trajectory.

Comparison with others: Seeing peers handle heavy workloads can create unfair comparisons and an internal pressure to keep up, even if their circumstances differ. For instance, a coworker who manages a demanding workload effortlessly might have different resources, experience, support systems, or personal circumstances that make that possible. When you compare yourself to them, you discount these factors and judge yourself unfairly. It’s essential to recognize that everyone’s situation is unique — what works for someone else might not work for you, and that’s okay. Focusing on your strengths and limitations, and acknowledging your unique context helps you have clarity about what is reasonable and possible for you.

Research shows that overcommitment increases stress levels, which can lead to emotional distress, such as feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and exacerbates physical health concerns such as sleep issues. Overcommitment can also lead to “siege” mentality — where you feel like you are always under pressure or attack, leading to increased disagreements with others and dissatisfaction at work.

Breaking out of this emotional cycle requires a shift in mindset: understanding that sustainable success comes not from doing everything but from doing the right things well.

Signs You’re Overcommitted

You can’t change something you are unaware of. So, to make a meaningful change, you need to know how overcommitment shows up in your habits, and that begins with self-awareness.

Here are some signs you might be overcommitted.

Saying yes to requests without considering your capacity: Your manager requests a volunteer for a high-profile client event. You already have a packed week with three other projects, but you immediately raise your hand to offer your time. Later, you realize that you have no idea how to fit this into your workload and you may be working the next three weekends to meet the deadlines.

Avoiding prioritization and tackling whatever seems most urgent: You log into your email in the morning and realize you haven’t really cleared your inbox in the last week. You start responding to them in the order they came in and end up spending the first half of the morning doing just that, In the afternoon you realize you also have a client presentation to submit in a couple of hours. You rush through it, only to end up getting a lot of feedback and making all the changes your colleagues point out.

Frequently working late hours or during weekends to “catch up”: On a Sunday morning, you log into your work email to “just get ahead and prepare a little before the week starts.” Before you know it, you’ve spent her entire day at your laptop. By Sunday night, you’re exhausted and anxious about another busy week ahead.

Experiencing anxiety or resentment when asked for help or feedback: During a team meeting, a colleague asks for your support on a new project. Outwardly, you smile and agree, but inside, you feel a wave of resentment and think to yourself, “Why did I say yes?”

Feeling worried or guilty when you have free time: After finishing a big task early, you take a much-deserved coffee break. As you sit down you start to feel guilty, and instead of relaxing, you open your laptop and start reviewing next week’s tasks.

Constantly second-guessing your decisions: You agreed to mentor a new hire. A few days in, you start to fall behind on deadlines. Then, you start to wonder, “Did I make a mistake by taking this mentee on?” At the same time, the thought of stepping back makes you worry: “If I ask to step out, will my manager think I’m not reliable and not call me out for new projects?” The indecision stresses you out and you do nothing about it.

Embrace Micro-shifts to Help You Find Balance

We all approach our work a certain way. And if it’s not working for us, it’s time to make small micro-shifts to help us break out of the overcommitting mindset.

Regularly assess your workload.

Create an intentional habit of looking ahead. Once a week, look at all your current responsibilities and time commitments for the week (or even a couple months) ahead. Then, reflect on which upcoming opportunities realistically fit in your schedule and are related to your scope of work. Remember, your calendar doesn’t have to be jam-packed for you to know you’re at full capacity. It should have some white spaces for things that may come up at the last minute or for doing some deep work when you need it. This will help you have an accurate idea of what you are already committed to and how much time you really have.

Practice regular emotional check-ins with yourself.

It can help to do an emotional check-in with yourself regularly. Self-reflection will keep you connected to your emotions and give you insight into the direction of your career. During your weekly workload reflections (mentioned above), ask yourself:

How am I feeling about my current responsibilities? This will show you if you are aligned with your workload or feeling overwhelmed (and can be a red flag that you may have overcommitted).

How am I feeling about my coworkers and work in general? This will help uncover the emotional connection you have to your work. Feeling disconnected, unsupported, or indifferent can be a red flag for a lack of boundaries.

What am I excited about / feel dread about? This will help you highlight parts of your work that energize you so that you can leverage those aspects to increase a sense of joy and fulfillment at work. This helps improve resilience and self-confidence (thus, reducing the urge to overcommit). Knowing which tasks drain you can help you reassess your workload, or if you must do them, prepare better ahead of time to get them done.

Use pre-emptive communication.

Proactively schedule standing checkpoints of communication — a weekly email or meeting with your supervisor. In this time, you can let your manager know in advance about your capacity and discuss priorities and opportunities.

For example, you can say, “This week, I’m focused on completing [task] and [task]. If you need help with other projects, I can assist starting next week” or, “I am working on A, B and C over the next two weeks. If you’d like me to do it, perhaps you can help me figure out what is highest priority, and we can shift things around accordingly?”

Create a “decision delay buffer.”

Train yourself to never commit to a request immediately. Instead, use phrases like “Let me check my current schedule and get back to you?” or “I’d love to, but would it be okay to let you know by tomorrow?” to buy time. When you reflect on the request, remember to consider your current and upcoming priorities and deadlines. You might have time this week, but what about in two weeks? Buying time allows you to accurately review your capacity and workload. It gives you the time to be thoughtful about your response, honor your boundaries, and decline in a polite way.

Practice “micro-mastery.”

You might feel tempted to say yes to every opportunity that comes your way, believing that all experience is good experience. While that might be true sometimes, irrelevant experience should not come at the cost of relevant experience. Micro-mastery is focusing on excelling in one or two specific small areas of your role (tasks or opportunities), instead of saying yes to everything.

In order to assess which opportunity or task is relevant to your micro-mastery goals, ask yourself these questions before agreeing to anything:

Asses the relevance and impact on your long-term goals: Does this directly build the skills I want to develop?

Consider the cost: Will taking this on impact my ability to perform in other areas?

Does it provide something (visibility, skill building, growth): Will this allow me to showcase my skills to managers or does it allow me to refine/develop a skill?

If the opportunities or tasks aren’t related to what you want to master, use the above skill of “decision delay buffer” to decline. If the opportunities or tasks are related to what you want to master, use the above skills of “preemptive communication” to alert your manager about your interest and to help you re-prioritize if possible.

We often feel the pressure to say “yes” to every opportunity, believing that missing out on anything could set us back. When you are feeling overwhelmed, it is helpful to remind yourself that by letting an opportunity go and not overcommitting yourself, you’re not failing, you’re being thoughtful about your choices. This allows you to protect your valuable time and energy resources to reserve them for things that truly matter — your emotional wellbeing and professional growth.

The truth is: not every opportunity is meant for you, and sometimes missed chances can make space for the right chances.
