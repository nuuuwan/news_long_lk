Public-private partnerships (PPPs) and blended finance facilities can accelerate climate action efforts, especially in developing countries, according to an op-ed by a member of the SLYCAN Trust, a Sri Lankan sustainable solutions think tank. PPPs encourage collaboration between government entities and the private sector to implement projects combating climate change, while blended finance facilities combine concessional finance from public, multilateral, or philanthropic sources with funding from private investors. Both tools can foster green investments and climate action, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, transportation, tourism, and energy, while reducing risk exposure and increasing returns on investment. The author also notes that the frameworks can lead to policy or regulatory changes.
