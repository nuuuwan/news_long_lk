The article criticizes the conduct and demands of Members of Parliament (MPs) in the face of Sri Lanka's ongoing economic crisis, where poverty remains high and many people struggle to afford basic necessities. MPs are accused of being profligate and unethical, demanding permits to import new cars and securing profitable liquor permits through their connections. They are also seeking to extend their substantial insurance coverage to their families, despite the country's dire financial situation. The World Bank’s data highlights that both poor and non-poor people in Sri Lanka face steep increases in the cost of living, with significant job losses in the construction sector and overall poverty rates doubling recently. This behavior of MPs is compared to that of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution, showing their disconnect from the hardships faced by common people. The article warns politicians to be mindful of the rising public anger and dissatisfaction, suggesting that ignoring the populace’s plight could lead to political repercussions in upcoming elections.
