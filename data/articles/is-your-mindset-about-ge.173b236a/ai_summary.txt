Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can be transformative for young professionals, a tech entrepreneur said. While there are risks such as becoming overreliant or compromising private data, the benefits of heightened productivity and creative inspiration are substantial. However, to obtain the competitive advantage GenAI brings, professionals need to overcome five limiting mindsets: GenAI is overhyped; it canâ€™t be trusted; there is no personal need for it; it is seen as a threat; and its future is uncertain. To effectively navigate GenAI, one needs to use it sensibly and be willing to challenge restrictions. This is important as the technology offers a unique competitive advantage that can be leveraged to climb the professional ladder quickly.
