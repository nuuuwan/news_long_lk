Despite concerns over its usefulness and potential impact, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers many benefits, including heightened productivity and creative inspiration. However, to realise these benefits, users need to move past five limiting mindsets: thinking GenAI is overhyped and underperforming; believing GenAI cannot be trusted; believing you don't need GenAI; seeing GenAI as a threat; and viewing GenAI's future as uncertain. In overcoming these misconceptions, professionals can gain a competitive advantage, particularly when combined with developing complementary human skills, such as critical thinking and problem solving.
