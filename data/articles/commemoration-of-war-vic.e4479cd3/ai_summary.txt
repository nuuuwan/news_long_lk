The Sri Lankan government commemorates the military victories over the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) but prevents public mourning of Tamil victims. These contradicting actions illustrate the state's refusal to acknowledge its violent actions during these conflicts, according to an op-ed in the Morning. The author argues the state should not differentiate between the victims based on race, religion, caste, or creed, and urges a common memorial to heal divided communities. The piece also points out the importance of reconciliation, admitting past wrongdoings, and offering apologies, emphasized by the fact that the JVP recently apologized for its own crimes during the insurrections.
