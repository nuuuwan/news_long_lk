Serving on boards is a vital part of what venture capitalists do. VCs who succeed at this will enjoy advantages, including building their own brand, increasing deal flow, and helping the companies they invest in perform better. To navigate board rooms more...more

Being a successful venture capitalist isn’t just about making investments. It’s also about serving on boards of the companies you invest in. Yet the majority of venture education focuses on the first part of this process: deal sourcing, due diligence, selection, and winning the investment. Once the investment is made, that transition quickly catalyzes to serving on the board. However, many new investors are thrown into the deep end without first learning how to swim. Rarely is there a formal onboarding process to teach best practices and how to avoid common mistakes.

The boardroom can be a daunting place. Becoming effective in this setting is arguably one of the most complex parts of an investor’s job. It’s also the part of the role with significant upside: If you can master the boardroom, you can help drive company performance. You can also build your brand as an investor, help secure future deal flow, recruit talent, and win competitive deals. And on a personal level, becoming an effective director can create positive, meaningful interactions that bring value and purpose to your investing practice.

As an investor and active board member, I have lived through the apprenticeship model and learned to do this myself. In this article, I aim to equip newer investors with the tools and strategies to start building their board practice from the start.

Based on my own experience and observations of others, I suggest newer VCs follow these seven tips:

Assume a powerful position.

During my first board meetings, I would slink to the corner of the main table, trying to be inconspicuous. I felt like an imposter, and taking this position inhibited me from asking the questions on my mind — then, when another board member asked that exact question, they received the collective head-nod from others acknowledging its relevance. For me, the mental shift beyond this quiet and passive role happened at one meeting, when the seat at the head of the boardroom table was left open. Without hesitation I took the invitation and sat in it. It’s strange how assuming a more powerful position in the room affected my attitude and confidence. I spoke up more often in that meeting, made eye contact with other members, and noticed the head-nods to the questions I posed. Small moves and gestures can be meaningful to set yourself up for success and be engaged at the start of the meeting.

A common misconception is that the most important interaction is the board meeting itself. As a self-proclaimed introvert, I initially made the mistake of relying on small talk before and after board meetings to engage with the broader group. I would keep it light, focusing on scientific areas I was interested in or the weather.

This approach has its limitations. I learned that when I opened up at a board dinner about an outside endeavor: that although I was not a distance runner, I was training to run the Boston Marathon. I inadvertently mentioned running 16 miles in the blistering cold as part of my training plan. It created an opening for the collective discussion to shift from work to working out. Other directors who were avid runners began providing helpful marathon tips. Non-runners shared other workouts they enjoyed. One board member talked about the importance of physical activity to combat personal struggles with mental health he had endured post-Covid.

Beyond the formal votes and documentation directors must engage with, it’s important to realize that boards are human enterprises — and relationships are the currency for how business is done. Whether it’s grabbing drinks prior or going for a one-on-one walk, finding unique channels to build relationships outside of the boardroom is valuable. Similarly, learning about the personal lives of your management team (e.g., families, hobbies, charitable work) helps in understanding the real-life challenges they face and their sources of motivation.

Recognize that ownership is power.

A startup board is different than that of a publicly-traded company. Most directors will be other VCs who also hold stakes in the company. Knowing and anticipating the positions and priorities of the major shareholders will serve you well, particularly around decisive votes when navigating critical times (e.g., refinancings, changes in control, transactions). Don’t be fooled by who takes up the most air in the room. Some investors like to hear themselves talk and are used to the power of their opinions in deciding the fate of funding for the numerous companies that pitch to them. But power doesn’t come from being the loudest person in the room. The real power is decided by the ownership, as shown on the cap table. And if you aren’t one of the major shareholders, it’s important to anticipate their priorities and ensure alignment (or to have a strategically sound counter-position).

Avoid this key mindset mistake.

In the lead-up to making an investment, investors are heavily focused on identifying risks through due diligence. But once the investment is made, it is critical that the mindset switches quickly to managing risk by productive interactions with management and other board members. In other words, the focus must shift from due diligence to collaboration mode.

Some people struggle to make this shift, and that can have huge consequences. I’ve seen this play out at one board meeting, where an observer peppered the management team with a slew of diligence questions, monopolizing 20 minutes and taking everyone down an unnecessary rabbit hole. At the next board meeting, observers were asked to not attend in person, and I couldn’t blame the CEO for taking precautionary measures to avoid future disruption.

Be thoughtful in how you frame questions and be clear on the intentions behind them. For example, rather than asking a skeptical-sounding question about engagement with strategic buyers for business development, frame the question whether the company would like to be introduced to key strategic buyers with whom you have relationships. This not only establishes trust but also your value-add to management.

Just as MBA students prepare for class case studies, board meetings should be approached with that same rigor. Your goal should not be to gather information as an audience; you must be an active, informed participant. You should go into each board meeting with a clear idea of what you would like to achieve. Before each meeting, I try to set two intentions — one external, and one internal. To set the external intention, I list three issues or questions I want discussed. These can serve to recall previous issues from a prior board meeting, and track a company’s progress and hold managers accountable. It’s remarkable how easy it is to forget key topics from last quarter’s board meeting even as the next approaches, especially when managing multiple portfolio companies. Going in with a plan helps prevent that.

My internal intention is an answer to the question: What role do I want to play in this meeting? Do I take a devil’s advocate position to ensure all options are debated? Or is it important for management to feel supported as we approach a difficult reduction in force? Alternatively, should I focus on listening to understand the views of all syndicate investors before communicating my own? My intention for myself often has to do with how I want others to feel, and developing a better awareness has helped my relationships and contributions in the boardroom. When I’ve gone into meetings without an internal intention, I have sometimes come across as not as thoughtful or considerate as I want to be.

In an ideal world, every junior VC would be mentored to become a superb board member. This would begin in an observer role (observers are non-voting participants on a private company’s board) and then as a full-fledged director. In practice, however, people management and mentorship are not always strong suits for seasoned venture capitalists. I was extremely fortunate to engage two strong senior investors as part of my venture capital journey who gave me regular feedback. We would go through key issues prior to each board meeting and a post-mortem analysis afterwards. Reflecting on their stylistic differences, one investor had a superb economy of words. “Keep it pithy!” he’d say, describing his intentional approach to limit his airtime and make just a few salient points. My other mentor tried to show me how he regularly anticipate key issues and voting blocks three to four board meetings prior to a formal vote being taken, ensuring that the firm’s interests were represented.

For the apprenticeship model to work, junior folks need to be creative and proactive in getting the right exposure and resources from the start. Leverage opportunities at your firm, solicit feedback from other board members, and be unwavering in your determination to sharpen your skill set as an observer to become a director. You should see senior board members as opportunities, not obstacles. If leveraged appropriately, they can become your biggest allies, advocates, and sources of institutional knowledge.

We tend to be creatures of habit and orient to that which is known and familiar. Boards operate in a similar manner, especially when it comes to tapping into the “old boys network” to select independent board members or chairs. In addition to familiarity, though, there may also be a strategic component to these selections, as each additional board member dilutes the influence of incumbent members. Thus, it’s a common maneuver to add “known” individuals that are strategically aligned with existing directors to ensure control down the line. However, we need to recognize the addition of new directors as opportunities to bring in different, diverse points of view that will improve governance, problem solving, and the maximization of company value. Diversity isn’t just about doing good — it also makes strong business sense. And it requires a shift in mindset from thinking of diversity as a noun to understanding it as a verb, one that requires intentional, consistent action.

When newer VCs face their first board role, they should take the opportunity to build a more mindful and intentional practice in the boardroom. These actionable tips, when put into practice, can expand your influence, help you support your portfolio companies, and build meaning to your investing practice while deepening your relationships with stakeholders at the table.
