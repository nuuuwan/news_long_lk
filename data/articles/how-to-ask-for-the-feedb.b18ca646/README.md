# How to Ask for the Feedback You Really Need

## Summary ü§ñ

Harvard Business Review (HBR) suggests asking for more specific feedback at work could be beneficial to personal development. The method suggests choosing one development area per quarter and discussing this with the employer and colleagues. Instead of asking for generic feedback, HBR recommends homing in on a specific skill or behaviour within the chosen development area and asking for immediate feedback from observers. A more targeted approach can protect against vague memory recall and bias, as observers are prepared for what to look out for. Moreover, feedback can provoke a defensive reaction if it feels confrontational, and specifying domain creates psychological safety. Following feedback, other areas can then be addressed, and progress reassessed.

When we ask for feedback on our work, we often get poor-quality feedback that‚Äôs not useful or that makes us feel attacked or defensive. Part of the reason is in how we‚Äôre asking for feedback. Most requests are too generic, too open, and too late. The result is that...more

You‚Äôve probably heard of ‚Äúthe gift of feedback,‚Äù but have you ever actually received it? When delivered well, the gift¬†of feedback is candor, and it comes when someone exposes how your behavior affected their own thoughts and feelings ‚Äî for example, ‚ÄúWhen you spoke over me, I felt like my perspective wasn‚Äôt valued.‚Äù

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs more likely that what you‚Äôre receiving is decidedly less valuable (or appealing) than a gift. Instead, what your manager or colleagues pass off as feedback is probably a vague or subjective description of what was good or bad about your behavior, with little or no insight into their subjective thoughts and feelings ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou were rude and interrupted me.‚Äù That‚Äôs not helpful.

Part of why you get poor-quality feedback is how you ask for it. Most requests for feedback are too generic, too open, and too late. The result is that you‚Äôre more likely to get a heap of opinion rather than a helping of insight.

A Three Step Process for Asking for Feedback

Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love it if you could provide some feedback,‚Äù try setting the other person up to add more value by being more prescriptive about what you‚Äôre looking for. Use this three step process, particularly when it comes to setting and achieving your own career goals:

Step 1: Choose one area of personal development per quarter.

Each quarter, reflect on your performance objectives, skills, and ambitions and choose one area that you want to work on. This development goal should be central to what you need to achieve in your role so that you‚Äôre motivated to improve, and so others are keen to help. For example, you might focus on thinking more strategically, being a better team player, or enhancing your executive presence. Discuss this choice with your manager and any other trusted colleagues or mentors who would have insight into the greatest opportunities for your growth. With their input, settle on your development focus.

Step 2: Home in on a specific target skill or behavior within your chosen development area.

Once you have the general area you‚Äôd like to work on, select a specific skill or behavior for the short term. For example, if you‚Äôre working on being more strategic, you might choose to reference your industry competitors more often. Alternatively, if your goal is to be a better team player, you could work on paraphrasing your colleagues ideas and then building your ideas off of theirs. Again, people who know you well or have opportunities to see you in action will have valuable ideas about what areas would be most beneficial for you to work on. Once you‚Äôve decided on your specific target area, that becomes the core of your feedback request.

Step 3: Ask someone to observe you working on your new skill or behavior and share what they thought or felt immediately afterward.

Shape your request in a way that increases the likelihood that you‚Äôll get useful feedback. Remember, you want the person to tell you the subjective impact of your behavior (e.g., when your presentation didn‚Äôt include a SWOT analysis, I lacked context to understand your strategy), not judgment about what they think is ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù (e.g., your presentation was too internally focused). Structure your request as follows: start with your development focus, then specify the target area you‚Äôre working on. Note when the other person might have an opportunity to observe your behavior in action and ask for them to share the impact of your behavior on what they thought or felt. In our example about being more strategic, you might ask, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on being more strategic and, specifically, focusing on our competitive positioning. In our meeting tomorrow, could you note how the competitors I reference impact your perception of me as being more strategic or not?‚Äù

In a nutshell, the process looks like this: development focus, target area, observation opportunity, impact assessment.

Let‚Äôs use the good team player goal to create a second example. You might ask, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on being a better team player and specifically on building upon others‚Äô ideas. At the offsite next week, could you watch for examples of how and when I contribute and let me know how my choices land in terms of being a good team player or not?‚Äù

Now, you‚Äôve set both yourself and the person giving feedback up for a more constructive interaction.

Why Targeted Feedback Requests Work

There are several reasons why a targeted ask is superior to a generic request for feedback.

Most post hoc requests for feedback rely on the person to recall from memory how you behaved and how they reacted, but memory is fallible and highly susceptible to biases. Even without intentional bias, the other person‚Äôs recollections might be vague, and their impressions of what they thought or felt in response to your behavior are likely to be reconstructions. When you ask for feedback in advance and specify the behaviors you‚Äôd like the person to reflect on, the feedback giver knows what to look for and can pay attention, take notes, and be better prepared to provide specific and objective information about what you did, with more insightful reflections on how those choices affected them. Targeted feedback requests increase the validity of the data.

When you ask for feedback without setting boundaries, you give the other person free rein to choose any domain that‚Äôs salient to them. If you ask for feedback about your presentation, you might hear anything from the questionable quality of evidence to the preposterousness of using a purple Pantone. When you‚Äôre specific about what you‚Äôre working on and what valuable perspective the other person might provide, you receive information that‚Äôs timely and pertinent to what you‚Äôre actively working to improve. From a learning perspective, this provides more relevant insights that you can apply immediately. The alternative is opening yourself up to irrelevant feedback that distracts from your focus, or relevant but premature instruction that comes too soon for you to put it into action.

A common problem with most generic feedback is that it comes without warning, or from a direction you aren‚Äôt expecting. The result is that it can feel confrontational, adversarial, and even unsafe. That‚Äôs more likely to trigger your defensiveness and shut down learning rather than fostering openness and a growth mindset. When you exert some control over the topic of the feedback, you can be mentally prepared to hear a negative or uncomfortable message that would otherwise be off-putting or upsetting. Because it‚Äôs an area you‚Äôre working on and paying attention to, it‚Äôs possible that you‚Äôve already realized what they‚Äôre going to tell you ‚Äî you might have even assessed yourself more harshly than they will. The point is that you‚Äôve enlisted help, and your counterpart is delivering feedback as an ally who is invested in your development rather than an adversary who is trying to tear you down. Targeted feedback requests bolster psychological safety.

Creating a Virtuous Cycle

As you make significant progress in one target area, move to the next area within the same development focus. For example, you can evolve your strategic thinking from studying your current competitors to learning from other industries. Each time, take the feedback, reflect on what you‚Äôve learned, make new choices, and then move on to the next target area. After two or three months of dedicated effort on one developmental focus, you‚Äôre ready to move on to another domain.

To select your next quarterly development focus, revisit your past performance reviews and your current developmental plan to identify areas that might be important for you to work on. Take your shortlist and ask for input from others. Remember, you‚Äôre not asking for feedback yet; you‚Äôre not ready to ask for it in a way that will be helpful. Instead, solicit ideas about what your colleagues or manager think might be the next development area for you to begin working on. This is their opportunity to help you see any blind spots. Yet, it does so in a way that‚Äôs safe and manageable because you retain control. Repeat the process so that your manager and colleagues always know how they can contribute constructively to your development.

As organizational psychologist¬†Tasha Eurich taught us, we‚Äôre not as self-aware as we think. ¬†The best remedy is to ask for feedback that helps you understand the impact of your behavior on others. If you frame your request properly, what you get in return is likely to be a gift of candor that supports your growth, strengthens your relationships, and accelerates your career.
