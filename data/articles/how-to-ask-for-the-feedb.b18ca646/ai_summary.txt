Harvard Business Review (HBR) suggests asking for more specific feedback at work could be beneficial to personal development. The method suggests choosing one development area per quarter and discussing this with the employer and colleagues. Instead of asking for generic feedback, HBR recommends homing in on a specific skill or behaviour within the chosen development area and asking for immediate feedback from observers. A more targeted approach can protect against vague memory recall and bias, as observers are prepared for what to look out for. Moreover, feedback can provoke a defensive reaction if it feels confrontational, and specifying domain creates psychological safety. Following feedback, other areas can then be addressed, and progress reassessed.
