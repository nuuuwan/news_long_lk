Elections come and go, yet the rulers remain,

Different shades, playing the same old game—

Deceiving the public, chasing fleeting fame,

For their gain alone, they bear no shame.

Our disillusionment deepens; belief starts to fade,

Even the ‘learned’ join the corruption parade.

Unless we strive for a genuine change,

‘Aragalaya’ risks being a hollow name.

It’s time to see beyond grand facades,

And uproot the culprits who plague our land.

No use dwelling on what’s past and done;

Cast your vote with clarity and hope for the sun.

Think deeply when choosing the guiding light,

Seek virtues that build a fair house of might.

Trust those who listen to our plight—

The honest, selfless, and empathetic bright.

Encourage voices for humanity’s cause,

Beyond colour, gender, or language’s laws.

Reject the ones who spend to dazzle and shine,

Unseen, the source of their golden line.
