Remote work can be a blessing and curse for those just starting their careers. While it has clear benefits (improved work-life balance, geographic flexibility, and eliminating commutes), itâ€™s not without drawbacks. There are unique challenges that come with starting your career remotely: isolation, distractions, and communication gaps. Fortunately, you can overcome these obstacle. Hereâ€™s how.

Isolation: You can eliminate or reduce isolation by visiting a coworking space or a coffee shop, joining a club or intramural sports team, or working from a friend or family memberâ€™s house.

Distractions: Distractions can be avoided by establishing boundaries with those around you and adjusting your environment. You might also try using a dedicated workspace, removing entertainment systems from that space.

Communication gaps: Working remotely limits communication to Slack messages, video meetings, or phone calls. To limit communication gaps, take notes, get clear directions, and review similar past projects for reference.

When I first stepped onto campus as an undergraduate student, I was determined to make as many friends and connections as possible. I wanted to form lifelong memories, and ultimately, forge professional relationships that might help my career. You could find me at almost every seminar, interest meeting, or networking event on campus (and maybe even a party or two).
