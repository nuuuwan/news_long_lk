Facts:

- US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and China's minister of defence, Dong Jun, held a 75-minute meeting on May 31st at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.
- The meeting aimed at re-establishing military communications based on an agreement between US president, Joe Biden, and China’s president, Xi Jinping, in November 2023.
- The last meeting between the countries' defence ministers was nearly two years prior, as China cut communications following a visit by the then-US house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taiwan in August 2022.
- Concrete steps to improve mil-mil communication include resuming telephone conversations among theatre commanders and creating a crisis-communications working group by end-2024.
- Austin underlined the importance of open mil-mil communication and promoted upgrading the US’s “hub and spoke” security model, while Dong defended China's maritime territorial interests.
- Mr. Dong criticized the US for sending a Congressional delegation to the inauguration of Taiwan’s new president, Lai Ching-te, and Mr. Austin criticized China’s military harassment of Taiwan in late May.
- Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr warned that a Philippine citizen killed by China in the South China Sea would be close to an act of war.
- Unlike Taiwan, the Philippines has an explicit defense treaty with the US, which could trigger a direct US-China confrontation.

Opinions:

- The forecast believes the re-establishment of mil-mil communications is a significant step towards ensuring regional stability and de-escalation of conflicts.
- Both US and China still refuse to compromise on core issues, leading the risk outlook for the US-China relationship to remain pessimistic.
- The South China Sea situation is seen as a more likely trigger for US-China conflict than tensions over Taiwan.
- The continuation of US and China competition for regional influence is expected to further complicate security in the Asia-Pacific.
- Despite the renewal of mil-mil talks, the forecast expects China will continue to push for a shift in the cross-Strait status quo, and the US will continue to expand its regional security frameworks.
- Upcoming security dynamics between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea are considered a prominent near-term risk.
- The possible confrontation between China and the Philippines could escalate into a wider regional security incident, although this is not within the core forecast.
