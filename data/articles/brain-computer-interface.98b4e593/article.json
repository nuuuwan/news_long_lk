    "Tech companies are always trying out new ways for people to interact with computers\u2014consider efforts like Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. You\u2019ve probably used at least one. But the most radical option has been tried by fewer than 100 people on Earth\u2014those who have lived for months or years with implanted brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs.  Implanted BCIs are electrodes put in paralyzed people\u2019s brains so they can use imagined movements to send commands from their neurons through a wire, or via radio, to a computer. In this way, they can control a computer cursor or, in few cases, produce speech.\u00a0\u00a0 Recently, this field has taken some strides toward real practical applications. About 25 clinical trials of BCI implants are currently underway. And this year MIT Technology Review readers have selected these brain-computer interfaces as their addition to our annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies, published in January.",
    "BCIs won by a landslide to become the \u201c11th Breakthrough,\u201d as we call it. It beat out three runners-up: continuous glucose monitors, hyperrealistic deepfakes, and methane-detecting satellites.  The impression of progress comes thanks to a small group of companies that are actively recruiting volunteers to try BCIs in clinical trials. They are Neuralink, backed by the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk; New York\u2013based Synchron; and China\u2019s Neuracle Neuroscience.",
    "Each is trialing interfaces with the eventual goal of getting the field\u2019s first implanted BCI approved for sale.\u00a0 \u201cI call it the translation era,\u201d says Michelle Patrick-Krueger, a research scientist who carried out a detailed survey of BCI trials with neuroengineer Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston. \u201cIn the past couple of years there has been considerable private investment. That creates excitement and allows companies to accelerate.\u201d That\u2019s a big change, since for years BCIs have been more like a neuroscience parlor trick, generating lots of headlines but little actual help to patients.\u00a0 Patrick-Krueger says the first time a person controlled a computer cursor from a brain implant was in 1998. That was followed by a slow drip-drip of tests in which university researchers would find a single volunteer, install an implant, and carry out studies for months or years.    Over 26 years, Patrick-Krueger says, she was able to document a grand total of 71 patients who\u2019ve ever controlled a computer directly with their neurons.\u00a0 That means you are more likely to be friends with a Mega Millions jackpot winner than know someone with a BCI. These studies did prove that people could use their neurons to play Pong, move a robot arm, and even speak through a computer. But such demonstrations are of no practical help to people with paralysis severe enough to benefit from a brain-controlled computer, because these implants are not yet widely available.\u00a0 \u201cOne thing is to have them work, and another is how to actually deploy them,\u201d says Contreras-Vidal. \u201cAlso, behind any great news are probably technical issues that need to be addressed.\u201d These include questions about how long an implant will last and how much control it offers patients.",
    "Larger trials from three companies are now trying to resolve these questions and set the groundwork for a real product. One company, Synchron, uses a stent with electrodes on it that\u2019s inserted into a brain vessel via a vein in the neck. Synchron has implanted its \u201cstentrode\u201d in 10 volunteers, six in the US and four in Australia\u2014the most simultaneous volunteers reported by any BCI group.\u00a0 The stentrode collects limited brain signals, so it gives users only a basic on/off type of control signal, or what Synchron calls a \u201cswitch.\u201d That isn\u2019t going to let a paralyzed person use Photoshop. But it\u2019s enough to toggle through software menus or select among prewritten messages. Tom Oxley, Synchron\u2019s CEO, says the advantage of the stentrode is that it is \u201cas simple as possible.\u201d That, he believes, will make his brain-computer interface \u201cscalable\u201d to more people, especially since installing it doesn\u2019t involve brain surgery.\u00a0 Synchron might be ahead, but it\u2019s still in an exploratory phase. A \u201cpivotal\u201d study, the kind used to persuade regulators to allow sales of a specific version of the device, has yet to be scheduled. So there\u2019s no timeline for a product.\u00a0\u00a0 Neuralink, meanwhile, has disclosed that three volunteers have received its implant, the N1, which consists of multiple fine electrode threads inserted directly into the brain through a hole drilled in the skull.\u00a0 More electrodes mean more neural activity is captured. Neuralink\u2019s first volunteer, Noland Arbaugh, has shown off how he can guide a cursor around a screen in two dimensions and click, letting him play video games like Civilization or online chess. Finally, Neuracle says it is running two trials in China and one in the US. Its implant consists of a patch of electrodes placed on top of the brain. In a report, the company said a paralyzed volunteer is using the system to stimulate electrodes in his arm, causing his hand to close in a grasp.",
    "But details remain sparse. A Neuracle executive would only say that \u201cseveral\u201d people had received its implant. Because Neuracle\u2019s patient count isn\u2019t public, it wasn\u2019t included in Patrick-Krueger\u2019s tally. In fact, there\u2019s no information at all in the medical literature on about a quarter of brain-implant volunteers so far, so she counted them using press releases or by e-mailing research teams.",
    "Her BCI survey yielded other insights. According to her data, implants have lasted as long as 15 years, more than half of patients are in the US, and roughly 75% of BCI recipients have been male.\u00a0 The data can\u2019t answer the big question, though. And that is whether implanted BCIs will progress from breakthrough demonstrations into breakout products, the kind that help many people. \u201cIn the next five to 10 years, it\u2019s either going to translate into a product or it\u2019ll still stay in research,\u201d Patrick-Krueger says. \u201cI do feel very confident there will be a breakout.\u201d hide"
