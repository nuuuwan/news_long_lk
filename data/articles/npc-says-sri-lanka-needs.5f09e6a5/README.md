The National Peace Council (NPC) yesterday stressed that Sri Lanka needs a comprehensive solution to alleged war crimes and reconciliation and not selective justice.

In a statement, the NPC said the UK Government’s decision to impose sanctions on four Sri Lankan individuals, including three former military commanders, has ignited significant debate. This move comes at a time when large-scale violence continues unchecked in other parts of the world, raising concerns about the application of different standards to different countries. As a non-partisan civil society organisation, the NPC asserted that the pursuit of truth and accountability must be universal and free from political motivation.

“Justice cannot be applied selectively. It is needed as much in Mullivaikkal and Batalanda, where the violations took place 16 to 37 years ago, as it is in Palestine and Ukraine, where they are taking place today,” the NPC said.

In its statement, the NPC also said the following.

The UK has stated that it is working through the UN Human Rights Council to advance accountability in Sri Lanka. It has affirmed its commitment to supporting Sri Lanka’s human rights reforms. The NPC recognises that unresolved human rights issues have lasting consequences. The recent resurgence of the Batalanda controversy from the JVP insurrection era demonstrates that historical injustices do not simply fade away. Moreover, Sri Lanka risks further economic and political fallout if it fails to address human rights concerns in a comprehensive manner. The potential loss of the European Union’s GSP Plus trade concessions due to human rights concerns threatens the country’s economic stability, highlighting the urgent need for credible action.

However, accountability measures alone cannot resolve the country’s longstanding challenges. Sri Lanka also requires a political solution that addresses the deep-rooted causes of its ethnic conflict. The ethnic war and past mass violence were not merely criminal acts but part of a larger political struggle. Addressing these issues requires moving beyond legalistic measures to a broader political consensus that lays the foundation for long-term stability. Without a negotiated political framework that ensures fair power-sharing and inclusivity, efforts at accountability will be incomplete and risk deepening divisions rather than healing them.

The NPC urges the Government to take necessary action by prioritising a negotiated political settlement. A truth commission that is built on transparency and broad participation and independent of political manipulation would be a vital step, but it must be part of a wider reconciliation process rooted in political consensus. The longer the process is delayed, the more scepticism will grow among victims and the broader public about the Government’s commitment to justice and be seen as deliberate attempts to evade accountability. We believe that a well-structured truth commission, integrated within a larger political reform process, would not only bring justice to victims but also pave the way for lasting peace, reconciliation, and national unity.
