1. 👥 Aseni and Sarath Mahatthaya converse about Sri Lanka's debt and its restructuring plans to achieve sustainability under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility. 
2. ⚖ The conversation addresses various forms of borrowing contributing to Sri Lanka's unsustainable debt, including central government and private sector foreign borrowing. 
3. 📜 On April 12, 2022, the country's unsustainable foreign debt was confirmed when the Ministry of Finance announced the suspension of debt servicing-payment of interest and repayment of the principal.
4. 💱 The Ministry vowed to add the arrears of interest and principal to the original loan at the same interest rate until debt restructuring is completed. 
5. 💰 Talk turns to the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) agreement, revealing only $10 billion debt has been restructured, allowing repayment postponements from 2028 to 2042.
6. 💸 Sri Lanka will pay around 2% interest annually from 2024 to 2027, or about $200 million. With a moratorium on the principal, there is relief for the country during this period. 
7. 🖊 The IMF anticipates debt forgiveness of about $14 billion (about 51% of total restructuring debt), suggesting Sri Lanka should receive a similar "haircut" to resolve its debt problem permanently. 
8. 🌐 It's disclosed that no hard and fast rule states a creditor will not agree to a haircut of the principal loan, with examples of the Paris Club offering debt forgiveness in the past. 
9. 🇨🇳 However, China does not provide haircuts to its borrowers as a policy, suggesting Sri Lanka has not received such relief from China. 
10. 🧾 Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana's statement that debt is being negotiated not on a haircut of the principal but on the relief provided through a lower net present value of future foreign exchange outflows is both right and wrong. It fails to provide relief to a country in a debt trap and relies on choosing an arbitrary discount rate.
