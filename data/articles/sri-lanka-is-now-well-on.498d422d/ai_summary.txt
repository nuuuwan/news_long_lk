Facts:
- Sri Lanka has firmly decided to incorporate nuclear energy into its energy mix.
- The SLAEB (Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board) Chairman, Prof. Rexy Denzil Rosa, affirmed that nuclear energy is considered a clean and green energy source to fulfill the country's future electricity demand.
- In March 2024, the Sri Lankan Cabinet made a commitment to a nuclear power program, which the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) noted would increase low carbon power production, fight climate change, and bolster energy security.
- The IAEA conducted a safety review of potential nuclear site locations from May 30 to June 5, and Sri Lanka identified six "candidate sites" for evaluation.
- In 2022, President Ranil Wickremesinghe urged the country to seriously think about nuclear power to address power shortages.
- Potential international collaborators include Russia, the US, Denmark, China, and India, all of which have offered assistance in establishing a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) costing about $2 billion.
- The SMR model, which yields around 100 MW, was deemed "inherently safe" and low-risk by Prof. Rosa.
- By 2031, Sri Lanka aims to generate 6,000 MW of nuclear power. 
- Prof. Rosa justified the shift to nuclear power by citing the unreliability of solar and wind energy and the aim to eliminate coal usage by 2030.
- Russia dominates the global market in nuclear material and has initiated the construction of 19 reactors between 2012 and 2021. 

Opinions:
- The benefits of adopting nuclear energy outweigh the drawbacks, according to literature on the topic. 
- Prof. Rexy Denzil Rosa describes nuclear energy as a superior option due to solar and wind energy being “intermittent, unstable, and seasonal."
- According to a report from the U.S. Office of Nuclear Energy, nuclear power plants are easier to maintain and are designed for longer operation periods before refuelling.
- An academic study by researchers from Colombo University and the Government of Sri Lanka, argues advancement in nuclear power plant technologies has made them much safer and more economical in the long run. 
- Physics World states nuclear power is ‘hundreds of times’ safer than coal, gas, and oil. 
- According to www.world-nuclear.org, the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is minute in relation to other thermal electricity generation technologies.
- Kristyna Foltynova of Radio Free Europe claims that Russia has a strong hold on the market for nuclear material, making other nations dependent on its supplies, even in times of conflict.
- Prof. Rosa believes that Russia's offer to handle nuclear waste makes its proposal worth considering.
- Russia provides a comprehensive 'package solution', which includes the construction of nuclear plants, fuel supply, training of local specialists, safety assistance, scholarship programmes and waste disposal, making it an attractive partner for Sri Lanka.
