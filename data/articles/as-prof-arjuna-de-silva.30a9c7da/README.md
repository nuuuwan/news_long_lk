He is the first person many would call in a medical emergency, knowing he will be there without hesitation

I first met Professor Arjuna De Silva as his patient. I was immediately impressed by this consultant physician, especially by his considerable knowledge, remarkable efficiency and commitment. I also remember thinking that he was a bit arrogant, even bordering on the rude. He was just being matter-of-fact, strictly focused on diagnosis, prognosis and prescription. In the 25 years that have passed since then, I have had ample reason to conclude that behind the confident and sometimes stern exterior that I first encountered, there was a sensitive, intelligent, and scrupulously honest friend just waiting to be discovered.

Over the years this no-nonsense physician, affectionately known as Prof. Arjuna, became one of my closest and dearest friends. His selfless service to our circle, especially his steadfast care for our parents, is nothing short of heroic. The dedication with which he looked after my own parents, particularly my late father, speaks volumes about his loyalty and kindness. In fact, if there was an Olympic medal for “Friendship and Care,” Arjuna would be standing proudly on the podium, gold medal and a bouquet of roses, probably delivering an acceptance speech explaining why he deserves it more than anyone else!

We became firm friends and eventually our brotherhood would include a third, Johann Wijesinghe. The three of us shared a bond tested in the toughest of times. When Johann fell seriously ill, Arjuna stepped up not just as a friend but as a guiding light. Emotionally shaken though he was, Arjuna managed to steer Johann and his wife Kalpana through complex medical treatments while keeping the rest of us, who were understandably anxious, calm and hopeful. Watching him juggle this immense responsibility without panicking was nothing short of inspiring. It was only when Johann passed away that I was able to see him with his guard down; I had never seen Arjuna so deeply shaken before.

His sobriety in his professional life was quite in contrast to how he was when he put aside his ‘doctoring.’ It is no exaggeration to say that I have never met any medical professional who parties like Arjuna does. Arjuna and his wife Thulani are the ultimate hosts; they are supreme when it comes to hospitality and entertainment. Arjuna loves company and celebrations so much that I often joke that if there is a lot of light and music Arjuna would be there or should be. He wouldn’t miss these things if he could help it.

An Oxford-qualified professor, Arjuna’s achievements are nothing short of extraordinary. His contributions to sports, both specific disciplines and the broader sporting community, cannot be matched by any doctor I know. A proud Thomian, he embodies grit, determination, and just the right touch of flair that has earned him the affectionate nickname “Dr. Shahrukh Khan.” And yes, he encourages it with that charming smile and a mischievous wink.

Arjuna isn’t one to wear his emotions on his sleeve, but as a very close friend, I can vouch for his sensitivity and sometimes even a need for attention. Those close to him know he has his weaknesses, for example his legendary reluctance to forgive easily. Arjuna remembers both the good and the bad. For all this, he is the first person many would call in a medical emergency, knowing he will be there without hesitation. I will never forget how he visited my father almost every single day when he became critically ill.

Above all, Arjuna is a proud and loyal Sri Lankan, a true patriot in every sense.

My dear friend Arjuna knows how sorry I am that I cannot be with him tonight as he celebrates the milestone of reaching 60. However, as we have joked and agreed, his party would be better without me for I share his weakness to be unforgiving at times. He will have a blast, nevertheless, for Arjuna is irrepressible. He will take note and smile when I wish him a wonderful time. It will be a blast, as always and Arjuna will enjoy every moment and raise a cheer with those present with a nod to those who, like me, are not there, to many more years of friendship, laughter, and unforgettable memories!

Happy 60th, Prof. Arjuna!
