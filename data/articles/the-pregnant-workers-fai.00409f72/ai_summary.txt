The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the US issued final regulations to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA). This federal law mandates employers to reasonably accommodate for pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. The law covers all health needs arising during this period. Such accommodations can include additional lunch breaks for breastfeeding or allowing schedule changes for IVF appointments. Employers are also obligated to provide changes once an employee informs them of their condition and the need for accommodations relating to it. Employers may also need to provide medical documentation if necessary. Violation of the PWFA is regarded as interference with the employee's rights, imposing unnecessary delay, or a form of retaliation. The law was designed to allow pregnant employees to continue working as long as they wish to, and to maintain their health during pregnancy.
