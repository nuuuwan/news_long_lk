1. 📰Sri Lanka, grappling with a severe economic crisis, has initiated discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. 📉
2. 📑IMF has proposed tax reforms including a nationwide property tax, wealth tax, and wealth transfer taxes as part of the EFF program to help Sri Lanka reach a primary fiscal surplus of 2.3% of GDP by 2025.💰
3. 😕However, recent government statements suggest potential differences in approach to the IMF's framework, particularly regarding the need for a wider tax net with progressive rates. 💬
4. 💼The cabinet has approved implementing the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT) and other agreed tax measures, which is pending parliamentary approval. 🏛️
5. 🔄IRIT, which taxes assumed rental income homeowners could earn by renting out their homes, replaces the originally planned nationwide property tax and wealth transfer tax. 🏠➡️💵 
6. 🏦The shift to IRIT was majorly due to constitutional constraints on revenue sharing between local and central governments and the lack of adequate information on property values. 🚧
7. ⏳Per the IMF report, IRIT will be introduced before the beginning of the tax year on 1 April 2025. 📅
8. 🗂️Administrative arrangements for the successful implementation of IRIT include establishing a database on property valuation, creation of a digital Sales Price and Rents Register (SPRR), and amending the Notaries Act. 💻
9. 🎯While IMF provides a structure for the proposed IRIT, Sri Lankan policymakers hint at potential deviations, including an exemption for primary residences. 🏠✔️
10. 📚Though there may be changes to the rigorous timelines for implementing the required administrative infrastructure, it's expected that a new tax will be added to Sri Lanka’s tax system. ⌛🔄
