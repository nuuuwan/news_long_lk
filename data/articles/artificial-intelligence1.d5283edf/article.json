    " It\u2019s a hell of a time to have a conscience if you work in tech. The ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza has brought the stakes of Silicon Valley\u2019s military contracts into stark relief. Meanwhile, corporate leadership has embraced a no-politics-in-the-workplace policy enforced at the point of the knife. Workers are caught in the middle. Do I take a stand and risk my job, my health insurance, my visa, my family\u2019s home? Or do I ignore my suspicion that my work may be contributing to the murder of innocents on the other side of the world?\u00a0\u00a0  No one can make that choice for you. But I can say with confidence born of experience that such choices can be more easily made if workers know what exactly the companies they work for are doing with militaries at home and abroad. And I also know this: those same companies themselves will never reveal this information unless they are forced to do so\u2014or someone does it for them.\u00a0 For those who doubt that workers can make a difference in how trillion-dollar companies pursue their interests, I\u2019m here to remind you that we\u2019ve done it before. In 2017, I played a part in the successful #CancelMaven campaign that got Google to end its participation in Project Maven, a contract with the US Department of Defense to equip US military drones with artificial intelligence. I helped bring to light information that I saw as critically important and within the bounds of what anyone who worked for Google, or used its services, had a right to know. The information I released\u2014about how Google had signed a contract with the DOD to put AI technology in drones and later tried to misrepresent the scope of that contract, which the company\u2019s management had tried to keep from its staff and the general public\u2014was a critical factor in pushing management to cancel the contract. As #CancelMaven became a rallying cry for the company\u2019s staff and customers alike, it became impossible to ignore.\u00a0 ",
    "Today a similar movement, organized under the banner of the coalition No Tech for Apartheid, is targeting Project Nimbus, a joint contract between Google and Amazon to provide cloud computing infrastructure and AI capabilities to the Israeli government and military. As of May 10, just over 97,000 people had signed its petition calling for an end to collaboration between Google, Amazon, and the Israeli military. I\u2019m inspired by their efforts and dismayed by Google\u2019s response. Earlier this month the company fired 50 workers it said had been involved in \u201cdisruptive activity\u201d demanding transparency and accountability for Project Nimbus. Several were arrested. It was a decided overreach.\u00a0\u00a0 Google is very different from the company it was seven years ago, and these firings are proof of that. Googlers today are facing off with a company that, in direct response to those earlier worker movements, has fortified itself against new demands. But every Death Star has its thermal exhaust port, and today Google has the same weakness it did back then: dozens if not hundreds of workers with access to information it wants to keep from becoming public.\u00a0 ",
    "Not much is known about the Nimbus contract. It\u2019s worth $1.2 billion and enlists Google and Amazon to provide wholesale cloud infrastructure and AI for the Israeli government and its ministry of defense. Some brave soul leaked a document to Time last month, providing evidence that Google and Israel negotiated an expansion of the contract as recently as March 27 of this year. We also know, from reporting by The Intercept, that Israeli weapons firms are required by government procurement guidelines to buy their cloud services from Google and Amazon.\u00a0 Leaks alone won\u2019t bring an end to this contract. The #CancelMaven victory required a sustained focus over many months, with regular escalations, coordination with external academics and human rights organizations, and extensive internal organization and discipline. Having worked on the public policy and corporate comms teams at Google for a decade, I understood that its management does not care about one negative news cycle or even a few of them. Management buckled only after we were able to keep up the pressure and escalate our actions (leaking internal emails, reporting new info about the contract, etc.) for over six months.\u00a0 The No Tech for Apartheid campaign seems to have the necessary ingredients. If a strategically placed insider released information not otherwise known to the public about the Nimbus project, it could really increase the pressure on management to rethink its decision to get into bed with a military that\u2019s currently overseeing mass killings of women and children. My decision to leak was deeply personal and a long time in the making. It certainly wasn\u2019t a spontaneous response to an op-ed, and I don\u2019t presume to advise anyone currently at Google (or Amazon, Microsoft, Palantir, Anduril, or any of the growing list of companies peddling AI to militaries) to follow my example.\u00a0 However, if you\u2019ve already decided to put your livelihood and freedom on the line, you should take steps to try to limit your risk. This whistleblower guide is helpful. You may even want to reach out to a lawyer before choosing to share information.\u00a0 In 2017, Google was nervous about how its military contracts might affect its public image. Back then, the company responded to our actions by defending the nature of the contract, insisting that its Project Maven work was strictly for reconnaissance and not for weapons targeting\u2014conceding implicitly that helping to target drone strikes would be a bad thing. (An aside: Earlier this year the Pentagon confirmed that Project Maven, which is now a Palantir contract, had been used in targeting drone attacks in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.)\u00a0 Today\u2019s Google has wrapped its arms around the American flag, for good or ill. Yet despite this embrace of the US military, it doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a company responsible for illegal killings. Today it maintains that the work it is doing as part of Project Nimbus \u201cis not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\u201d At the same time, it asserts that there is no room for politics at the workplace and has fired those demanding transparency and accountability. This raises a question: If Google is doing nothing sensitive as part of the Nimbus contract, why is it firing workers who are insisting that the company reveal what work the contract actually entails?\u00a0\u00a0 As you read this, AI is helping Israel annihilate Palestinians by expanding the list of possible targets beyond anything that could be compiled by a human intelligence effort, according to +972 Magazine. Some Israel Defense Forces insiders are even sounding the alarm, calling it a dangerous \u201cmass assassination program.\u201d The world has not yet grappled with the implications of the proliferation of AI weaponry, but that is the trajectory we are on. It\u2019s clear that absent sufficient backlash, the tech industry will continue to push for military contracts. It\u2019s equally clear that neither national governments nor the UN is currently willing to take a stand.\u00a0 It will take a movement. A document that clearly demonstrates Silicon Valley\u2019s direct complicity in the assault on Gaza could be the spark. Until then, rest assured that tech companies will continue to make as much money as possible developing the deadliest weapons imaginable.\u00a0 William Fitzgerald is a founder and partner at the Worker Agency, an advocacy agency in California.
