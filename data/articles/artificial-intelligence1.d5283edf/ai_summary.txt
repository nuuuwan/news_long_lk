The article, written by an ex-Google employee, discusses the moral conundrum faced by tech workers whose companies hold military contracts. The writer highlights their experience with the 2017 #CancelMaven campaign, which successfully got Google to terminate its participation in Project Maven, an artificial intelligence (AI) contract with the US Department of Defense for military drones. This has drawn parallels to Project Nimbus, a joint contract between Google and Amazon to provide cloud computing infrastructure and AI to the Israeli government and military, which has attracted a similar protest under the banner No Tech for Apartheid. The campaign has over 97,000 signatories, but Google has responded by firing 50 employees allegedly linked to “disruptive activity” related to the project. The piece argues for increased information transparency about the nature and extent of such contracts and encourages workers to push for this.
