The article discusses the construction issues and subsequent collapse of a concrete beam on the Central Expressway in Sri Lanka, a part of a larger project aimed at creating an expressway network. The collapse of a beam on the Central Expressway, caused by the deterioration of a rubber pad used during installation, has raised significant concerns about the quality and safety of the construction. The project, overseen by the Road Development Authority (RDA) but executed by Metalogical Corporation China (MCC), faced delays and issues from the start. The first phase commenced officially in 2020, despite an initial start date in 2016.

During construction, concerns were already prominent due to a prior incident in 2008 where a medical student died from a minor bridge collapse, highlighting fears regarding safety standards. The cost of replicating the affected beams, 66 million rupees for three beams, raises financial concerns, compounded by who ultimately bears responsibility for the failure â€“ the construction company (MCC), or the Sri Lankan Government. Testing is currently being carried out to verify the quality of the remaining beams, with potential losses in billions if further issues are confirmed.

The article highlights the uncertainty over who should assume responsibility: MCC, the RDA, or the government. Ensuring proper inspection and adherence to quality standards during construction is critical. The article underscores the stringent requirements for quality control in such infrastructure projects and highlights past issues with similar governmental agreements, hinting at systemic flaws in managing large-scale construction contracts.
