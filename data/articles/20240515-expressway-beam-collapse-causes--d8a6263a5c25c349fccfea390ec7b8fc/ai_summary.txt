- Construction of the Kottawa to Pinnaduwa expressway network in Sri Lanka completed in 2011.
- A minor bridge collapse during 2008 construction led to a student’s death and raised concerns about expressway safety.
- Improper bridge construction was identified as the cause of the 2008 collapse.

- On May 4, a concrete beam collapsed in the Kadawatha to Mirigama section of the Central Expressway.
- The collapsed beam was part of the expressway built on piers between Magalegoda and Bemmulla.
- The Central Expressway project, overseen by the Ministry of Highways and Road Development Authority (RDA), was contracted to Metalogical Corporation China (MCC) and budgeted at 196,174 million rupees.
- Financial backing for the project included a loan from EXIM Bank of China, with specific terms for commencement and delays.

- The beam that collapsed in May 2023 was installed in 2021.
- Concerns have been raised over the quality of the project due to the collapse before the expressway’s completion.
- Costs for each concrete beam are about 22 million rupees, with three beams damaged in the collapse incurring approximately 66 million rupees in losses.
- There are estimates of billions in potential losses if a larger portion of the beams proves substandard.

- The RDA and MCC dispute who should bear the financial responsibility for the collapse.
- The RDA insists MCC should cover the losses since the project has not been officially transferred to the RDA yet.
- Initial findings suggest that the beam collapse was due to a deteriorating rubber pad used in its installation.

- There are ongoing inspections and tests for the entire stretch of expressway constructed using concrete beams.
- Previous incidents, such as the contaminated fertilizer shipment from China, suggest potential complications in recovering losses or obtaining replacements.
- Conversations with engineers emphasize the importance of thorough quality checks and adherence to project specifications.
