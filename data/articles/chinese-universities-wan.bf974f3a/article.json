    "Just two years ago, Lorraine He, now a 24-year-old law student,\u00a0 was told to avoid using AI for her assignments. At the time, to get around a national block on ChatGPT, students had to buy a mirror-site version from a secondhand marketplace. Its use was common, but it was at best tolerated and more often frowned upon. Now, her professors no longer warn students against using AI. Instead, they\u2019re encouraged to use it\u2014as long as they follow best practices. She is far from alone. Just like those in the West, Chinese universities are going through a quiet revolution. According to a recent survey by the Mycos Institute, a Chinese higher-education research group, the use of generative AI on campus has become nearly universal. The same survey reports that just 1% of university faculty and students in China reported never using AI tools in their studies or work. Nearly 60% said they used them frequently\u2014either multiple times a day or several times a week.  However, there\u2019s a crucial difference. While many educators in the West see AI as a threat they have to manage, more Chinese classrooms are treating it as a skill to be mastered. In fact, as the Chinese-developed model DeepSeek gains in popularity globally, people increasingly see it as a source of national pride. The conversation in Chinese universities has gradually shifted from worrying about the implications for academic integrity to encouraging literacy, productivity, and staying ahead.\u00a0 The cultural divide is even more apparent in public sentiment. A report on global AI attitudes from Stanford University\u2019s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) found that China leads the world in enthusiasm. About 80% of Chinese respondents said they were \u201cexcited\u201d about new AI services\u2014compared with just 35% in the US and 38% in the UK.",
    "\u201cThis attitude isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d says Fang Kecheng, a professor in communications at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition in China of believing in technology as a driver of national progress, tracing back to the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping was already saying that science and technology are primary productive forces.\u201d From taboo to toolkit Liu Bingyu, one of He\u2019s professors at the China University of Political Science and Law, says AI can act as \u201cinstructor, brainstorm partner, secretary, and devil\u2019s advocate.\u201d She added a full session on AI guidelines to her lecture series this year, after the university encouraged \u201cresponsible and confident\u201d use of AI.",
    "Liu recommends that students use generative AI to write literature reviews, draft abstracts, generate charts, and organize thoughts. She\u2019s created slides that lay out detailed examples of good and bad prompts, along with one core principle: AI can\u2019t replace human judgment. \u201cOnly high-quality input and smart prompting can lead to good results,\u201d she says. Related StoryAI\u2019s giants want to take over the classroomOpenAI and Anthropic say AI can help students learn\u2014not just cheat\u2014even if real-world use suggests otherwise.",
    "\u201cThe ability to interact with machines is one of the most important skills in today\u2019s world,\u201d Liu told her class. \u201cAnd instead of having students do it privately, we should talk about it out in the open.\u201d This reflects a growing trend across the country. MIT Technology Review reviewed the AI strategies of 46 top Chinese universities and found that almost all of them have added interdisciplinary AI general\u2011education classes, AI related degree programs and AI literacy modules in the past year. Tsinghua, for example, is establishing a new undergraduate general education college to train students in AI plus another traditional discipline, like biology, healthcare, science, or humanities. Major institutions like Remin, Nanjing, and Fudan Universities have rolled out general-access AI courses and degree programs that are open to all students, not reserved for computer science majors like the traditional machine-learning classes. At Zhejiang University, an introductory AI class will become mandatory for undergraduates starting in 2024.\u00a0  Lin Shangxin, principal of Renmin University of China recently told local media that AI was an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d for humanities and social sciences. \u201cIntead of a challenge, I believe AI would empower humanities studies,\u201d Lin said told The Paper. The collective action echoes a central government push. In April 2025, the Ministry of Education released new national guidelines calling for sweeping \u201cAI+ education\u201d reforms, aimed at cultivating critical thinking, digital fluency, and real\u2010world skills at all education levels. Earlier this year, the Beijing municipal government mandated AI education across all schools in the city\u2014from universities to K\u201312. Fang believes that more formal AI literacy education will help bridge an emerging divide between students. \u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in digital literacy,\u201d he says. \u201cSome students are fluent in AI tools. Others are lost.\u201d Building the AI university In the absence of Western tools like ChatGPT and Claude, many Chinese universities have begun deploying local versions of DeepSeek on campus servers to support students. Many top universities have deployed their own locally hosted versions of Deepseek. These campus-specific AI systems\u2013often referred to as the \u201cfull-blood version\u201d of Deepseek\u2014offer longer context windows, unlimited dialogue rounds and broader functionality than public-facing free versions.",
    "Related StoryHow DeepSeek became a fortune teller for China\u2019s youthAI-powered BaZi analysis has become the new oracle for a disillusioned generation seeking answers.",
    "This mirrors a broader trend in the West, where companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are rolling out campus-wide education tiers\u2014OpenAI recently offered free ChatGPT Plus to all U.S. and Canadian college students, while Anthropic launched Claude for Education with partners like Northeastern and LSE. But in China, the initiative is typically university-led rather than driven by the companies themselves. The goal, according to Zhejiang University, is to offer students full access to AI tools so they can stay up to date with the fast-changing technology. Students can use their ID to access the models for free.\u00a0 Yanyan Li and Meifang Zhuo, two researchers at Warwick University who have studied students\u2019 use of AI at universities in the UK, believe that AI literacy education has become crucial to students\u2019 success.\u00a0 With their colleague Gunisha Aggarwal, they conducted focus groups including college students from different backgrounds and levels to find out how AI is used in academic studies. They found that students\u2019 knowledge of how to use AI comes mainly from personal exploration. \u201cWhile most students understand that AI output is not always trustworthy, we observed a lot of anxiety on how to use it right,\u201d says Li. \u201cThe goal shouldn\u2019t be preventing students from using AI but guiding them to harness it for effective learning and higher-order thinking,\u201d says Zhuo.\u00a0 That lesson has come slowly. A student at Central China Normal University in Wuhan told MIT Technology Review that just a year ago, most of his classmates paid for mirror websites of ChatGPT, using VPNs or semi-legal online marketplaces to access Western models. \u201cNow, everyone just uses DeepSeek and Doubao,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper, it works in Chinese, and no one\u2019s worried about getting flagged anymore.\u201d Still, even with increased institutional support, many students feel anxious about whether they\u2019re using AI correctly\u2014or ethically. The use of AI detection tools has created an informal gray economy, where students pay hundreds of yuan to freelancers promising to \u201cAI-detection-proof\u201d their writing, according to a Rest of World report. Three students told MIT Technology Review that this environment has created confusion, stress, and increased anxiety. Across the board, they said they appreciate it when their professor offers clear policies and practical advice, not just warnings. He, the law student in Beijing, recently joined a career development group to learn more AI skills to prepare for the job market. To many like her, understanding how to use AI better is not just a studying hack but a necessary skill in China\u2019s fragile job market. Eighty percent of job openings available to fresh graduates listed AI-related skills as a plus in 2025, according to a report by the Chinese media outlet YiCai. In a slowed-down economy and a competitive job market, many students see AI as a lifeline.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe need to rethink what is considered \u2018original work\u2019 in the age of AI\u201d says Zhuo, \u201cand universities are a crucial site of that conversation\u201d. hide"
