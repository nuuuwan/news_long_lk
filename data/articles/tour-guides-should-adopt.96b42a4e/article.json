    "Maricar Donato with members of SLINTGL",
    "Maricar Donato welcomed by SLINTGL President Janaka Dunusinghe",
    "Maricar Donato with the traditional Kandyan dancers",
    "Amid the vibrant beats of traditional drums, spirited dancers, and the echo of conch shells unique to Sri Lanka, Maricar Donato, the Global Brand Ambassador of the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations (WFTGA), received a warm and ceremonial welcome from the Sri Lanka Institute of National Tour Guide Lecturers (SLINTGL) on December 3, 2024.",
    "Donato, reflecting on her previous visit to Sri Lanka in 2018, shared her desire to return to connect with SLINTGL and express gratitude for their continued membership in the WFTGA. Highlighting the value of the Federation, she emphasised its potential to elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s tour guiding standards to international levels. \u201cWe have a lot to offer to our members, and they need to take full advantage of it. From networking events to training programmes, there is so much available\u2014but you must be proactive to reap the benefits,\u201d she remarked.",
    "Joining the event virtually from Vienna, Austria, WFTGA President Sebastian Frankenberger expressed appreciation for Sri Lanka\u2019s long-standing commitment to the Federation. He underscored the evolving role of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the tour-guiding profession. \u201cTour guides must now integrate AI skills to take their services to the next level,\u201d he noted, adding that Sri Lanka could consider bidding to host the 2028 WFTGA Convention.",
    "Warmly welcoming Donato, SLINTGL President Janaka Dunusinghe, acknowledged the organisation\u2019s missed opportunities in utilising WFTGA\u2019s resources since becoming a member in 2012. \u201cThis has been a shortcoming on our part,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHowever, it is high time we strengthen our collaboration. Tourism is more vital to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy now than ever before, especially after the pandemic, the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, and the economic crisis. As tour guides, we have a crucial role to play in rebuilding the industry,\u201d he added. Dunusinghe further highlighted the immense potential of WFTGA membership in enhancing the tourism sector and raising the bar for tour guiding in Sri Lanka.",
    "Donato also found time to sit with the Daily Mirror for an interview to share her insights into the opportunities offered to the tourism industry today, the importance of cultural exchange, and the evolving landscape of travel in a post-pandemic world.",
    "Following are excerpts of the interview:",
    "Q\u00a0 What brings you to Sri Lanka?",
    "I visited Sri Lanka in 2018, and this time, my dream was to actually travel to the Maldives since I hadn\u2019t been there before; then, I also quickly decided to visit Sri Lanka again. I wanted to reconnect with my friends at the SLINTGL and explore more of Sri Lanka.",
    "As the Global Ambassador of the WFTGA, visiting the SLINTGL was an important part of my itinerary. Whenever I travel, I make it a point to connect with local associations, and so I thought this was my time to come and say hello and thank the SLINTGL for being a WFTGA member for 12 years.",
    "Also, I haven\u2019t been to the elephant orphanage, so that\u2019s on my list. My itinerary includes visiting places I missed last time, and of course, visiting the tea plantations. I absolutely love Ceylon tea.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0How do you take your tea?",
    "I take it black. I drink Ceylon Tea five times a day in Washington. It cleanses me, and I find it purifying.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell us about your journey from the Philippines to establishing WashingTours & Events in Washington, DC?",
    "I was born in the Philippines. When I was young, after college\u2014around the age of 22\u2014I left the Philippines and moved to New York, where I lived for three years. After that, I went to France and worked as an au pair, which is something like a babysitter.",
    "When my father was dying, I returned to the Philippines. Then, I got a job with Air France, which opened doors for me in the world of tourism. I had the opportunity to travel extensively. I later met a French guy, and moved back to Paris, where I lived for seven years.",
    "Eventually, I relocated to Washington, DC, where I worked as a travel counselor at American Express at the World Bank. After being laid off in 1994, I decided to start my own company, WashingTours & Events, in 1997.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0As a female in this field, did you face gender discrimination in the early days?",
    "No, I didn\u2019t. I believe it\u2019s very much a cultural thing. I live in the US, where women have the right to speak, and we have a lot of female tourist guides. However, here in Sri Lanka, I was surprised to see that there are very few female tourist guides\u2014it\u2019s a field that is very male-dominated here.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0Since you train tour guides, do you see a lower percentage of female tour guides joining the field globally?",
    "No, the issue is not so much about gender but about age. We don\u2019t see many young people joining the field. Most of the guides are older, often retired individuals who have a steady income, pensions, or rich husbands. Guiding isn\u2019t a stable profession \u2014 especially if you speak only one language \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t attract the younger generation.",
    "I\u2019ve been actively trying to improve this situation. I talk to schools and visit tourism schools. The school where I graduated, George Washington University, has a large number of tourism students in its master\u2019s programme. I\u2019ve spoken to them, invited them to join tours, and told them that we need guides who speak languages. However, younger people need a stable income, which guiding doesn\u2019t provide. Tours are seasonal, and a guiding salary alone isn\u2019t sufficient to live on, especially in the U.S. So, they often opt for other stable careers, such as IT or similar fields.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0In previous interviews, you\u2019ve called this profession of tour guiding \u2018a calling.\u2019 Is there any particular reason for that?",
    "It\u2019s a calling because you\u2019re born to serve\u2014that\u2019s how I feel. It\u2019s a calling because you don\u2019t mind the long hours or being with people for extended periods, answering their questions. You have the potential to change their lives. For instance, when I guide young students, there\u2019s a chance to inspire them and touch their hearts.",
    "I believe that\u2019s my purpose in life. When we reflect on our purpose, mine is to serve. I serve my church, my family, and my community. I consider myself a servant leader.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0This year\u2019s World Tourism Day theme was \u2018Tourism and Peace\u2019. How does peace connect with tourism?",
    "Peace, equality and justice were the key themes this year. It\u2019s peace through guiding. We are even doing a podcast on this, especially now that we have many wars going on. How are guides coping? We are interviewing guides from conflict and war zones to understand how they handle it and what stories they share with guests.",
    "I\u2019m also seeking symbols of peace. For instance, I\u2019m visiting a church that was targeted during the Easter Sunday attacks. I\u2019ll be interviewing people there and exploring the symbols of peace that emerged after the 2019 attack and the tragic loss of life. I want to understand where peace can be found.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think Sri Lanka is doing alright in terms of tourism after the pandemic and economic crisis?",
    "I think so. With the right tools, Sri Lanka can move forward. The world is rapidly evolving with technology\u2014AI, for example\u2014and Sri Lanka can\u2019t remain stagnant. Product development and unique experiences are key.",
    "I experienced this firsthand in the Maldives. The concept of the underwater hotel was amazing. Unfortunately, it was closed when I visited, but the idea of dining under the Indian Ocean was incredible.",
    "When I was in Sri Lanka in January 2018, I designed my own itinerary. I wanted to see various local rituals. So I was dressed in a saree at 4 a.m. to prepare me to attend a local festival. I was taken to a local home where I saw the food being cooked, and I sat together and ate with the family. For me, that was amasing because I was involved in these rituals and traditions.",
    "The more Sri Lanka can offer these types of authentic, local experiences, the better it will sell. Tourism is already saturated with historical sites, and sometimes, I\u2019m not interested in history because I can easily Google it\u2013 I don\u2019t need to pay a guide for it. But I would happily pay for the chance to attend a wedding or witness the washing of clothes in the river, for example. I love seeing these cultural practices up close.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0Sri Lanka had nearly 1.5 million tourists in 2023, and so far in 2024, it has passed 1.6 million tourist arrivals. How can Sri Lanka promote local tourism annually better?",
    "Well, being strong on social media is key. The Ministry of Tourism should focus on that and improve on their marketing. Guides also need to improve their communication, and invite people to visit Sri Lanka through podcasts or interviews, and increase their online presence. Also, hotels should maintain standards. As someone who travels frequently, I know how important this is to attract tourists.",
    "Training guides is also essential. I train tourist guides through the WFTGA across the globe, focusing on social media, guidance and skills.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0Are you hoping to train guides from Sri Lanka as well?",
    "If you ask me to, I can.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0What are some unique strengths you see in Sri Lanka as a tourism destination?",
    "You have a lot of culture, traditions and rituals. I have never experienced the welcoming parade that I received today. So you have to play on these rituals and traditions.",
    "At the same time, the guide has to interpret these rituals and traditions to me, because I didn\u2019t know what all the drumming and lighting of candles meant. So the guides need to interpret that.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0So what are the benefits that Sri Lanka can enjoy by continuing to be a part of this federation?",
    "Sri Lanka has access to valuable networking opportunities and a variety of training programmes through the Federation. We hold many online meetings, and it\u2019s important for Sri Lanka to actively participate in them. The Federation offers numerous benefits to its members, but it\u2019s up to the members to take full advantage of them. Being proactive is key\u2014this is the advice I would give.",
    "We have a convention scheduled for 2026 in Japan, and we would love to see Sri Lanka there. Sri Lanka should also bid to host the 2028 convention.",
    "Q\u00a0\u00a0Any concluding words?",
    "My message is simple: Be kind to one another. This is the year of tourism, and while it has been a challenging period for many, especially after Covid, we\u2019re beginning to return to pre-pandemic numbers.",
    "My advice is to continue the hard work, but make it smarter. Embrace technology\u2014if AI is the key, learn how to use it to enhance your work, whether it\u2019s in developing stories or crafting commentaries. It\u2019s essential to adapt.",
    "For example, tomorrow I\u2019m visiting the church affected by the Easter Sunday bombing. I want to interview someone there to understand how peace has been restored after the attack. That\u2019s the story I\u2019m aiming to capture. The message, above all, is peace\u2014peace for everyone through guiding."
