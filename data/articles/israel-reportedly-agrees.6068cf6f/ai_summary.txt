Israel has reportedly agreed to resume talks on the Gaza crisis amid international pressure and widespread support for Palestine. Israel, the United States, and Qatar have agreed to renew talks on a hostage deal and truce with Hamas. The fresh negotiations will be based on a new outline negotiated in Paris by CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Chief David Barnea, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. Earlier, Israel insisted that Hamas must be defeated or annihilated before any ceasefire could be implemented. Last Saturday, Israel ignored orders from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to stop its military actions. On Wednesday, Ireland, Norway, and Spain announced their recognition of a Palestinian State. However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu called this a "reward for terrorism" while the US disagreed with the recognition, stating that any Palestinian State should come from direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
