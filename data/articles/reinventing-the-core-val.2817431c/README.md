Companies are moving beyond traditional core value statements to embrace more resonant and distinctive expressions of their ethos. This shift reflects a desire for authenticity and alignment with strategic objectives, as seen in the adoption of alternative formats...more

During the 1990s, a new trend swept the business world: Large companies began publicly articulating their moral convictions in what became known as core value statements.

The trend was heavily inspired by Japanese companies. Firms such as Toyota and Sony had become known for the high quality of their manufactured products, which was attributed to their organizational cultures of solidarity. To replicate this success, Western firms were advised to institute their own core values, oftentimes around such watchwords as ‚Äúteamwork‚Äù and ‚Äúexcellence.‚Äù

In the ensuing years, statements of core values would evolve in their purpose and content. With the rise of branding at the corporate level, for example, many began to showcase dynamic ideas such as ‚Äújoy‚Äù and ‚Äúobsession.‚Äù Similarly, after the scandals of the early 2000s at companies such as Enron and WorldCom, many came to emphasize ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù and ‚Äúdoing the right thing.‚Äù

More recently, however, the statement of core values, itself, has begun to fracture into different formats. Companies are using different or more specific names to describe them, targeting them at specific groups of stakeholders, and breaking away from the expectation that the statement will consist of an itemized list.

Indeed, today more than one-third of Fortune 100 companies have an alternative to a core value statement. Some have a credo, a way, a manifesto, or even a trademarked set of Principles or Beliefs, as with Pepsi‚Äôs ‚ÄúPep+‚ÄùTM or CVS Health‚Äôs ‚ÄúOur Heart At Work Behaviors.‚ÄùTM

We believe this trend should be welcomed. Companies that can express their values more freely have more ways to address the typical problems: Their values are divorced from strategy, stakeholders do not know them, workers do not practice them, and everyone views them as little more than window dressing for the website.

In this article, we explain why things are changing and how to tap the new potential these newer alternatives to core value statements can offer.

Why Things Are Changing

We believe companies are seeking new alternatives for three reasons.

Companies want something more resonant.

Statements of core values are often a mishmash of team, performance, culture, brand, and compliance-values. With something for all stakeholders, they do not particularly resonate with any of them, and therefore are often tuned out all around as background noise.

To reduce that risk, many companies are no longer trying to cover all their moral bases or speak to all their stakeholders at once, but to hit home with a key constituency.

Amazon is a good example. It does not have core values, per se, but ‚Äúleadership principles.‚Äù These are targeted to company managers and their unique roles, whether supervising (‚ÄúInsist on the highest standards‚Äù) or recruiting (‚ÄúHire and develop the best‚Äù). A leader-focused statement makes sense for Amazon, since the company depends on an army of empowered leaders, working in hundreds of fulfillment centers, to resolve hard logistical problems on the fly under same-day deadlines.

Companies want something more distinctive.

There has long been a tension in values statements between the universal and the unique. On the one hand, these statements tend to affirm some of the most fundamental precepts (‚Äúhonesty,‚Äù ‚Äúrespect‚Äù) and some of the most ascendant cultural narratives (‚Äúhuman rights,‚Äù ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù). On the other hand, they are expected to showcase the company‚Äôs own identity and special way of doing things.

Increasingly, this tension is resolving in the direction of uniqueness as core values statements, more and more, are becoming tools of corporate branding. This change is apparent on corporate websites. Here, even where the statements are reducible to a list, each item is really a discussion piece ‚Äî part of a storyboard of videos and professional copy that serves, overall, to bring the company to life as a singular, authentic being.

Apple is a good example. Each of its ‚Äúshared values,‚Äù from greenness to personalization and employee wellbeing, is a banner on its website that comes underneath an employee portrait. Clicking on ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù leads to a story from Jessica, a team leader in Australia, about growing up with a disabled grandfather. Similarly, ‚Äúvolunteering‚Äù leads to a story from Nafisah, a sales advisor in Ireland, about the greeting cards that she hand-wrote for refugees. In the end, by weaving its moral fibers into stories, Apple has built a larger narrative about its own identity as a company that uniquely and truly cares.

Companies want something fuller.

Beyond a list of values, many companies are building a value system or even a larger philosophy about the right way of doing business. Embedding their values in their identity, history, beliefs, culture, and worldview, these companies infuse them with more meaning, while giving fuller guidance to workers for implementation.

Google, for example, has based its values on a set of fundamental beliefs. A few years after its founding, the company published ‚ÄúTen Things We Know to Be True.‚Äù Rather than moral aspirations, these were statements about what is correct or perfectly acceptable in business. Propositions that ‚ÄúYou can be serious without a suit‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be at your desk to get an answer‚Äù served to challenge the stuffy, hierarchical business culture of prior generations, and laid the foundation for the reputation that Google would gain over the next decade as an open, flexible, and playful company.

How to Create Your Own Alternative to a Core Value Statement

In light of these changes, how should you create a new kind of value statement that is especially good for your own company? Our advice: Consider the goals that a values statement can advance, pick the most significant one for your business, and match the statement format to the desired objective.

Starting with a goal will ensure that your statement is strategic. Your statement is an opportunity to get your stakeholders informed about and organized around a key business objective. The statement can increase motivation toward that objective by drawing out the higher meanings, timeless truths, or unshakable convictions that are involved. This capacity of a statement to support business strategy is missed by companies who treat their statement as a completion exercise, where the task is only to capture a few positive points about the existing company culture.

Below, to demonstrate how the values statement can serve a business objective, we offer some pairings of company goals and statement formats. The pairs illustrate how these statements are becoming fuller, more distinctive, and more resonant. Although our examples are far from complete, they cover a range of possibilities for making your values statement a load-bearing component of your business strategy.

Galvanizing a brand identity.

A statement of values can make a statement. In presenting ‚ÄúWho We Are,‚Äù it can shout ‚ÄúHere We Are!‚Äù In other words, it can proclaim in a single document where you come from, what you stand for, and how you operate. To signal that your statement is a bold introduction of yourself to the world, particularly good formats are the declaration or manifesto (Nike), ‚Äúour story‚Äù (Tom‚Äôs), or, for new ventures, the ‚Äúfounders letter‚Äù (to this day, Google‚Äôs still appears on its website).

Gluing together a production process.

Managing a complex chain of research, design, sourcing, and manufacturing is how many companies produce the latest technological marvel. A key to their success, oftentimes, is the spirit of professionalism, system thinking, and continuous improvement that they have infused throughout the enterprise. To use your statement to inculcate an operational ethos, especially good formats are ‚Äúour philosophy‚Äù (Toshiba), ‚Äúour culture‚Äù (Merck), or ‚Äúour way‚Äù (Toyota).

Winning over a customer.

Many customers draw back from purchases because of concerns about product safety and performance, how you will use their data, and whether you will provide service after the sale. Because your statement is official and explicit, it can be an especially powerful tool for assuring customers that your own highest priorities are exactly the things that worry them the most. In this case, good formats for making your statement a part of your selling pitch are ‚Äúour pledge‚Äù (Kohl‚Äôs), ‚Äúour promise‚Äù (Southwest Airlines), ‚Äúour commitment‚Äù (Gillette), and ‚Äúour credo‚Äù (Johnson & Johnson).

Showcasing a business edge.

Companies must develop a set of competitive advantages that their peers cannot easily imitate. Speedy delivery, lifelong quality, or bottom-basement prices are examples. Showcasing a competitive advantage in the values statement can promote external awareness and remind workers to keep their eyes on the ball. If the competitive advantage is a single thing, formats that work well for communicating it in a memorable way are the slogan, motto, maxim, or mantra (e.g., Iandco or¬†Reliance Industries).

Fostering a healthy workplace.

Some statements promote a set of concrete behaviors for the office. A conduct-based statement may be recommended where workers have to grapple with unavoidable stress factors (e.g., tight deadlines, entry-level pay, close quarters, long hours) and where any lapses in behavior may be particularly damaging to the company (e.g., by leading to negative online reviews). Statement formats that are particularly good for guiding worker conduct are ‚Äúour behaviors‚Äù (CVS) and ‚Äúour expectations‚Äù (Jefferson Lab).

More than 30 years after it swept into the business world, the core value statement is still an expectation for companies, even as it has become a catchall for many formats that companies are using to express the things that matter most to them, in ways that are increasingly stylish, distinctive, and promotional of the corporate brand. Companies would be wise to use this new freedom to interest their stakeholders with more creativity and to further their own company objectives.
