Frances Bulathsinghala argues in an opinion piece that the peace of a nation does not lie in the hands of the United Nations or any other international body. Rather, long-term stability and sustainability can only be achieved by revitalising the entire nation in every sphere, from education to recreation, devoid of false pride or anger. She draws attention to Japan, which rejuvenated its country after World War II and has since developed a peaceful and holistic national mindset. She underlines that the start of unrest in society takes place when any community or communities feel lesser than others due to their ethnicity, caste, religion, or language. Towards the end, she suggests that Sri Lanka should end serving peace and stability on the plate of other nations and devise a genuine plan to ensure hatred, despair, and petty superiority don't cause it to self-destruct.
