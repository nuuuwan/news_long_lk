Frances Bulathsinghala, a journalist for Sri Lankan newspaper The Sunday Times, advocates for peace and unity. She argues that the peace of a nation does not lie with international bodies such as the UN, but with the people of the nation themselves. Using the example of Japan, Bulathsinghala recommends revitalising the entire nation in every sphere, from education to recreation, to develop a mindset focused on peace. Reflecting on her experiences in Sri Lanka, she contends that those immersed in violence value peace the most. She emphasises the importance of unity and reconciliation, and urges for the implementation of people-centric policies to ensure long-term stability. Adopting wisdom in policy making and focusing on local needs, Bulathsinghala suggests, can help a nation avoid divisions based on ethnicity, religion, caste, or language.
