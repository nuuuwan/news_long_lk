The outcome of the November 2024 US presidential election will greatly impact Europe, given the US is the EU’s most significant trade and investment partner, and European NATO members are reliant on US security guarantees. If Donald Trump wins, there will be a push for European NATO members to increase their spending and become more autonomous in defense. Under his presidency, there might also be a greater reduction in military and financial support for Ukraine to get them to negotiate an end to the war. Moreover, his threat to impose a 10% tariff on all of the US’s trading partners could prove shockingly detrimental to the EU economy. Trump also plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and invest in fossil fuels, which would have significant implications for the EU’s climate change goals. On the other hand, Biden would likely cooperate with allies and work hard to mitigate climate change. His stance on China, however, would put significant pressure on Europe to align with the US.
