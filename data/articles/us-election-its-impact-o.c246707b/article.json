    "US election: its impact on Europe",
    "ElectionsForecastingPoliticsUS electionAmericasEuropeGlobalUnited StatesCountry Analysis",
    "The November\u00a02024 US presidential election will be extremely close. Our forecast is a win for the Democratic incumbent, Joe\u00a0Biden, but a victory for his Republican predecessor, Donald\u00a0Trump, cannot be discounted.",
    "The US is the EU\u2019s largest trade and investment partner, and European NATO members are reliant on US security guarantees, so the future of US trade and defence policy will be highly consequential for Europe.",
    "We expect a hawkish approach to China regardless of who wins the election, putting pressure on the EU to align. On green policy, Mr\u00a0Trump would row back on global goals, but with some upside risks for European firms.",
    "The outlook for US security guarantees should Mr\u00a0Trump retake the presidency is the issue causing the most consternation in Europe in the run-up to the US election. Mr Trump is often unpredictable, but his criticism of countries that do not meet NATO\u2019s target of defence spending amounting to 2% of GDP has been consistent. In recent comments he has taken his long-standing characterisation of these countries as \u201cfreeloaders\u201d to another level by suggesting that the US might not come to their aid in the event of a Russian invasion, as NATO\u2019s Article 5 requires. This has prompted much concern: in 2023, 20 of the 31\u00a0NATO members failed to meet the 2% spending target (although the countries bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine all did, bar Norway). Mr\u00a0Trump has even floated the idea of the US withdrawing from NATO; however, this is highly unlikely, as it would need congressional approval.",
    "What we consider more likely from a Trump presidency is a spate of decisions aimed at putting severe pressure on European NATO members to step up their spending\u00a0and become more autonomous in defence. This could include withdrawing from joint exercises, reducing the number of US troops on the ground, cutting relevant spending and continuing to sow doubts about the US\u2019s commitment to Article 5 of the alliance. In response, we would expect a more serious push in the EU towards boosting defence capabilities, including greater co-operation with the UK (where the defence spending target has recently been\u00a0raised to 2.5% of GDP). Still, there are limitations to what could be achieved in the short to medium term given the degree of fragmentation in the current EU system, as well as bureaucratic and industrial bottlenecks.\u00a0US military contractors stand to benefit most.",
    "Ukraine\u2019s future in the balance",
    "The most consequential security policy shift that we could expect from a Trump presidency concerns the level of US support for Ukraine.\u00a0Under a Biden administration we would expect aid to be eroded to a level sufficient to stabilise the front lines, but not enough for Ukraine to regain the land currently occupied by Russia (about one-fifth of the country). Under Mr Trump uncertainty is high, but we would expect\u00a0a sharper reduction in military and financial support\u00a0in order to force Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war quickly. The risk, depending on how this is handled, is that it could damage the credibility of the Western countries that had promised to back Ukraine, undermine Western security guarantees more generally and potentially embolden expansionist powers. Fear of Russian revisionism in the Baltic states and Moldova would spike in this scenario. NATO is already considering a plan to lock in \u20ac100bn of spending for Ukraine over five years.",
    "A potential shock to US-EU trade",
    "On trade policy, we would expect Mr\u00a0Biden, for the most part, to co-operate with allies and compete with rivals. Mr\u00a0Trump, in contrast, would probably prefer to compete with everyone, while also being less predictable and more antagonistic than Mr\u00a0Biden. This is significant because the two economies are highly integrated: the US is the EU\u2019s largest trade partner (buying a fifth of EU exports in 2023) and its largest investment destination. The US also ran trade deficits\u2014which Mr Trump abhors\u2014with 20 of the 27\u00a0EU member states last year. In this context, Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s threat to impose a blanket 10% tariff on all of the US\u2019s trading partners represents a major potential shock to the EU economy. Of course, such a course of action would face both legal and congressional hurdles, so its feasibility remains far from clear\u2014and even if implemented, the EU might be able to secure exemptions. In the worst-case scenario, if tariffs were imposed and the EU retaliated with tariffs on US goods, this would be highly inflationary, damaging growth in both economies.",
    "We see three specific issues to watch on the US-EU trade policy front:",
    "US tariffs on EU steel (at 25%) and aluminium (at 10%)\u00a0are currently suspended until 2025. Mr\u00a0Biden would probably keep these suspended as leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Mr\u00a0Trump would probably reimpose them immediately. This would exacerbate the EU\u2019s decline in global market share for such energy-intensive goods, after an initial hit when European gas prices spiked in 2022.",
    "US tariffs on automotive imports\u00a0were a threat during Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s first presidency, and, although they were not imposed by the necessary deadline in 2019, could make a reappearance should he win a second term. EU carmakers would be vulnerable.",
    "Plans for digital services taxes (DSTs)\u00a0are currently on hold during negotiations on the\u00a0OECD\u2019s global tax deal. We expect that Mr\u00a0Biden would keep the US involved in this, even though he might not finally endorse the treaty. In contrast, Mr\u00a0Trump would probably exit the agreement\u2014prompting the suspended DSTs to be imposed. These would be most damaging for US tech firms, and could prompt a tit-for-tat trade war.",
    "Industrial policy: green subsidies and China de-risking",
    "On climate policy, a win for Mr\u00a0Trump would mean a significant shift in the US stance.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Biden and Mr\u00a0Trump have opposing views on climate change, with Mr\u00a0Biden prioritising investment in green technologies and renewable energy in the almost US$400bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while Mr\u00a0Trump has promised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the international climate change treaty, and invest in fossil fuels. There would be upside risks for investment in Europe from Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s plans to slow down IRA subsidies for investments in renewable energies, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), as these have been drawing investment away from European firms. However, the bigger picture is that for the EU,\u00a0losing the US as an ally in the fight against climate change would be a severe hit, as this would be likely to jeopardise global efforts to avoid a tipping point in temperatures. It could also embolden those in the EU pushing for short-term economic interests to be prioritised over the green transition.",
    "On China, both candidates agree (roughly speaking) on a hawkish position, with Mr Biden announcing\u00a0100% tariffs on Chinese EVs\u00a0in May. Under either president, European countries will come under pressure to clarify and harden\u00a0their positions on China, with the current disunity (Germany versus France, and Hungary versus the rest of the EU) creating friction in the US-EU relationship. The shape of this would vary, though, with Mr\u00a0Biden pushing for a multilateral position (painful for Europe given its greater economic exposure to China), and Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s unilateral decision-making presenting unpredictable risks (such as Chinese goods flooding into the EU as a result of new tariffs on exports to the US). In particular, Mr Trump\u2019s threat to revoke China\u2019s \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d status and raise tariffs on all Chinese goods by up to 60% would have major repercussions for Europe.",
    "We see two specific issues to watch on the industrial policy front:",
    "The EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\u00a0is now being phased in, with duties to be levied from 2026. For Mr\u00a0Trump, this would be an automatic\u00a0point of contention with the EU\u2014even though the US will not be much disadvantaged by this, as its production of the goods affected is not highly carbon-intensive. It might even benefit, with its exports being taxed less than emerging market equivalents.",
    "Co-operation on diversifying suppliers of critical minerals\u00a0would continue under Mr\u00a0Biden, probably through the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC), where this has already begun. Under Mr Trump the\u00a0TTC would probably not survive. However, shared US and EU progress on\u00a0de-risking critical mineral supply chains\u00a0away from China could potentially be achieved on a transactional rather than a co-operative basis.",
