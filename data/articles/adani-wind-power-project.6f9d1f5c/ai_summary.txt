Facts:
- Adani has created controversy in Sri Lanka over its proposed wind power project due to its negotiation of a price of 8.26 USCts/kWh, which is significantly higher than the estimated fair price of 5.58 USCts/kWh based on available public data and standard industry practices.
- Unlike standard processes which require competitive bids, Adani was not taken through a transparent bidding process and was the only one given the opportunity to submit a proposal for the wind power plant, ostensibly because it was supposed to be a project promoted by the government of India.
- However, the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, clarified that it was a commercial project promoted by Adani, not by the Indian government.
- The proposal involves two wind power plants, one in Mannar and another in Pooneryn. The deal would lead to Sri Lanka paying about $1,200 million extra over the next 20 years.
- Despite legal challenges, previous administrations made several attempts to bypass formal bidding procedures for similar projects, often leading to legal challenges and failed projects.

Opinions:
- The author criticizes the procurement process, arguing that it is not competitive, open, or transparent, and deems it an attempt to legitimize a backdoor entry.
- The Article voices concerns about the price negotiation, maintaining that Adani's price is not comparable to the costs of other types of power plants in Sri Lanka.
- The author implicitly criticizes the politicians and administrators involved in the deal for their alleged mediocrity and inability to properly assess the project.
- The article implies that Adani might be intentionally exaggerating costs or underestimating wind speeds and efficiencies to justify their higher pricing, while asking for more transparency and explanation.
- The author questions if Adani's expected profits are more than the industry standard in Sri Lanka and asks if there's a possibility of the wind turbines degrading faster than expected.
