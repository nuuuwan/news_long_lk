    "MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0How To\u00a0series helps you get things done.\u00a0 Today, OpenAI released its video generation model Sora to the public. The announcement comes on the fifth day of the company\u2019s \u201cshipmas\u201d event, a 12-day marathon of tech releases and demos. Here\u2019s what you should know\u2014and how you can use the video model right now.  What is Sora? Sora is a powerful AI video generation model that can create videos from text prompts, animate images, or remix videos in new styles. OpenAI first previewed the model back in February, but today is the first time the company is releasing it for broader use.\u00a0 What\u2019s new about this release? The core function of Sora\u2014creating impressive videos with simple prompts\u2014remains similar to what was previewed in February, but OpenAI worked to make the model faster and cheaper ahead of this wider release. There are a few new features, and two stand out.",
    "One is called Storyboard. With it, you can create multiple AI-generated videos and then assemble them together on a timeline, much the way you would with conventional video editors like Adobe Premiere Pro.\u00a0 The second is a feed that functions as a sort of creative gallery. Users can post their Sora-generated videos to the feed, see the prompts behind certain videos, tweak them, and generally get inspiration, OpenAI says.",
    "How much can you do with it? You can generate videos from text prompts, change the style of videos and change elements with a tool called Remix, and assemble multiple clips together with Storyboard. Sora also provides preset styles you can apply to your videos, like moody film noir or cardboard and papercraft, which gives a stop-motion feel. You can also trim and loop the videos that you make.\u00a0 Who can use it? To generate videos with Sora, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI\u2019s premium plans\u2014either ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) or ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month). Both subscriptions include access to other OpenAI products as well. Users with ChatGPT Plus can generate videos as long as five seconds with a resolution up to 720p. This plan lets you create 50 videos per month.\u00a0 Users with a ChatGPT Pro subscription can generate longer, higher-resolution videos, capped at a resolution of 1080p and a duration of 20 seconds. They can also have Sora generate up to five variations of a video at once from a single prompt, making it possible to review options faster. Pro users are limited to 500 videos per month but can also create unlimited \u201crelaxed\u201d videos, which are not generated in the moment but rather queued for when site traffic is low.\u00a0 Both subscription levels make it possible to create videos in three aspect ratios: vertical, horizontal, and square.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have a subscription, you\u2019ll be limited to viewing the feed of Sora-generated videos.\u00a0 OpenAI is starting its global launch of Sora today, but it will take longer to launch in \u201cmost of Europe,\u201d the company said.\u00a0 OPENAI  Where can I access it? OpenAI has broken Sora out from ChatGPT. To access it, go to Sora.com and log in with your ChatGPT Plus or Pro account. (MIT Technology Review was unable to access the site at press time\u2014a note on the site indicated that signups were paused because they were \u201ccurrently experiencing heavy traffic.\u201d)\u00a0 How\u2019d we get here? A number of things have happened since OpenAI first unveiled Sora back in February. Other tech companies have also launched video generation tools, like Meta Movie Gen and Google Veo. There\u2019s also been plenty of backlash. For example, artists who had early access to experiment with Sora leaked the tool to protest the way OpenAI has trained it on artists\u2019 work without compensation.\u00a0 What\u2019s next? As with any new release of a model, it remains to be seen what steps OpenAI has taken to keep Sora from being used for nefarious, illegal, or unethical purposes, like the creation of deepfakes. On the question of moderation and safety, an OpenAI employee said they \u201cmight not get it perfect on day one.\u201d  Another looming question is how much computing capacity and energy Sora will use up every time it creates a video. Generating a video uses much more computing time, and therefore energy, than generating a typical text response in a tool like ChatGPT.\u00a0 The AI boom has already been an energy hog, presenting a challenge to tech companies aiming to rein in their emissions, and the wide availability of Sora and other video models like it has the potential to make that problem worse. hide"
