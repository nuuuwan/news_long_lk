The article discusses the collapse of a concrete beam on Sri Lanka's Central Expressway, specifically part of the highway project from Kadawatha to Mirigama. This incident, occurring during the construction of a 36.59 km stretch, raises concerns about the project's quality and safety. The collapse of the beam, originally installed in 2021, caused additional two beams to tilt, resulting in significant financial loss. The collapse was attributed to the deterioration of a rubber pad used in its installation due to weather exposure. The project, managed by Metalogical Corporation China (MCC) but overseen by the Road Development Authority (RDA), has faced delays and quality concerns. There is an ongoing debate about who should bear the financial responsibilityâ€”the construction company (MCC), the RDA, or the Government of Sri Lanka. This situation echoes past issues with other Chinese imports and raises questions about proper inspection and quality control. The incident is still under investigation, and inspections are being conducted on other beams along the 6 km stretch.
