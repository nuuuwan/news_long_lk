    "Paleontologists aren\u2019t easily deterred by evolutionary dead ends or a sparse fossil record. But in the last few years, they\u2019ve developed a new trick for turning back time and studying prehistoric animals: building experimental robotic models of them. In the absence of a living specimen, scientists say, an ambling, flying, swimming, or slithering automaton is the next best thing for studying the behavior of extinct organisms. Learning more about how they moved can in turn shed light on aspects of their lives, such as their historic ranges and feeding habits.\u00a0 Digital models already do a decent job of predicting animal biomechanics, but modeling complex environments like uneven surfaces, loose terrain, and turbulent water is challenging. With a robot, scientists can simply sit back and watch its behavior in different environments. \u201cWe can look at its performance without having to think of every detail, [as] in the simulation,\u201d says John Nyakatura, an evolutionary biologist at Humboldt University in Berlin.\u00a0 Related StoryFast-learning robots: 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2025AI advances are rapidly speeding up the process of training robots, and helping them do new tasks almost instantly.",
    "The union of paleontology and robots has its roots in the more established field of bio-inspired robotics, in which scientists fashion robots based on modern animals. Paleo-roboticists, however, face the added complication of designing robotic systems for which there is no living reference. They work around this limitation by abstracting from the next best option, such as a modern descendant or an incomplete fossil record. To help make sure they\u2019re on the right track, they might try to derive general features from modern fauna that radiated from a common ancestor on the evolutionary tree. Or they might turn to good ol\u2019 physics to home in on the most plausible ways an animal moved. Biology might have changed over millions of years; the fundamental laws of nature, not so much.\u00a0 Modern technological advances are pulling paleo-inspired robotics into a golden age. Computer-aided design and leading-\u00adedge fabrication techniques such as 3D printing allow researchers to rapidly churn out prototypes. New materials expand the avenues for motion control in an automaton. And improved 3D imaging technology has enabled researchers to digitize fossils with unprecedented detail.",
    "All this helps paleo-roboticists spin up more realistic robots\u2014ones that can better attain the fluid motion associated with living, breathing animals, as opposed to the stilted movements seen in older generations of robots. Now, researchers are moving closer to studying the kinds of behavioral questions that can be investigated only by bringing extinct animals back to life\u2014or something like it. \u201cWe really think that this is such an underexplored area for robotics to really contribute to science,\u201d says Michael Ishida, a roboticist at Cambridge University in the UK who penned\u00a0a review study\u00a0on the field.\u00a0 Here are four examples of robots that are shedding light on creatures of yore.  The OroBot In the late 2010s, John Nyakatura was working to study the gait of an extinct creature called Orobates pabsti. The four-limbed animal, which prowled Earth 280 million years ago, is largely a mystery\u2014it dates to a time before mammals and reptiles developed and was in fact related to the last common ancestor of the two groups. A breakthrough came when Nyakatura met a roboticist who had built an automaton that was inspired by a modern tetrapod\u2014a salamander. The relationship started the way many serendipitous collaborations do: \u201cWe just talked over beer,\u201d Nyakatura says. The team adapted the existing robot blueprint, with the paleontologists feeding the anatomical specs of the fossil to the roboticists to build on. The researchers christened their brainchild OroBot.\u00a0  Fossilized footprints, and features like step length and foot rotation, offer clues to how tetrapods walked.SEBASTIAN VOIGT/URWELTMUSEUM GEOSKOP THALLICHTENBERG   A fossilized skeleton of Orobates pabsti, a four-limbed creature that lived some 280 million years ago.THOMAS MARTENS/MUSEUM DER NATUR GOTHA     OroBot\u2019s proportions are informed by CT scans of fossils. The researchers used off-the-shelf parts to assemble the automaton. The large sizes of standard actuators, devices that convert energy into motion, meant they had to scale up OroBot to about one and a half yards (1.4 meters) in length, twice the size of the original. They also equipped the bot with flexible pads for tread instead of anatomically accurate feet. Feet are complex bodily structures that are a nightmare to replicate: They have a wide range of motion and lots of connective soft tissue.",
    "A top view of OroBot executing a waddle.ALESSANDRO CRESPI/EPFL LAUSANNE   Thanks to the team\u2019s creative shortcut, OroBot looks as if it\u2019s tromping in flip-flops. But the robot\u2019s designers took pains to get other details just so, including its 3D-printed faux bones, which were painted a ruddy color and given an osseous texture to more closely mimic the original fossil. It was a scientifically unnecessary design choice, but a labor of love. \u201cYou can tell that the engineers really liked this robot,\u201d Nyakatura said. \u201cThey really fell in love with it.\u201d Once OroBot was complete, Nyakatura\u2019s team put it on a treadmill to see how it walked. After measuring the robot\u2019s energy consumption, its stability in motion, and the similarity of its tracks to fossilized footprints, the researchers concluded that Orobates probably sashayed like a modern caiman, the significantly punier cousin of the crocodile. \u201cWe think we found evidence for this more advanced terrestrial locomotion, some 50 million years earlier than previously expected,\u201d Nyakatura says. \u201cThis changes our concept of how early tetrapod evolution took place.\u201d Robotic ammonites Ammonites were shell-toting cephalopods\u2014the animal class that encompasses modern squids and octopuses\u2014that lived during the age of the dinosaurs. The only surviving ammonite lineage today is the nautilus. Fossils of ammonites, though, are abundant, which means there are plenty of good references for researchers interested in studying their shells\u2014and building robotic models.\u00a0  An illustration of an ammonite shell cut in half.PETERMAN, D.J., RITTERBUSH, K.A., CIAMPAGLIO, C.N., JOHNSON, E.H., INOUE, S., MIKAMI, T., AND LINN, T.J. 2021. \u201cBUOYANCY CONTROL IN AMMONOID CEPHALOPODS REFINED BY COMPLEX INTERNAL SHELL ARCHITECTURE.\u201d SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 11:90   When David Peterman, an evolutionary biomechanist, was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah from 2020 to 2022, he wanted to study how the structures of different ammonite shells influenced the underwater movement of their owners. More simply put, he wanted to confirm \u201cwhether or not [the ammonites] were capable of swimming,\u201d he says. From the fossils alone, it\u2019s not apparent how these ammonites fared in aquatic environments\u2014whether they wobbled out of control, moved sluggishly, or zipped around with ease. Peterman needed to build a robot to find out.\u00a0  A peek at the internal arrangement of the ammonite robots, which span about half a foot in diameter.PETERMAN, D.J., AND RITTERBUSH, K.A. 2022. \u201cRESURRECTING EXTINCT CEPHALOPODS WITH BIOMIMETIC ROBOTS TO EXPLORE HYDRODYNAMIC STABILITY, MANEUVERABILITY, AND PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS ON LIFE HABITS.\u201d SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 12: 11287   It\u2019s straightforward to copy the shell size and shape from the fossils, but the real test comes when the robot hits the water. Mass distribution is everything; an unbalanced creature will flop and bob around. To avoid that problem, Peterman added internal counterweights to compensate for a battery here or the jet thruster there. At the same time, he had to account for the total mass to achieve neutral buoyancy, so that in the water the robot neither floated nor sank.\u00a0  A 3D-printed ammonite robot gets ready to hit the water for a drag race. \u201cWe were getting paid to go play with robots and swim in the middle of a work day,\u201d Peterman says. \u201cIt was a lot of fun.\u201dDAVID PETERMAN   Then came the fun part\u2014robots of different shell sizes ran drag races in the university\u2019s Olympic-sized swimming pool, drawing the curiosity of other gym-goers. What Peterman found was that the shells had to strike a tricky balance of stability and maneuverability. There was no one best structure, the team concluded. Narrower shells were stabler and could slice through the water while staying upright. Conches that were wider were nimbler, but ammonites would need more energy to maintain their verticality. The shell an ancient ammonite adopted was the one that suited or eventually shaped its particular lifestyle and swimming form.\u00a0  This bichir-inspired robot looks nothing like a bichir, with only a segmented frame (in black) that allows it to writhe and flap like the fish. The researchers gradually tweak the robot\u2019s features, on the hunt for the minimum physiology an ancient fish would need in order to walk on land for the first time.MICHAEL ISHIDA, FIDJI BERIO, VALENTINA DI SANTO, NEIL H. SHUBIN AND FUMIYA IIDA   Robofish What if roboticists have no fossil reference? This was the conundrum faced by Michael Ishida\u2019s team, who wanted to better understand how ancient marine animals first moved from sea to land nearly 400 million years ago and learned to walk.\u00a0 Lacking transitional fossils, the researchers looked to modern ambulatory fishes. A whole variety of gaits are on display among these scaly strollers\u2014the four-finned crawl of the epaulette shark, the terrestrial butterfly stroke of a mudskipper. Like the converging roads in Rome, multiple ancient fishes had independently arrived at different ways of walking. Ishida\u2019s group decided to focus on one particular gait: the half step, half slither of the bichir Polypterus senegalus.",
    "Admittedly, the team\u2019s \u201crobofish\u201d looks nothing like the still-extant bichir. The body consists of rigid segments instead of a soft, flexible polymer. It\u2019s a drastically watered-down version, because the team is hunting for the minimum set of features and movements that might allow a fishlike creature to push forward with its appendages. \u201c\u2018Minimum\u2019 is a tricky word,\u201d Ishida says. But robotic experiments can help rule out the physically implausible: \u201cWe can at least have some evidence to say, yes, with this particular bone structure, or with this particular joint morphology, [a fish] was probably able to walk on land.\u201d Starting with the build of a modern fish, the team simplified the robot further and further until it could no longer sally forth. It was the equivalent of working backwards in the evolutionary timeline.\u00a0 Related StoryWhat\u2019s next for robotsWith tests of humanoid bots and new developments in military applications, the year ahead will intrigue even the skeptics.",
    "The team hopes to publish its results in a journal sometime soon. Even in the rush to finalize the manuscript, Ishida still recognizes how fortunate he is to be doing something that\u2019s simultaneously futuristic and prehistoric. \u201cIt\u2019s every kid\u2019s dream to build robots and to study dinosaurs,\u201d he says. Every day, he gets to do both.\u00a0 The Rhombot Nearly 450 million years ago, an echinoderm with the build of an oversize sperm lumbered across the seafloor. The lineage of that creature, the pleurocystitid, has long since been snuffed out, but evidence of its existence lies frozen among numerous fossils. How it moved, though, is anyone\u2019s guess, for no modern-\u00adday animal resembles this bulbous critter.\u00a0  A fossil of a pleurocystitid, an extinct aquatic animal that lived some 450 million years ago.CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY   Carmel Majidi, a mechanical engineer at Carnegie Mellon University, was already building robots in the likeness of starfish and other modern-day echinoderms. Then his team decided to apply the same skills to study their pleurocystitid predecessor to untangle the mystery of its movement.  CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY   Majidi\u2019s team borrowed a trick from previous efforts to build soft robots. \u201cThe main challenge for us was to incorporate actuation in the organism,\u201d he says. The stem, or tail, needed to be pliable yet go rigid on command, like actual muscle. Embedding premade motors, which are usually made of stiff material, in the tail wouldn\u2019t work. In the end, Majidi\u2019s team fashioned the appendage out of shape-memory alloy, a kind of metal that deforms or keeps its shape, depending on the temperature. By delivering localized heating along the tail through electrical stimulation, the scientists could get it to bend and flick.\u00a0  The researchers tested the effects of different stems, or tails, on their robot\u2019s overall movement.CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY   Both Majidi\u2019s resulting Rhombot and computer simulations, published in 2023, showed that pleurocystitids likely beat their tails from side to side in a sweeping fashion to propel themselves forward, and their speeds depended on the tail stiffness and body angle. The team found that having a longer stem\u2014up to two-thirds of a foot long\u2014was advantageous, adding speed without incurring higher energy costs. Indeed, the fossil record confirms this evolutionary trend. In the future, the researchers plan to test out Rhombot on even more surface textures, such as muddy terrain. \u00a0 Shi En Kim is a freelance science writer based in Washington, DC. hide"
