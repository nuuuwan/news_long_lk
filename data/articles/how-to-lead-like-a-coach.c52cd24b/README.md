The modern workplace demands that executives move away from a command-and-control style and instead adopt a model based on the idea of the leader as a coach. Companies have devoted extensive resources to this effort, in the form of time-intensive training programs and expensive new technologies, but without great success. In this article, the authors draw on their experiences as behavioral scientists and propose a simpler, cheaper, and more-effective approach: Help leaders identify interactions that they’re already having with their employees and work to transform them into coaching moments.

The modern workplace demands a shift in leadership style. We hear it on repeat: The command-and-control model is a thing of the past.
