Veteran actor B Saroja Devi, known for her work in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu cinema, breathed her last at the age of 87 on Monday (July 14) in Bengaluru.. The actor was reportedly suffering from age-related illness.

An actor who starred in many memorable films alongside veteran southern Indian superstars such as MG Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan, and NT Rama Rao, Saroja Devi also shared screen space with Hindi stars such as Dilip Kumar (Paigham, 1959), Rajendra Kumar (Sasural, 1961) and Sunil Dutt (Beti Bete, 1964). The news about her death has sent shockwaves across Indian cinema, drawing reactions from members of the film fraternity and fans.

Paying tribute to the late actor, superstar Rajinikanth wrote on his X handle, “The great actress Saroja Devi, who won the hearts of millions of fans, is no longer with us. May her soul rest in peace.”

Kannada star Kichcha Sudeep, in his heartfelt tribute, called her a ‘Goddess of Acting’ who “like a parijata flower, she has lived a full life with her fragrance and has now departed from us.”

Sadhu Kokila, popular music composer, comedian and president of Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, in his tribute to Saroja Devi, said that this is an irreparable loss, “not only to Kannada but to the entire Indian film industry.”

Tamil actor-politician Khushbu Sundar wrote on X, “#SarojaDevi amma was the greatest of all times. No other female actor in south has ever enjoyed the name and fame as her. Such a lovable adorable soul she was. Had a great rapport with her. My trip to Bengaluru was incomplete without meeting her. And whenever in chennai, she would call. Will miss her immensely. (sic)“

Actor Prabhudheva said Saroja’s grace and legacy will remain eternal.

Tamil actor Simran, meanwhile, said that “the legacy of Saroja Devi in Indian cinema will remain eternal,” adding that she feels blessed to have shared the screen with the actor in 1997’s Once More, which also featured Sivaji Ganesan.

Gautami Tadimalla called Saroja an icon who was emulated by generations of aspiring actresses for her grace, glamour, performance and charm.”Her poise, beauty and sparkling personality enthralled audiences and she has built a legacy that will endure for ages to come. I bow to her incredible achievements as a pioneering actress and mourn her passing with a heavy heart,” wrote Gautami.

“Having acted alongside all leading heroes and starred as the heroine in over 200 films, she guided generations of women through her art, discipline, and dedication,” wrote actor Karthi in his tribute.
