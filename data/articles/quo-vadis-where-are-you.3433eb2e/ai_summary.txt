Sri Lanka's current economic woes can be attributed to its adoption of Western advice on development, says a Sunday Observer commentary. Writer Amal Jayawardane argues that the country did not pay enough attention to how Asian countries developed their own economies and instead adhered to Western models, such as the "Washington Consensus". As a result, Sri Lanka's economy became over-reliant on foreign borrowing and prioritised individual interests over societal needs. Jayawardane asserts that it is time for a radically new economic mindset that acknowledges the potential of monetary policy for development, and moves beyond the constraints of neoliberal thinking.
