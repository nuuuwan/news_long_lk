Workday, a business and financial management software company, is implementing a holistic approach to diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI). DEI is viewed as central to the company's operations, influencing everything from recruitment to talent development and customer relationships. Workday operates under the VIBE (Value, Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity for all) philosophy. In a company webinar, Daniela Porr and Mary Roemmele from Workday discussed the firm's DEI strategy, highlighting the importance of making products accessible to all and revealed that while the organizational commitment to DEI is strong, the strategy needed to implement it is lacking.
