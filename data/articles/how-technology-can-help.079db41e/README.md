Complimentary Sponsor Content Webinar and Report

Business leaders continue to prioritize talent. Organizationsâ€™ commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is key to attracting talent and customers. Workday takes a holistic approach to DEI, both internally and externally. DEI is not siloed at Workday, but is central to the company and are embedded throughoutâ€”in recruiting, talent development, employee engagement, their products, and customer relationships.

Workday is guided by the VIBE philosophy: Value, Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity for all. Workdayâ€™s annually published report, Global Blueprint for Belonging and Diversity, underscores the importance of technology and data to a sound DEI strategy.

In this webinar, Daniela Porr, Workday, and Mary Roemmele, Workday, discuss the following ideas:

â€¢ Workdayâ€™s global DEI Study shows a high level of organizational commitment to DEI, but strategy is lagging.

â€¢ How Workday treats DEI as foundational to its culture and as a feature in its solutions.

â€¢ As part of inclusion, Workday focuses on the accessibility of its products through partnerships among its workforce and its customers.

â€¢ Workdayâ€™s industry-leading Accessibility Advisory Council represents an innovative way to elevate accessibility and improve usability.
