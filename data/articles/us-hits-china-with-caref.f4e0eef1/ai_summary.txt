The US Trade Representative (USTR) has imposed tariffs on about $18bn of goods from China. The tariffs announced on 14 May follow a two-year review by the Biden administration of former President Donald Trump's trade policies under Section 301 of the US Trade Act. These new tariffs will affect less than 4% of the US's goods imports from China, but are expected to disrupt certain industries. The additional tariffs, to be implemented from mid-August, will largely affect electric-vehicle (EV) supply chains, with lithium-ion batteries making up about 80% of the goods now subject to tariffs. Several inputs in the EV supply chain will not face additional tariffs until 2026. The USTR has also proposed exclusions for 330 categories of industrial machinery, including 19 for parts used in solar components. Prior to this, licenses permitting Intel and Qualcomm to export certain semiconductors to Huawei were cancelled. Additionally, there is a proposal for a bill to limit exports of artificial intelligence models to China.
