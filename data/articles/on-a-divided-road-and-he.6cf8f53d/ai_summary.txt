Sri Lankan police are causing controversy by strictly enforcing an old law relating to vehicle ownership. Under the law, police have powers to check vehicle registration details, with the aim of preventing illegal activities related to vehicles, including theft. This has resulted in motorists having to ensure they have up-to-date ownership details for their vehicles. Previously, there was often a delay in updating the vehicle registration book when ownership changed. The enforcement of the law has also led to discussions about whether excessive regulation is dividing the country.
