    "The Supreme Court has ruled that both, the Election Commission and the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, were responsible for violating voters\u2019 rights by postponing the local government elections.",
    "A top official of the Elections Commission on hearing the top Court\u2019s ruling claimed that the Courts\u2019 pronouncement strengthened the Election Commission.",
    "The Daily Mirror reported President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s response with calculated brevity. \u201cWhile acknowledging that postponing the Local Government elections is a violation of the citizens\u2019 basic rights, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said he does not regret this decision.",
    "The President said he was not remorseful as the time was dedicated to ensuring the people\u2019s right to live and in maintaining their safety.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe President made these remarks while addressing the National Conference of the New People\u2019s Front (NPF) at the National Youth Services Council auditorium in Maharagama.",
    "\u201cHe explained that if he had devoted the time to conduct the Local Government elections, then achieving economic stability would not have been possible.\u201d",
    "The subject of this very brief missive is \u2018Hubris accumulation\u2019 and Nemesis which accompanies it.",

    "Hubris accumulation in leaders suddenly and surprisingly catapulted into high office is the result of excessive self-confidence and total and utter contempt for alternative points of view",
    "It is a terrible malaise leading to total detachment from reality. When it happens to leaders in a representative democracy, provided there is an adequate supply of buffoons to say \u2018hurrah\u2019 it results in autocratic governance that can be corrected only at the next election.",
    "Hubris Syndrome occurs when someone in a position of power develops a magnified and embellished view of themselves and their capabilities.",
    "Leaders afflicted with hubris syndrome generally respond to reason and logic with an uppity dismissal of \u2018up yours\u2019. The people therefore must be ready to tell him \u2018up yours\u2019 in the first available opportunity. That\u2019s the purpose of the next Presidential election.",
    "Hubris inevitably leads to the downfall of those who possess it. That unpreventable, inexorable outcome is known in history as a nemesis. Nemesis is the goddess of retribution and denotes the destruction, suffering or punishment that can follow in the wake of hubris."
