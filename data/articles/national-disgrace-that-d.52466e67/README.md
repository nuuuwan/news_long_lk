Our cultural identity as a compassionate Buddhist nation cannot ring true if we fail to protect the vulnerable among us, especially those who have chosen our country as their travel destination

Yesterday’s news carried a deeply troubling report from Ella that should concern every Sri Lankan citizen invested in our nation’s recovery and reputation. According to the Daily Mirror (13 May), a 26-year-old female foreign tourist was allegedly drugged, robbed of valuables worth Rs. 800,000, and pushed from a precipice near Rawana Ella, only to survive and report the crime. Most disturbing is that the alleged perpetrator is a 70-year-old retired police inspector now operating as a transport provider.

As someone dedicated to Sri Lanka’s economic revitalisation through human resource development, I find this incident profoundly alarming. It demands our collective attention and thoughtful response, not merely as an isolated criminal case but as a systemic threat to our national interests.

Economic recovery under threat

Our nation stands at a critical juncture. Having weathered severe economic challenges, we have identified tourism as a cornerstone of our recovery strategy. Each international visitor represents not merely a source of foreign exchange but a potential ambassador who can either champion or caution others about Sri Lanka as a destination.

This alleged crime strikes directly at the foundation of our recovery. A single incident of this nature can unravel months of painstaking work to rebuild our international image. Each report circulating in potential tourists’ home countries reinforces concerns about safety considerations that rank foremost in travel decisions.

What message does this send to the global community we are so ardently courting?

That even transportation services arranged through legitimate channels might conceal predators?

That those once entrusted with public safety may become the very source of danger?

These perceptions, once formed, require extraordinary effort to dispel.

A Vesak Day contradiction

The timing compounds the gravity of this situation. That such an act would allegedly occur on Vesak, when our nation celebrates the Buddha’s enlightenment and teachings of compassion, presents a stark contradiction. As lanterns illuminate our temples and homes, symbolising wisdom dispelling darkness, this incident casts a shadow over our collective conscience.

Sri Lanka proudly identifies as a Buddhist nation, yet incidents like these undermine the values we profess to uphold. International observers will inevitably question the disconnect between our cultural identity and the safety we provide visitors. This contradiction damages not just our tourism prospects but our standing as a society guided by principles of compassion and right conduct.

Institutional accountability required

This case raises troubling questions about institutional safeguards that have apparently failed at multiple levels:

How rigorous is the vetting process for transportation providers serving the tourism sector?

What oversight exists for monitoring those who interact directly with visitors?

What protocols ensure that those entering tourism after careers in sensitive positions are suitable for such roles?

The law enforcement community bears a particular responsibility to address this matter with unflinching commitment to justice. When the alleged perpetrator emerges from within their own ranks, the imperative for transparent and decisive action becomes even more pronounced.

Our judiciary must demonstrate that crimes against visitors will face swift consequences. Justice delayed is, in this context, national interest compromised.

Beyond punitive measures

While prosecution is necessary, it remains insufficient. This incident should catalyse a comprehensive review of tourism sector safety protocols. Every stakeholder, from government ministries to industry associations to individual operators, must participate in strengthening protective measures.

The tourism industry must embrace more rigorous self-regulation. Transportation providers should be subject to enhanced background checks, ongoing evaluation, and clear accountability mechanisms. Digital platforms connecting visitors with service providers must implement stronger verification protocols and safety features.

A call to collective action

As Sri Lankans, we cannot afford to dismiss this as an isolated incident unworthy of systemic response. Each of us bears responsibility for our national recovery and reputation. Those in positions of authority, whether in government, law enforcement, or judiciary, must demonstrate through concrete action that visitor safety represents a non-negotiable priority.

To the alleged victim, we as a nation owe not just justice but profound regret. To potential visitors monitoring this situation, we must demonstrate through decisive action, not merely reassuring words, that Sri Lanka remains committed to being a safe and welcoming destination.

Our economic recovery cannot be sustained without international confidence. Our cultural identity as a compassionate Buddhist nation cannot ring true if we fail to protect the vulnerable among us, especially those who have chosen our country as their travel destination.

The path forward requires not just addressing this specific case but strengthening the systems that prevent such incidents in the future. Our national interest demands nothing less.
