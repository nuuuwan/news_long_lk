Digital warfare is no longer theoretical or something that happens in isolated incidents, and the need for enhanced defensive strategies and systems is more important than ever. The cyber threat landscape is experiencing significant and concerning intensification by , critical infrastructure, and economic stability.

This escalation is evident in the growing trend of state-sponsored cyber attacks and advanced persistent threat group activity, and it will only continue to progress as technological advancements allow foreign adversaries to grow in sophistication.

State-sponsored cybercriminals have two main objectives: attacking infrastructure and stealing intellectual property (IP).

Infrastructure attacks typically involve gaining access to primary systems, such as those for energy, water, health care, and transportation, because these sectors are integral to economic prosperity and public safety, and their compromise can threaten both national and international stability.

State-sponsored IP theft often targets corporations and research institutions. While these attacks may not cause immediate consequences, they can significantly harm the target’s global output, potentially leading to economic disparity. Foreign actors also engage in cyber espionage, service disruption, and information manipulation, aiming to weaken democratic institutions and create civil unrest.

Most state-sponsored cybercriminals take advantage of zero-day attacks—computer software vulnerabilities that can be exploited before vendors can release a patch. But the most popular method for breaching computer systems is social engineering—tactics cybercriminals use to manipulate or deceive victims so they can gain control of a computer system or steal personal information.

Another emerging tactic involves distributing malware disguised as legitimate applications through trusted app stores. While the app may appear to function as advertised, it can secretly breach computer security and carry out malicious actions. These malware-infected apps can then move throughout the target network by first compromising computers with lower privileges before advancing to more protected systems.

Although it is often easy for security teams to identify the network connection and location of cybercriminals’ servers, understanding the malware’s next steps can be challenging even for experienced security professionals.

Another tactic bad actors use is one-click attacks, which disguise themselves as normal websites but can grant a hacker access to an entire system with a single click. One-click attacks are particularly dangerous in highly targeted scenarios because the vulnerabilities they exploit are challenging to discover. Hackers often conceal these vulnerabilities until they choose to exploit them, making such attacks highly effective for targeting high-profile organizations.

There is no shortage of strategies for bad actors to cause disruption within , and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) play a significant role in the scale of state-sponsored cybercrime. AI has diminished the barriers to becoming a hacker, and for more advanced criminals, AI helps them increase the volume and sophistication of their attacks.

Adopting a zero-trust security model is a pivotal approach to defending against evolving cyber threats. This model operates on the principle that an organization can implicitly trust no user or device, regardless of network location. The zero-trust strategy is particularly effective in addressing the challenges posed by modern cybersecurity threats, where remote work, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service applications have eroded traditional network perimeters.

By continuously verifying access requests and enforcing least-privilege principles—the cybersecurity strategy of restricting users, systems, and processes to only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their task—zero-trust security reduces the attack surface and prevents lateral movement within a compromised network. Additionally, insider threats, whether from employees, contractors, or third-party vendors, can be mitigated through continuous monitoring and role-based access restrictions, ensuring that even trusted individuals are subject to rigorous security controls.

The surge in foreign cyber threats demands a fundamental shift in cybersecurity strategies. Organizations and governments must prioritize cyber hygiene, implement robust mitigation practices, and embrace zero-trust principles to protect critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and sensitive data.

As cybercrime adversaries grow increasingly sophisticated, only proactive and adaptive security measures will ensure resilience against emerging threats.
