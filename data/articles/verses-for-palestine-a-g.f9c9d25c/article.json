    "The Free Palestine Movement on stage at the GLF",
    "The Galle Literary Festival, with its audience and focus on storytelling, provided a unique opportunity for the activist group to share Palestinian voices. As the global discourse on Palestine progresses, the Free Palestine Movement in Sri Lanka remains committed to amplifying Palestinian voices through literature and art \u2013 reminding audiences that stories, poetry, and history are among the most powerful tools of resistance. It also reinforces the soft power of GLF, in bringing these critical narratives to the forefront",
    "In the heated afternoon of what the Galle Literary Festival 2025 (GLF) calls \u2018The Garden Stage,\u2019 an open-mic session quietly happened on its first day. A mixture of Sri Lankan and other nationals formed a group which turned to literature and poetry to express the grievances of an almost forgotten nation in the Middle East.",
    "Many members of the Free Palestine Movement in Sri Lanka come from activist backgrounds, particularly in environmental and social justice causes. The movement itself is an informal collective, unregistered but highly organised, with over 300 members in Colombo and a smaller but committed group on Sri Lanka\u2019s south coast.",
    "\u201cWe started as environmental activists,\u201d Serena Ahangama Burgess explained. \u201cA lot of us were involved in the Aragalaya (Sri Lanka\u2019s 2022 anti-Government protests). We\u2019re essentially people who want to see humans live with equity.\u201d",
    "Their activism evolved organically into solidarity with Palestine, seeing the struggle as part of a broader fight against injustice. \u201cWe are highlighting the poetry that has emerged from Palestine. Over the past 75 years, we have witnessed the systematic erasure of a nation, a culture, and even a people. But when we amplify Palestinian voices \u2013 when we showcase poetry written by Palestinians \u2013 the world begins to see them not as the harmful stereotypes often portrayed, but as individuals with history, culture, rich lives, hopes, and dreams. Poetry and art become powerful expressions of their existence, and that\u2019s what we hoped to convey on stage,\u201d Burgess, who is a co-organiser of the literary protest, says.",
    "\u201cGenerally, those who support Palestine are also deeply moved by injustices around the world. Their concern isn\u2019t limited to the Palestinian cause \u2013 it\u2019s about humanity. It\u2019s about witnessing suffering in a world where resources exist in abundance yet remain so unequally distributed, forcing us to watch people struggle needlessly. Many of us are involved in other humanitarian efforts, and through this work, we\u2019ve connected with like-minded individuals who share a vision beyond personal existence \u2013 one that strives to create a world where more people can live with dignity and comfort.\u201d",
    "Mind Adventures Theatre\u00a0Company Artistic Director Tracy Holsinger at the GLF",
    "Literature as a platform for awareness",
    "Colombo-based theatre maker, arts educator, radio personality and Mind Adventures Theatre Company Artistic Director Tracy Holsinger, another key figure in the Palestinian protest event at the festival, emphasised the role of literature in raising awareness. \u201cThe role of literature is to inform and educate, as well as entertain,\u201d she said.",
    "The group had previously organised \u2018Letters from Gaza\u2019 at the 2024 GLF and regularly hosts similar events across Sri Lanka. \u201cSince October 2023, we have been doing readings like this all the time,\u201d Holsinger said. \u201cWe asked if we could do one here, and they said yes, no problem.\u201d",
    "The readings included works by renowned Palestinian poets such as Mahmoud Darwish and Kamal Nasr, offering audiences a deeper understanding of Palestinian identity, history, and suffering.",
    "\u201cSo we make a habit of trying to share the words of Palestinians themselves, so that people understand the terrible tragedy that is happening there through the words of the people who are actually experiencing it. And we keep doing it because I think you have to keep talking about it. You can\u2019t allow this level of imperialism and violence, especially with all these ridiculous new statements the US President has made about taking over Gaza and so on. In the face of all that, it\u2019s even more important to have a more realistic voice saying, \u2018hey, don\u2019t get caught up in all this, let\u2019s focus squarely on what is happening \u2013 let\u2019s not make up ceasefires.\u2019 It\u2019s time that there actually was a ceasefire,\u201d Holsinger said.",
    "The challenge of raising awareness",
    "Despite the significance of the session, organisers acknowledged the struggle to draw attention to the Palestinian cause. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t advertised,\u201d Burgess noted. \u201cBut any platform is a valuable platform to raise awareness for the suffering of other people.\u201d",
    "She pointed to the numbing effect of consumerism and capitalism as a major barrier to empathy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taken in by the capitalist machine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all out for winning, out for earning as much as we can, living these very consumerist lives \u2013 which is in conflict with our environmental and social justice values.\u201d",
    "For the Free Palestine Movement, activism extends beyond Palestine to a broader concern for global injustices. \u201cIf someone is pro-Palestine, they\u2019re usually feeling the pain of most injustices in the world,\u201d Burgess said.",
    "Seeds of solidarity: Building a community of empathy",
    "One of the group\u2019s initiatives, Seeds of Solidarity, says Serena Burgess, began as a project within a school in Colombo. \u201cWe approached the school and asked if we could have a Palestine stall during United Nations Day. The stall provided educational material on Gaza and the destruction of UN schools and offices in Palestine. We wanted to raise empathetic children \u2013 children who understand that even if something is happening far away, they should still care.\u201d",
    "She says the initiative also gave the activists a sense of community. \u201cThere are very few spaces where you can have these conversations. People are either disinterested or uncomfortable. It was nice to have friends who felt equally heartbroken by injustice.\u201d",
    "The symbolism of resistance",
    "The group\u2019s merchandise at their GLF stall included T-shirts that said, \u2018This is not a watermelon\u2019, referring to a symbol of Palestinian resistance. Since Israel banned the Palestinian flag in 1967, the watermelon \u2013 bearing the same red, white, green, and black colours \u2013 became a covert emblem of defiance. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a global symbol of solidarity.\u201d",
    "Other memorabilia for sale included Palestinian flags and the distinctly patterned black-and-white keffiyehs.",
    "The proceeds from the sales will go to The International Network for Aid, Relief, and Assistance (INARA), an organisation that provides medical care and assistance to children in conflict areas, including Palestine.",
    "A growing movement in Sri Lanka",
    "Burgess says although there were challenges, the response in Sri Lanka towards their cause has been overwhelmingly supportive. \u201cPeople are curious,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a single person ask, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 Instead, people want to help. Once you know that people are suffering like this, you want to do something.\u201d",
    "The GLF, with its audience and focus on storytelling, provided a unique opportunity for the activist group to share Palestinian voices. As the global discourse on Palestine progresses, the Free Palestine Movement in Sri Lanka remains committed to amplifying Palestinian voices through literature and art \u2013 reminding audiences that stories, poetry, and history are among the most powerful tools of resistance. It also reinforces the soft power of GLF, in bringing these critical narratives to the forefront."
