    "\u201cDuring my state visit to China, we secured one of our largest foreign direct investments \u2014 a $3.7B agreement with @SinopecNews to build an advanced oil refinery in Hambantota. This will boost exports, create jobs, and fuel economic growth,\u201d Mr. Dissanayake posted on social media platform X.

    "Sri Lanka\u2019s deal with the state-run Sinopec signals continuity in China\u2019s investment strategy in the island nation, after Mr. Dissanayake and his National People\u2019s Power captured power in 2024.
