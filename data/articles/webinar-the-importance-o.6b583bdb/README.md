Artificial intelligence and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) are transforming how people work. Used effectively and safely, GenAI has the potential to save time and improve efficiency, as well as bringing long-term business transformation. This is especially true in professional services such as legal, tax, accounting, and risk.

For professionals, using generic GenAI tools is not adequate; professionals need “professional-grade” GenAI solutions designed for their specific industries, and with the quality and robustness needed for professional work.

Morgan Lewis—a leading global law firm—has partnered with Thomson Reuters for its professional-grade GenAI solution. This solution, developed and continually tested by technical and subject matter experts, leverages Thomson Reuters’ unmatched content library to ensure the output is as accurate, transparent and accountable as possible.

AI benchmarking can improve both the development and the adoption of AI. However, it is one component in a broad range of ways to consider and understand the benefits AI delivers. Thomson Reuters works with its customers to help them understand and adopt new technologies, looking at both their immediate value and role in long- term transformation.
