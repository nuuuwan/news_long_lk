    "The deposition on August 28th by Peru of articles of ratification of UK accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) means that the UK will formally join the bloc on December 15th.\u00a0The economic impact\u00a0will be minimal,\u00a0other than in some niche areas, given that the UK\u2019s primary trade relationships are with the US and the EU. The main impact is instead geopolitical, with the UK boosting its economic and diplomatic presence in the Asia-Pacific.",
    "Unanimity was not required for the ratification process, with only six of the 11 CPTPP members needed to secure this outcome. The UK\u2019s accession was ratified by Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile and Peru. We expect Australia, Brunei, Canada, Malaysia and Mexico to ratify these protocols by end-2025.",
    "The inclusion of the UK in the CPTPP will not be a transformative economic move, either for its own economy or the existing members of the trade mega-pact.\u00a0Our\u00a0forecasts for UK growth\u00a0assign greater importance to domestic factors, including the beginning of monetary easing and the\u00a0direction of policy\u00a0under the new Labour government. In addition, the UK already enjoys existing trade agreements with most CPTPP members. Nevertheless, CPTPP accession may offer some new market access opportunities for British exporters, particularly in sectors where existing deals are absent, such as automotives and beverages exports. The provisions on services trade may give a lasting fillip to trade in financial services and professional services. Notably,\u00a0Malaysia and Brunei currently have no free-trade deals in place with the UK, and stand to potentially benefit the most from these developments\u00a0(once they complete their own ratification processes).",
    "The implications for future CPTPP enlargement are more paramount.\u00a0The UK\u2019s inclusion has expanded the list of CPTPP members who have grown increasingly wary of China\u2019s economic rise. Its accession may enhance the risk that China\u2019s own application to join the CPTPP will be vetoed. Nevertheless, the UK\u2019s more cautious approach to its ties with China to date (which has contrasted with the increasingly hawkish stances adopted by\u00a0Canada,\u00a0the EU\u00a0and\u00a0the US) suggests that these developments will not be a death knell for China\u2019s CPTPP aspirations.",
    "China\u2019s challenges in joining the CPTPP will instead reflect growing global friction stemming from its economic model. Its deepening reliance on external demand as a ballast for\u00a0slowing growth\u00a0haves fanned concerns over Chinese\u00a0industrial overcapacity, which are translating into a flurry of\u00a0global trade defence measures. This will complicate China\u2019s attempts to secure the unanimous consent required among all CPTPP members for a successful bid, particularly as some CPTPP signatories raise alarm bells around the potential \u201cflood\u201d of Chinese imports into their markets.\u00a0We expect Japan and Canada to adopt the strongest positions against Chinese inclusion, including as a result of quiet US lobbying against China\u2019s bid (even if the US continues to shun its own participation in the CPTPP). By contrast, Australia, which has enjoyed\u00a0a recent improvement in its ties\u00a0with China, may strike a softer tone.",
    "Most or all remaining CPTPP member states yet to ratify UK accession will do so before the year-end, or within 2025. That said, the\u00a0CPTPP\u2019s potential will be constrained by the emerging geopolitical reality of strategic competition between the West and China.",
