    "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country\u2019s orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA\u2019s launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come.\u00a0 Other space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up.\u00a0  A host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX\u2019s main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX\u2019s Starship.\u00a0 Some of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.",
    "But if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. \u201cMore players in the market is good for competition,\u201d says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. \u201cI think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.\u201d But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options.. A big lift There are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk\u2019s financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA\u2019s commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry.",
    "\u201cThey got government contracts from the very beginning,\u201d says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they\u2019re still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.\u201d SpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts.\u00a0 The company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. \u201cI think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,\u201d says Combs. \u201cSpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven\u2019t been. That\u2019s easier to do when you\u2019re backed by a billionaire.\u201d\u00a0 What\u2019s finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors\u2019 deep pockets.\u00a0  Some of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. \u201cThere is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,\u201d says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company. Rocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company\u2019s smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron\u2019s first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean.\u00a0 Another challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates\u2013backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year. Competitors are also rising for SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It\u2019s expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn\u2019t reusable, but it\u2019s less expensive than its predecessors, ULA\u2019s Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out.",
    "Mark Peller, the company\u2019s senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. \u201cOne is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,\u201d he says, \u201cand the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.\u201d He says more than 80 missions are already lined up.\u00a0 Vulcan\u2019s fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon\u2019s Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival. Meanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that\u2019s only a bit shorter than NASA\u2019s Space Launch System and SpaceX\u2019s Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads.\u00a0 Competition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe\u2019s heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency\u2019s temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.  China is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. \u201cThey had no less than seven \u2018commercial\u2019 space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,\u201d Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China\u2019s efforts. \u201cThey are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they\u2019re successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.\u201d The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer\u2019s reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap\u2019s Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a \u201cchopstick clamp\u201d recovery of the first stage, where it\u2019s grabbed by the launch tower\u2019s mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship. Glitches and government Before SpaceX\u2019s rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers.\u00a0 The process is not without its challenges. Boeing\u2019s Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn\u2019t land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit.\u00a0 SpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.",
    "Any company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner\u2019s malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023. Another issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry.",
    "Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump\u2019s NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX\u2019s Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon.\u00a0 It is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices. SpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review\u2019s requests for comment for this story. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,\u201d Samson says. \u201cI thought there\u2019d be a separation between [Musk\u2019s] interests, but now, it\u2019s hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.\u201d Regardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.\u201d Ramin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are  hide"
