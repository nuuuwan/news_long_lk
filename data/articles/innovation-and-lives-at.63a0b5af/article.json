    "Innovation does not promote smoking \u2014 it renders cigarettes obsolete by providing superior alternatives",
    "Sri Lanka has achieved progress in smoking control, with an adult smoking prevalence of 8.7% \u2014 well below global averages and approaching the 5% threshold that defines smoke-free status. Yet this overall figure masks disparities: male smoking rates reach 17.7%, suggesting that while aggregate numbers appear promising, significant challenges remain within specific demographics. Compounding these challenges, certain regulatory gaps may be hindering the country\u2019s progress toward this important milestone.",
    "The current landscape presents some policy inconsistencies worth examining. Cheap \u2018beedi\u2019 products \u2014 small, unfiltered hand-rolled tobacco items that account for 30% of cigarette consumption \u2014 remain widely available while largely avoiding excise taxation. At the same time, potentially safer alternatives face various regulatory challenges. Snus and heated tobacco products currently lack market authorisation, while nicotine pouches operate in an unregulated environment.",
    "These policies create an unintended situation where traditional combustible products often face fewer barriers than innovative, safer alternatives. The Path to Smoke-Free platform\u2019s assessment reflects this reality: Sri Lanka ranks poorly on accessibility and acceptability for innovative nicotine products (94 out of 101 countries), and while performing somewhat better on affordability (69 out of 101), still places near the bottom globally.",
    "A remarkable transformation",
    "Sweden\u2019s transformation offers a compelling roadmap for any nation serious about defeating smoking. While the European Union struggles with average smoking rates of 24%, Sweden has achieved just 5.3% \u2014 positioning it to become the EU\u2019s first smoke-free member state, reaching this goal 15 years ahead of the bloc\u2019s 2040 target.",
    "This was not achieved through wishful thinking or incremental measures. Sweden\u2019s success rests on what analysis reveals as a comprehensive approach combining traditional measures with three critical elements that make innovative nicotine products accessible, acceptable, and affordable to smokers seeking alternatives.",
    "The Swedish experience demonstrates that when countries harness innovation alongside traditional public health measures, the results are transformative. Sweden now reports 21.2% fewer smoking-related deaths, 36% fewer lung cancer deaths, and 31.3% fewer total cancer deaths compared to EU averages. These statistics represent thousands of lives saved and immeasurable reductions in human suffering.",
    "Sweden\u2019s regulatory framework rests on ensuring that innovative nicotine products meet three criteria that research among Swedish ex-smokers consistently identifies as crucial for successful smoking cessation.",
    "1.Accessibility: Ensuring innovative nicotine products are available through conventional and online retail channels, with comprehensive and relevant information for adults.",
    "2.Acceptability: Leveraging a variety of flavours and nicotine levels in innovative nicotine products to provide a compelling and realistic alternative to smoking.",
    "3.Affordability: Ensuring that taxes on innovative nicotine products remain at a level that does not discourage adults from choosing to use them over smoking due to cost.",
    "Innovation as ally, not enemy",
    "Critics often frame innovative nicotine products as threats to public health progress. Sweden\u2019s experience suggests the opposite: innovation accelerates progress toward smoke-free goals. The emergence of nicotine pouches in the 2010s notably transformed Sweden\u2019s trajectory, reaching demographics \u2014 especially women \u2014 who had been slower to adopt traditional snus.",
    "Swedish data reveals a near-perfect inverse correlation between oral nicotine product adoption and smoking decline. As innovative product usage climbed from roughly 11% to 16%, daily smoking rates dropped from about 11% to 5.4%. Longitudinal studies confirm that the vast majority of these users are former smokers who successfully transitioned away from cigarettes.",
    "This pattern reflects a fundamental insight: people do not quit smoking cold turkey in large numbers, but they will switch to dramatically safer delivery methods when given attractive options. Innovation does not promote smoking \u2014 it renders cigarettes obsolete by providing superior alternatives.",
    "The choice is Sri Lanka\u2019s",
    "Sweden\u2019s journey from typical European smoking rates to near-smoke-free status did not happen overnight, but it occurred faster than traditional projections suggested was possible. The comprehensive approach, combining traditional measures with innovation-friendly policies, has accelerated progress beyond what either approach could achieve alone, providing accessible, acceptable, and affordable alternatives.",
    "Sri Lanka faces this same choice today. The country can continue along current trajectories and perhaps reach smoke-free status through gradual decline. Or it can learn from Sweden\u2019s success, embrace comprehensive approaches that harness innovation alongside traditional measures, and accelerate its timeline while saving lives in the process.",
    "Time is not money in this equation \u2014 time is lives. Sri Lanka\u2019s policymakers hold the power to determine not only whether the country becomes smoke-free but also how many of their fellow citizens will benefit from that achievement. Sweden has shown the way. The question now is whether Sri Lanka will follow that path.",
