Facts:
- In the 19th century, sewage and coal tar pollutants in London's River Thames led to the development of opportunities in the circular economy.
- The need for waste repurposing is enormous, with more than 2 million tons of waste discharged into the world's waterways daily.
- Several large companies, and some small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are adopting the circular economy approach.
- The circular economy seeks to keep products and materials in use, a potential cost-cutting and profit-generating approach.
- SMEs can view byproducts and waste streams as resources to cut costs and generate revenue.
- Real-world examples of companies using the circular economy approach include Aeropowder, Ananas Anam, and an apparel company that turned surplus garments and fabric into revenue.
- To become part of the circular economy, companies need to: take stock of their materials flow; seek collaboration opportunities; leverage digital marketplaces; and treat the transition as a major change program.
- Digital marketplaces, like Rheaply, Materiom, and The Surpluss, can connect companies with surplus materials to those who can use them.
- The transition to the circular economy requires training, incentivizing innovation, and integrating the approach into the core business strategy.

Opinions:
- The journey of coal tar from pollutant to a commercial asset is a compelling case for businesses to embrace the circular economy.
- The circular economy isn't just a sustainability imperative for SMEs, but a significant business opportunity. 
- The relatively smaller scale of SMEs could be advantageous as they are generally more agile and can adapt to changes more rapidly than large corporations.
- Going circular requires a systemic shift in thinking and operations, even involving changes in procurement, sales, and design departments.
- Taking the first step in the circular economy, whether it's investigating the companyâ€™s waste streams for hidden value or collaborating with nearby firms, is crucial.
- Embracing the circular economy allows SMEs to gain substantial benefits for themselves, the planet, and its inhabitants.
