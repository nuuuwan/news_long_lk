- 🗳️ Upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka have sparked controversy over the term of office for the President and the duration of Parliament.
- 💼 Two parties have asked the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of replacing Article 30 in the 19th Amendment, which changed the President's term from six to five years.
- 📜 The 1978 Constitution's Article 83 stated that any changes to the President's term or Parliament's duration would need to be approved by a referendum, if either period exceeded six years.
- 🔄 After the 19th Amendment, Article 30 of the Constitution was altered, and the President's term was reduced to five years.
- 🗣️ There is widespread debate and confusion over this amendment, as it was not approved by a referendum, leading some to declare it invalid.
- 😞 The current President has apologized for the confusion and blamed the framers of the constitutional amendment for the error.
- 📑 A new bill in Parliament aims to replace the phrase "to over six years" in Article 83 with "to over five years."
- 🔍 This change could spur further confusion and controversy, as it is seen as a total replacement of the original provision and would also need to be submitted to a referendum.
- 😕 It remains uncertain if this change will create more complications, potentially delaying the presidential election until after a referendum.
- 💰 The query is how will this proposed legislative alteration will affect the current political landscape and the upcoming elections.
