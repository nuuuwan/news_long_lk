    "NASA is poised to launch Europa Clipper, a $5.2 billion mission to Jupiter\u2019s fourth-largest moon, as early as October 10. The spacecraft will blast off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. It will study Europa, a possible home for extraterrestrial life, through a series of flybys after reaching Jupiter in 2030.\u00a0 Europa isn\u2019t a craterous rock like our moon. Its surface is coated with ice, and based on telescope and spacecraft observations, it harbors a colossal liquid ocean in its interior that holds twice as much water as all of Earth\u2019s oceans combined. Europa also possesses some of life\u2019s critical building blocks: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. These conditions could be sufficient for life to have developed there, either in the depths of the ocean or in subsurface lakes.\u00a0 Europa Clipper isn\u2019t on the hunt for extraterrestrial life, however. Instead, its team hopes to assess the moon\u2019s habitability\u2014how well it could support life. The probe will use its range of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, magnetometers, and radars, to collect chemical, physical, and geological data in a series of flybys. Promising results could justify a mission to land on Europa and search for life.\u00a0 Early this year, everything seemed on track for the planned October launch. But in May, mission team members caught wind of a potential issue with Europa Clipper\u2019s electronics. Testing data had indicated the spacecraft\u2019s transistors, devices that regulate the flow of electricity on the probe, wouldn\u2019t survive the intense radiation consisting of charged particles trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field, which is 20,000 times stronger than Earth\u2019s.",
    "\u201cThe mission team was advised that similar parts were failing at lower radiation doses than expected,\u201d NASA said in a statement. Disassembling the spacecraft and replacing faulty transistors could have pushed the mission\u2019s launch window well past October.\u00a0 After months of followup testing at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Applied Physics Laboratory, researchers concluded that any potential transistor damage wouldn\u2019t impair mission operations. It was determined that the transistors could be heated to heal damage, and the 20-day breaks between large radiation exposures would offer enough recovery time. According to the New York Times, the spacecraft will also carry a box of the probe\u2019s various transistors so that the team can monitor for damage, a bit like canaries in a coal mine. On September 9, Europa Clipper passed a milestone review called Key Decision Point E, approving it to proceed for launch.\u00a0 After arriving in orbit around Jupiter, Europa Clipper will conduct 49 close flybys of Europa. At its closest, the spacecraft will come within 16 miles (26 kilometers) of the surface for detailed observations.\u00a0 For more on Europa Clipper, see MIT Technology Review\u2019s feature on the mission. hide"
