    "For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s the season of the sniffles. As the weather turns, we\u2019re all spending more time indoors. The kids have been back at school for a couple of months. And cold germs are everywhere. My youngest started school this year, and along with artwork and seedlings, she has also been bringing home lots of lovely bugs to share with the rest of her family. As she coughed directly into my face for what felt like the hundredth time, I started to wonder if there was anything I could do to stop this endless cycle of winter illnesses. We all got our flu jabs a month ago. Why couldn\u2019t we get a vaccine to protect us against the common cold, too?

But not impossible. There\u2019s still hope. Let me explain.",
    "Technically, colds are infections that affect your nose and throat, causing symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and generally feeling like garbage. Unlike some other infections,\u2014covid-19, for example\u2014they aren\u2019t defined by the specific virus that causes them. That\u2019s because there are a lot of viruses that cause colds, including rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and even seasonal coronaviruses (they don\u2019t all cause covid!). Within those virus families, there are many different variants.",
    "Take rhinoviruses, for example. These viruses are thought to be behind most colds. They\u2019re human viruses\u2014over the course of evolution, they have become perfectly adapted to infecting us, rapidly multiplying in our noses and airways to make us sick. There are around 180 rhinovirus variants, says Gary McLean, a molecular immunologist at Imperial College London in the UK. Once you factor in the other cold-causing viruses, there are around 280 variants all told. That\u2019s 280 suspects behind the cough that my daughter sprayed into my face. It\u2019s going to be really hard to make a vaccine that will offer protection against all of them. The second challenge lies in the prevalence of those variants. Scientists tailor flu and covid vaccines to whatever strain happens to be circulating. Months before flu season starts, the World Health Organization advises countries on which strains their vaccines should protect against. Early recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere can be based on which strains seem to be dominant in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. Related StoryHow measuring vaccine hesitancy could help health professionals tackle itRead next That approach wouldn\u2019t work for the common cold, because all those hundreds of variants are circulating all the time, says McLean. That\u2019s not to say that people haven\u2019t tried to make a cold vaccine. There was a flurry of interest in the 1960s and \u201970s, when scientists made valiant efforts to develop vaccines for the common cold. Sadly, they all failed. And we haven\u2019t made much progress since then. In 2022, a team of researchers reviewed all the research that had been published up to that year. They\u00a0only identified one clinical trial\u2014and it was conducted back in 1965. Interest has certainly died down since then, too. Some question whether a cold vaccine is even worth the effort. After all, most colds don\u2019t require much in the way of treatment and don\u2019t last more than a week or two. There are many, many more dangerous viruses out there we could be focusing on.",
    "And while cold viruses do mutate and evolve, no one really expects them to cause the next pandemic, says McLean. They\u2019ve evolved to cause mild disease in humans\u2014something they\u2019ve been doing successfully for a long, long time. Flu viruses\u2014which can cause serious illness, disability, or even death\u2014pose a much bigger risk, so they probably deserve more attention. But colds are still irritating, disruptive, and potentially harmful. Rhinoviruses are\u00a0considered to be the leading cause of human infectious disease. They can cause pneumonia in children and older adults. And once you add up doctor visits, medication, and missed work, the economic cost of colds is pretty hefty: a\u00a02003 study put it at $40 billion per year for the US alone. So it\u2019s reassuring that we needn\u2019t abandon all hope: Some scientists are making progress! McLean and his colleagues are working on ways to prepare the immune systems of people with asthma and lung diseases to potentially protect them from cold viruses. And a team at Emory University has developed a vaccine that appears to protect monkeys from around a third of rhinoviruses. There\u2019s still a long way to go. Don\u2019t expect a cold vaccine to materialize in the next five years, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d says Michael Boeckh, an infectious-disease researcher at Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. \u201cBut will it at some point happen? Possibly.\u201d At the end of our Zoom call, perhaps after reading the disappointed expression on my sniffling, cold-riddled face (yes, I did end up catching my daughter\u2019s cold), McLean told me he hoped he was \u201cpositive enough.\u201d He admitted that he used to be more optimistic about a cold vaccine. But he hasn\u2019t given up hope. He\u2019s even running a trial of a potential new vaccine in people, although he wouldn\u2019t reveal the details. \u201cIt could be done,\u201d he said.
