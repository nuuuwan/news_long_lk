Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the US\u2019s health agencies, has been facing questions from senators as part of his confirmation hearing for the role. So far, it\u2019s been a dramatic watch, with plenty of fiery exchanges, screams from audience members, and damaging revelations.  There\u2019s also been a lot of discussion about vaccines. Kennedy has long been a vocal critic of vaccines. He has spread misinformation about the effects of vaccines. He\u2019s petitioned the government to revoke the approval of vaccines. He\u2019s sued pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines.\u00a0 Related StoryHow covid conspiracy theories led to an alarming resurgence in AIDS denialismWidespread distrust of our public health system is reviving long-debunked ideas on HIV and AIDS\u2014and energizing a broad movement that questions the foundations of disease prevention.",
    "Kennedy has his supporters. But not everyone who opts not to vaccinate shares his worldview. There are lots of reasons why people don\u2019t vaccinate themselves or their children.",
    "Understanding those reasons will help us tackle an issue considered to be a huge global health problem today. And plenty of researchers are working on tools to do just that. Jonathan Kantor is one of them. Kantor, who is jointly affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the University of Oxford in the UK, has been developing a scale to measure and assess \u201cvaccine hesitancy.\u201d",
    "That term is what best captures the diverse thoughts and opinions held by people who don\u2019t get vaccinated, says Kantor. \u201cWe used to tend more toward [calling] someone \u2026 a vaccine refuser or denier,\u201d he says. But while some people under this umbrella will be stridently opposed to vaccines for various reasons, not all of them will be. Some may be unsure or ambivalent. Some might have specific fears, perhaps about side effects or even about needle injections. Vaccine hesitancy is shared by \u201ca very heterogeneous group,\u201d says Kantor. That group includes \u201ceveryone from those who have a little bit of wariness \u2026 and want a little bit more information \u2026 to those who are strongly opposed and feel that it is their mission in life to spread the gospel regarding the risks of vaccination.\u201d To begin understanding where individuals sit on this spectrum and why, Kantor and his colleagues scoured published research on vaccine hesitancy. They sent surveys to 50 people, asking them detailed questions about their feelings on vaccines. The researchers were looking for themes: Which issues kept cropping up? They found that prominent concerns about vaccines tend to fall into three categories: beliefs, pain, and deliberation. Beliefs might be along the lines of \u201cIt is unhealthy for children to be vaccinated as much as they are today.\u201d Concerns around pain center more on the immediate consequences of the vaccination, such as fears about the injection. And deliberation refers to the need some people feel to \u201cdo their own research.\u201d  Kantor and his colleagues used their findings to develop a 13-question survey, which they trialed in 500 people from the UK and 500 more from the US. They found that responses to the questionnaire could predict whether someone had been vaccinated against covid-19.

    "Theirs is not the first vaccine hesitancy scale out there\u2014similar questionnaires have been developed by others, often focusing on parents\u2019 feelings about their children\u2019s vaccinations. But Kantor says this is the first to incorporate the theme of deliberation\u2014a concept that seems to have become more popular during the early days of covid-19 vaccination rollouts. Nicole Vike at the University of Cincinnati and her colleagues are taking a different approach. They say research has suggested that how people feel about risks and rewards seems to influence whether they get vaccinated (although not necessarily in a simple or direct manner). Vike\u2019s team surveyed over 4,000 people to better understand this link, asking them information about themselves and how they felt about a series of pictures of sports, nature scenes, cute and aggressive animals, and so on. Using machine learning, they built a model that could predict, from these results, whether a person would be likely to get vaccinated against covid-19.",
    "This survey could be easily distributed to thousands of people and is subtle enough that people taking it might not realize it is gathering information about their vaccine choices, Vike and her colleagues wrote in a paper describing their research. And the information collected could help public health centers understand where there is demand for vaccines, and conversely, where outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases might be more likely. Models like these could be helpful in combating vaccine hesitancy, says Ashlesha Kaushik, vice president of the Iowa Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The information could enable health agencies to deliver tailored information and support to specific communities that share similar concerns, she says. Kantor, who is a practicing physician, hopes his questionnaire could offer doctors and other health professionals insight into their patients\u2019 concerns and suggest ways to address them. It isn\u2019t always practical for doctors to sit down with their patients for lengthy, in-depth discussions about the merits and shortfalls of vaccines. But if a patient can spend a few minutes filling out a questionnaire before the appointment, the doctor will have a starting point for steering a respectful and fruitful conversation about the subject. When it comes to vaccine hesitancy, we need all the insight we can get. Vaccines prevent millions of deaths every year. One and half million children under the age of five die every year from vaccine-preventable diseases, according to the children\u2019s charity UNICEF. In 2019, the World Health Organization included \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d on its list of 10 threats to global health.  When vaccination rates drop, we start to see outbreaks of the diseases the vaccines protect against. We\u2019ve seen this a lot recently with measles, which is incredibly infectious. Sixteen measles outbreaks were reported in the US in 2024. Globally, over 22 million children missed their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2023, and measles cases rose by 20%. Over 107,000 people around the world died from measles that year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of them were children. Vaccine hesitancy is dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s really creating a threatening environment for these vaccine-preventable diseases to make a comeback,\u201d says Kaushik.\u00a0 Kantor agrees: \u201cAnything we can do to help mitigate that, I think, is great.\u201d",
    "Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive In 2021, my former colleague Tanya Basu wrote a guide to having discussions about vaccines with people who are hesitant. Kindness and nonjudgmentalism will get you far, she wrote. In December 2020, as covid-19 ran rampant around the world, doctors took to social media platforms like TikTok to allay fears around the vaccine. Sharing their personal experiences was important\u2014but not without risk, A.W. Ohlheiser reported at the time.",
    "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is currently in the spotlight for his views on vaccines. But he has also spread harmful misinformation about HIV and AIDS, as Anna Merlan reported. mRNA vaccines have played a vital role in the covid-19 pandemic, and in 2023, the researchers who pioneered the science behind them were awarded a Nobel Prize. Here\u2019s what\u2019s next for mRNA vaccines. Vaccines are estimated to have averted 154 million deaths in the last 50 years. That number includes 146 million children under the age of five. That\u2019s partly why childhood vaccines are a public health success story. From around the web As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Senate hearing continued this week, so did the revelations of his misguided beliefs about health and vaccines. Kennedy, who has called himself \u201can expert on vaccines,\u201d said in 2021 that \u201cwe should not be giving Black people the same vaccine schedule that\u2019s given to whites, because their immune system is better than ours\u201d\u2014a claim that is not supported by evidence. (The Washington Post) And in past email exchanges with his niece, a primary-care physician at NYC Health + Hospitals in New York City, RFK Jr. made repeated false claims about covid-19 vaccinations and questioned the value of annual flu vaccinations.
