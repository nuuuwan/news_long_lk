    "OpenAI is launching Study Mode, a version of ChatGPT for college students that it promises will act less like a lookup tool and more like a friendly, always-available tutor. It\u2019s part of a wider push by the company to get AI more embedded into classrooms when the new academic year starts in September. A demonstration for reporters from OpenAI showed what happens when a student asks Study Mode about an academic subject like game theory. The chatbot begins by asking what the student wants to know and then attempts to build an exchange, where the pair work methodically toward the answer together. OpenAI says the tool was built after consulting with pedagogy experts from over 40 institutions.  A handful of college students who were part of OpenAI\u2019s testing cohort\u2014hailing from Princeton, Wharton, and the University of Minnesota\u2014shared positive reviews of Study Mode, saying it did a good job of checking their understanding and adapting to their pace. The learning approaches that OpenAI has programmed into Study Mode, which are based partially on Socratic methods, appear sound, says Christopher Harris, an educator in New York who has created a curriculum aimed at AI literacy. They might grant educators more confidence about allowing, or even encouraging, their students to use AI. \u201cProfessors will see this as working with them in support of learning as opposed to just being a way for students to cheat on assignments,\u201d he says.",
    "But there\u2019s a more ambitious vision behind Study Mode. As demonstrated in OpenAI\u2019s recent partnership with leading teachers\u2019 unions, the company is currently trying to rebrand chatbots as tools for personalized learning rather than cheating. Part of this promise is that AI will act like the expensive human tutors that currently only the most well-off students\u2019 families can typically afford. \u201cWe can begin to close the gap between those with access to learning resources and high-quality education and those who have been historically left behind,\u201d says OpenAI\u2019s head of education. Leah Belsky.",
    "But painting Study Mode as an education equalizer obfuscates one glaring problem. Underneath the hood, it is not a tool trained exclusively on academic textbooks and other approved materials\u2014it\u2019s more like the same old ChatGPT, tuned with a new conversation filter that simply governs how it responds to students, encouraging fewer answers and more explanations.\u00a0 This AI tutor, therefore, more resembles what you\u2019d get if you hired a human tutor who has read every required textbook, but also every flawed explanation of the subject ever posted to Reddit, Tumblr, and the farthest reaches of the web. And because of the way AI works, you can\u2019t expect it to distinguish right information from wrong.\u00a0 Professors encouraging their students to use it run the risk of it teaching them to approach problems in the wrong way\u2014or worse, being taught material that is fabricated or entirely false.\u00a0 Related StoryAI\u2019s giants want to take over the classroomOpenAI and Anthropic say AI can help students learn\u2014not just cheat\u2014even if real-world use suggests otherwise.",
    "Given this limitation, I asked OpenAI if Study Mode is limited to particular subjects. The company said no\u2014students will be able to use it to discuss anything they\u2019d normally talk to ChatGPT about.\u00a0 It\u2019s true that access to human tutors\u2014which for certain subjects can cost upward of $200 an hour\u2014is typically for the elite few. The notion that AI models can spread the benefits of tutoring to the masses holds an allure. Indeed, it is backed up by at least some early research that shows AI models can adapt to individual learning styles and backgrounds. But this improvement comes with a hidden cost. Tools like Study Mode, at least for now, take a shortcut by using large language models\u2019 humanlike conversational style without fixing their inherent flaws.\u00a0 OpenAI also acknowledges that this tool won\u2019t prevent a student who\u2019s frustrated and wants an answer from simply going back to normal ChatGPT. \u201cIf someone wants to subvert learning, and sort of get answers and take the easier route, that is possible,\u201d Belsky says.\u00a0 However, one thing going for Study Mode, the students say, is that it\u2019s simply more fun to study with a chatbot that\u2019s always encouraging you along than to stare at a textbook on Bayesian theorem for the hundredth time. \u201cIt\u2019s like the reward signal of like, oh, wait, I can learn this small thing,\u201d says Maggie Wang, a student from Princeton who tested it. The tool is free for now, but Praja Tickoo, a student from Wharton, says it wouldn\u2019t have to be for him to use it. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely something I would be willing to pay for,\u201d he says.  hide"
