Leaders who wish to encourage stronger participation in meetings need to deepen their understanding of their teamâ€™s unique dynamics, suggests an article in Harvard Business Review. Leaders should seek to understand individual strengths, weaknesses, aspirations and fears within their team, and foster an environment that addresses any barriers to participation. One-on-one meetings can help to develop these understandings. Additionally, creating a safe and supportive team culture is crucial in fostering a level of psychological safety that encourages participation during meetings. To establish this culture, leaders should define the ideal team behaviours, model these behaviours themselves and celebrate when they are exhibited by others. Further recommendations include challenging traditional meeting structures and addressing common meeting distractions. Leaders should also strive to ensure all voices are heard equally in meetings to create a broader and more inclusive conversation.
