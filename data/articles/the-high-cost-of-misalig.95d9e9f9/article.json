    "Business leaders are feeling acute pressure to ramp up their company\u2019s data and analytics capabilities \u2014 and fast \u2014 or risk falling behind more data-savvy competitors. If only the path to success were that straightforward! In our previous research, we found that capitalizing on data and analytics requires creating a data culture, obtaining senior leadership commitment, acquiring data and analytics skills and competencies, as well as empowering employees. And each of these dimensions is necessary just to start the analytics journey.",
    "But what does success here really mean? How should companies measure it?",
    "The metrics that characterize digital transformation success have evolved from just a few years ago. In a 2018 Gartner survey of data and analytics (D&A) leaders and chief data officers (CDOs), respondents ranked three key internal company activities as the most important in achieving data and analytics success: creating a data-driven culture, adopting advanced analytics capabilities, and employing a well-developed data and analytics implementation strategy. But when Gartner ran the 2022 version of this survey, respondents reported their top priority was now external marketplace focused: These investments need to create business value by helping the company achieve its growth goals. This evolution of interest and priority shifting to the return and accountability of data and analytics is a natural progression aimed at answering the \u201cso what?\u201d question.",
    "A critical question for companies undergoing digital transformations is: How and where do companies\u2019 investments in new and improved data and analytic capabilities contribute to tangible business benefits like profitability and growth? Should they invest in talent? Technology? Culture? According to our research, which measures the impact of analytics development on business performance metrics, the path to actual value creation is nuanced and not so straightforward.\u00a0It is not only the level of analytics that matters, but also how aligned analytics capabilities are with business goals.",
    "How Companies Create Value with Analytics",
    "To investigate the impact of alignment in analytics on business performance, we surveyed 323 companies undergoing data and analytics transformations (143 of these companies were U.S.-based, 180 were based in India). The participating companies represented a range of sectors, including telecom, health care, energy, CPG, automotive, logistics, and professional and financial services. Forty-three percent of the companies\u2019 annual sales exceeded $100 million, and another 20% had sales that topped $1 billion.",
    "In order to understand the impact of being aligned on the level of business performance, we surveyed two-person dyads \u2014 an executive and a data analytics manager \u2014 from each of the 323 companies. We were purposeful in choosing and comparing the senior executive\u2019s strategic \u201ccomputing in the clouds\u201d perspective to the data analysts\u2019 \u201crubber meets the road\u201d operational point of view. On average, senior executives had more than a decade of experience in their current roles, which included directorships of core business functions (12.6%), vice president (16.6%), and other members of the C-suite (16.8%).",

    "What value creation means today.",
    "In addition to answering questions about their companies\u2019 current data analytic capabilities and stage of data maturity (low, medium, or high), the senior executives were also asked to compare their companies\u2019 performance to major competitors on eight KPIs (i.e., business outcomes) using a five-point scale (i.e., much worse, somewhat worse, about the same, somewhat better, or much better than competitors).\u00a0 Three KPIs were growth measures: market share growth, sales growth, and profit growth. Two were financial metrics: revenue and profitability. And three were customer-centric outcomes: customer acquisition, customer retention, and customer satisfaction.",
    "The senior executives were also required to identify a qualified manager from their company with operational experience in data, analytics, and/or IT to participate in the study. The resulting 323 operational data managers had an average of more than nine years of work experience. These managers also responded to the question of stage of data maturity (low, medium, or high). It is important to point out that the senior executives were not aware of the survey questions to be asked of the managers, minimizing the risk of selection bias in our findings.",
    "The survey question completed by both senior leaders and data managers regarding their company\u2019s current level of data capabilities (low, medium, or high maturity, defined below) was central to our analysis of the within-company dyads, alignment, and business performance.",
    "Firms chose a low maturity level if they were engaged in manual compilation of data reports, non-standardized data reporting, data silos, and a lack of systematic dissemination across the organization. In companies that chose the medium level of maturity, data were collected and analyzed more deliberately with standardized data reports shared across an organization-wide platform. Data and analytics began to play a direct role in informing key business decisions. At high maturity levels, firms used data reports as the foundation for all processes and decision-making. In these organizations, no decision-making occurred without relying on appropriate data and insights.",
    "In our findings, we discovered a surprising trend. As might be expected, we found improved performance on all KPIs when firms move up the data maturity spectrum. The return on investing in talent and technology paid solid dividends at the start of a company\u2019s data and analytics journey: Companies improving from low to medium maturity enjoyed single-digit improvements in both growth KPIs (8.7%) and financial KPIs (8.9%), and near double-digit gains (9.9%) in customer-related KPIs. However, the benefits of further investments diminished as companies advanced beyond the middle stage of data maturity.",
    "In fact, as firms progressed beyond the mid-range of maturity and achieved high levels of data and analytics capabilities, their business performance across all KPI categories, while still in positive territory, dropped off considerably (on average 32.83%) from the peak levels cited above for the mid-level firms. Growth KPIs decreased to 7.8% (a 9.6% drop), while financial and customer KPIs dropped to 4.85% (a whopping 45.5% drop), and to 5.59% (another whopping drop of 43.4%), respectively. These findings indicate a ceiling effect at this middle stage of data maturity; i.e., companies need \u201csomething more\u201d than just additional investments in talent and technology to get them over the top.",
    "Digging deeper into the results, we found important and nuanced implications for companies undergoing or considering data analytics transformations. When we account for differences in \u201cdata maturity alignment\u201d between senior leaders and data analysts within the same organization, we found an even sharper picture of diverging performance on the three KPI categories.",
    "The Misaligned Companies",
    "Companies at the low end of data maturity derive benefits in business performance when making investments that improve their capabilities to the mid-range of maturity, despite being internally misaligned. However, any KPIs gains here disappear, and actually drop into negative territory, when the data transformation efforts of misaligned companies move from the mid-range of data maturity to the high end.",
    "The transition from medium to high data maturity seems to be a chasm, as this jump requires more than just investment in data and analytics talent, tools, and technology. In order to successfully cross this divide, companies need to be savvy not only in data analytics competencies but, and more importantly, be aligned internally on their level of data maturity \u2014 i.e., what the company is truly capable of and whether people see eye-to-eye on their data analytics competency.",

    "The Aligned Companies",
    "Within-company alignment delivers positive KPIs at each transition stage of data maturity, particularly when moving from medium to high capabilities (and not just when moving from low to medium, as shown for misaligned companies in the first column of Exhibit 1). When aligned, companies benefit from steady and continuous improvements in business outcomes as they transition from the mid-range to the high-end of data maturity.",
    "Aligning the Organization",
    "Companies at all levels of data maturity, especially those that have begun their digital transformation journey, may need to pump the breaks on further talent and technology investments and ensure better alignment between senior leaders and those tasked with more operational data roles. The importance of internal alignment becomes especially poignant along the analytics journey when companies reach the medium stage and are attempting to move into the high stage of the data maturity. Our results clearly show that while a basic level of analytics may be sufficient when companies are still in the low to medium range of data maturity, it becomes insufficient and alignment in analytics capability emerges as a necessary factor in the medium to high data maturity stage if companies want to reap the rewards of investment in analytics. We provide companies with a self-assessment tool and key action steps to assist firms in enhancing their internal alignment regarding data and analytics capabilities.",
    "The seven dimensions referred to in Exhibit 2 have been identified as impacting a firm\u2019s analytics readiness (AR) and are helpful in gauging alignment. Two individuals within an organization (an executive and an analyst) need to answer these questions independently.",
    "Use of the tool reveals four\u00a0insights: First,\u00a0the more items you answer in the affirmative, the closer you are to having the key ingredients that help generate superior business performance. Those items where a negative response exists identify areas (and action steps) needed for improvement. Second, comparing responses from a senior leader and operational data manager will help identify areas of (mis)alignment and lead to informed discussions among the wider team about where and how to change areas of disagreement. (Having other team members also complete the tool can be useful to generate further engagement and insight.) Third, a periodic checklist review will enable senior leaders to keep a finger on the pulse and monitor the impact of inevitable internal changes in their organization\u2019s digital transformation journey to maintain within-company alignment and continuously improve business performance. Finally, to arrive at a more valid (and conservative) alignment assessment, companies should include individuals at the senior and operational levels who do not have a direct reporting relationship; a close relationship among respondents may inflate the level of alignment.",

    "While companies across industries strive to be more analytics-driven and achieve data and analytics superiority, our findings tell a clear and compelling story that business leaders have to pay more attention to. Understanding the interplay between alignment and the level of data maturity can help companies boost and maintain their performance in growth, financial, and customer-related outcomes.\u00a0 By using our checklist, leaders have a line of sight into where they currently are in terms of alignment and how to move forward to create further value.\u00a0 The action steps outlined here will help leaders identify and address weaknesses while enhancing their strengths in terms of both analytic maturity and alignment which, together, are essential to deliver real and sustained competitive advantage.",
