# These board games want you to beat climate change

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- A number of games are being developed that address the topic of climate change, for instance, a version of the bestselling game Catan was released this summer focusing on the climate crisis.
- Daybreak, a cooperative board game about combating climate change, was released in late 2023 by a team that includes the creator of the game Pandemic.
- Daybreak features multiple detailed components and requires players to reduce pollution and mitigate environmental disasters.
- Catan Studios announced a version of its game focused on climate change called New Energies, released in summer 2023. The game involves generating energy from either renewable sources or fossil fuels.
- The original Settlers of Catan game and its related games have sold over 45 million copies worldwide since its 1995 release.

Opinions:
- The author expressed doubt about whether these games on climate change could be enjoyable.
- The author suggested that Daybreak was complicated and challenging, perhaps too representative of the real-world climate change struggles. She found herself stressed about climate issues after playing.
- The author expressed concern about the messages New Energies would send to players, doubting if a simple game could accurately portray the urgent and complex nature of climate change.
- Despite appreciating the incorporation of climate change issues in games, the author confessed an impulse to opt for other alternatives on game nights due to the distressing reflections on real-world climate crisis.

It‚Äôs game night, and I‚Äôm crossing my fingers, hoping for a hurricane.¬† I roll the die and it clatters across the board, tumbling to a stop to reveal a tiny icon of a tree stump. Bad news: I just triggered deforestation in the Amazon. That seals it. I failed to stop climate change‚Äîat least this board-game representation of it.  The urgent need to address climate change might seem like unlikely fodder for a fun evening. But a growing number of games are attempting to take on the topic, including a version of the bestseller Catan released this summer. As a climate reporter, I was curious about whether games could, even abstractly, represent the challenge of the climate crisis. Perhaps more crucially, could they possibly be any fun?

My investigation started with Daybreak, a board game released in late 2023 by a team that includes the creator of Pandemic (infectious disease‚Äîanother famously light topic for a game). Daybreak is a cooperative game where players work together to cut emissions and survive disasters. The group either wins or loses as a whole. When I opened the box, it was immediately clear that this wouldn‚Äôt be for the faint of heart. There are hundreds of tiny cardboard and wooden pieces, three different card decks, and a surprisingly thick rule book. Setting it up, learning the rules, and playing for the first time took over two hours.

Daybreak, a cooperative board game about stopping climate change.COURTESY OF CMYK   Daybreak is full of details, and I was struck by how many of them it gets right. Not only are there cards representing everything from walkable cities to methane removal, but each features a QR code players can use to learn more. In each turn, players deploy technologies or enact policies to cut climate pollution. Just as in real life, emissions have negative effects. Winning requires slashing emissions to net zero (the point where whatever‚Äôs emitted can be soaked up by forests, oceans, or direct air capture). But there are multiple ways for the whole group to lose, including letting the global average temperature increase by 2 ¬∞C or simply running out of turns. ¬†In an embarrassing turn of events for someone who spends most of her waking hours thinking about climate change, nearly every round of Daybreak I played ended in failure. Adding insult to injury, I‚Äôm not entirely sure that I was having fun. Sure, the abstract puzzle was engaging and challenging, and after a loss, I‚Äôd be checking the clock, seeing if there was time to play again. But once all the pieces were back in the box, I went to bed obsessing about heat waves and fossil-fuel disinformation. The game was perhaps representing climate change a little bit too well.

I wondered if a new edition of a classic would fare better. Catan, formerly Settlers of Catan, and its related games have sold over 45 million copies worldwide since the original‚Äôs release in 1995. The game‚Äôs object is to build roads and settlements, setting up a civilization.¬† In late 2023, Catan Studios announced that it would be releasing a version of its game called New Energies, focused on climate change. The new edition, out this summer, preserves the same central premise as the original. But this time, players will also construct power plants, generating energy with either fossil fuels or renewables. Fossil fuels are cheaper and allow for quicker expansion, but they lead to pollution, which can harm players‚Äô societies and even end the game early. Before I got my hands on the game, I spoke with one of its creators, Benjamin Teuber, who developed the game with his late father, Klaus Teuber, the mastermind behind the original Catan. To Teuber, climate change is a more natural fit for a game than one might expect. ‚ÄúWe believe that a good game is always around a dilemma,‚Äù he told me. The key is to simplify the problem sufficiently, a challenge that took the team dozens of iterations while developing New Energies. But he also thinks there‚Äôs a need to be at least somewhat encouraging. ‚ÄúWhile we have a severe topic, or maybe even especially because we have a severe topic, you can‚Äôt scare off the people by making them just have a shitty evening,‚Äù Teuber says. In New Energies, the first to gain 10 points wins, regardless of how polluting that player‚Äôs individual energy supply is. But if players collectively build too many fossil-fuel plants and pollution gets too high, the game ends early, in which case whoever has done the most work to clean up their own energy supply is named the winner.

That‚Äôs what happened the first time I tested out the game. While I had been lagging in points, I ended up taking the win, because I had built more renewable power plants than my competitors. This relatively rosy ending had me conflicted. On one hand, I was delighted, even if it felt like a consolation prize.¬† But I found myself fretting over the messages that New Energies will send to players. A simple game that crowns a winner may be more playable, but it doesn‚Äôt represent how complicated the climate crisis is, or how urgently we need to address it.¬† I‚Äôm glad climate change has a spot on my game shelf, and I hope these and other games find their audiences and get people thinking about the issues. But I‚Äôll understand the impulse to reach for other options when game night rolls around, because I can‚Äôt help but dwell on the fact that in the real world, we won‚Äôt get to reset the pieces and try again. hide
