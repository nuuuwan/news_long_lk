    "Since the heyday of radio, records, cassette tapes, and MP3 players, the branding of sound has evolved from broad genres like rock and hip-hop to \u201cparanormal dark cabaret afternoon\u201d and \u201csynth space,\u201d and streaming has become the default. Radio DJs have been replaced by artificial intelligence, and the ritual of discovering something new is neatly packaged in a 30-song playlist, refreshed weekly. The only rule in music streaming, as in any other industry these days, is personalization. But what we\u2019ve gained in convenience, we\u2019ve lost in curiosity. Sure, our unlimited access lets us listen to Swedish tropical house or New Jersey hardcore, but this abundance of choice actually makes our listening experience less expansive or eclectic.  Most of us access music through streaming services: over 600 million of us worldwide, to be exact. And claiming over 30.5% of this population, nearly double the share of any other streaming service on the market, is Spotify. With its game-\u00adchanging release in 2015 of Discover Weekly\u2014a generated playlist that tailors song selections to a user\u2019s listening habits\u2014Spotify presented personalization as the remedy to our overabundance of options.\u00a0 But in efficiently delivering what people seem to want, it effectively eliminated choice and removed humanity from the entire music listening\u2014and music discovery\u2014experience. According to a 2022 report published by Distribution Strategy Group, at least 30% of songs streamed on Spotify are recommended by AI. The success of Discover Weekly has since inspired mood-dependent playlists that change throughout the day and psychic readings based on people\u2019s listening habits. Other streaming platforms, like Apple Music and Amazon Music, have followed suit. All these takes on personalization share a common fault: The playlists too often resemble one another, filled with songs that offer different variants of the same sound.",
    "Glenn McDonald, a former engineer at Spotify and the self-described \u201cdata alchemist\u201d largely responsible for developing the company\u2019s encyclopedia of genres, believes that while accessing new music is technically easy, many of us don\u2019t do it\u2014mainly because we\u2019re not sure where to start looking. As we grow accustomed to the convenience of shuffling a generated playlist, we forget that discovering music is an active exercise.",

    "We expect too much from the algorithm For Spotify, McDonald says, personalization begins with breaking down songs via a data-intelligence platform that was known as the Echo Nest before the company acquired it. Through a combination of signal processing and human listening by musicologists, Spotify assigns roughly 10 different attributes to songs (e.g., key signature, danceability) before grouping them into libraries. AI-powered programs then pull from these buckets of sound to generate the personalized playlists, with parameters tailored to the habits of each user. How Spotify categorizes music determines what is made visible to us. It also shapes which niches artists fit into and how much exposure they get.\u00a0 McDonald sorts our listening habits into three concentric clusters: the stuff we listen to every day, the stuff that sounds like our stuff, and everything else we stumble upon. Spotify\u2019s auto-generated playlists mostly keep to the first bucket, occasionally venturing into the second. The third is accidental. The service never offers anything strictly different.\u00a0 Spotify thinks that even if we say we want to listen to something new, we always return to what\u2019s familiar, McDonald explains. He argues that in practice, slipping a reggae track into a playlist of \u201cbedroom pop\u201d (a genre that mainly features dreamy melodies and hushed vocals) often makes for an uncomfortable listening experience: \u201cIf you\u2019re given something new, it\u2019s odd, in the same way being teleported to random spots around the world for three minutes at a time would not be a pleasant tourism experience.\u201d\u00a0 To construct the 6,291 microgenres in its database, McDonald says, Spotify uses social data\u2014how listeners of the same artists sort those artists\u2019 songs and who else they listen to. He clarifies that Spotify\u2019s genres have no absolute boundaries but reflect a loose and dynamic consensus on how users listen to music. Small clusters of overlapping listening habits define these loose categories, while constant cross-pollination creates variations on them. \u201cEveryone understood where the center of the village was, and the further out you went, the more subjective it became,\u201d he says of the process as he remembers it. McDonald mapped this musical landscape on his personal site, Everynoise.com.\u00a0   As we grow accustomed to the convenience of shuffling a generated playlist, we forget that discovering music is an active exercise.  Our respective listening habits, when considered together, form a dynamic network that reveals how we collectively understand music. It\u2019s a shame that Spotify\u2019s current usage confines us to isolated algorithmic bubbles. Context and community Personalization, broadly speaking, has made navigating the internet\u2019s infinite pool of content incredibly convenient. We\u2019re served what we like, told what to buy, prompted on what to say. It\u2019s no surprise we expect our music streaming apps to do the same. However, employing algorithms to optimize music discovery requires explicitly defining what we want, and the problem is that what we want could easily be shaped by what we encounter. Asking an algorithm to broaden our horizons is like having lunch with a friend who claims to be open to anything but vetoes everything you suggest. \u201cCuriosity is an active mode,\u201d McDonald says. It\u2019s up to us to step outside our bubble.\u00a0 Music enthusiasts are creating new ways to reinvigorate this sense of curiosity, building everything from competitive recommendation leagues to interactive music maps. Before streaming, discovering music was work that brought a distinctly emotional reward. \u201cBack in college, I listened to whatever my friends were listening to,\u201d recalls Zack O\u2019Malley Greenburg, former senior music editor at Forbes. He describes exchanging CDs with friends, spending hours deciding which songs he liked and which he didn\u2019t. Later, acquiring new music became an exercise in sorting through audio files on thumb drives and (illegally) downloading MP3s from questionable websites. Sharing music was a much more personal, peer-to-peer exercise, and making a mixtape for a crush was a substantial labor of love. Automated recommendation systems have replaced this social culture of sharing music. The anonymous playlists we opt into today may be edited and even shared, but the emotional stakes are much lower.\u00a0 Because personally recommending songs revealed our taste, we had a vested interest in what we recommended. But the algorithm assumes no risk, simply offering what\u2019s mathematically sound.",
    "\u201cWhat I think is missing in music streaming is why someone thinks I should like a certain song,\u201d says Alex Keller, one of the cofounders of Music League, an online platform that allows people to submit songs to playlists that fit a certain theme. The platform has doubled its user base since last year, to roughly 130,000 monthly users.\u00a0 Related StoryThe complex math of counterfactuals could help Spotify pick your next favorite songA new kind of machine-learning model is set to improve automated decision making in finance, health care, ad targeting, and more.",
    "Music League has built this loyal community by gamifying the experience of recommending music. Users can join public leagues or create private ones with themes ranging from \u201cBest rap song\u201d to \u201cHorse crime.\u201d Each league hosts multiple rounds, where participants compete by submitting and voting for songs they think best fit a prompt. A big part of the experience, Keller says, is the conversation around each submission. He describes how his experience of each song changes as users are pushed to defend their choices.\u00a0 Unlike the myriad personalized Spotify playlists that instantaneously refresh on demand, leagues can be open for months at a time. There may be a long gap between receiving a prompt and submitting a song, or between listening and voting. People are encouraged not only to listen to songs from start to finish (an increasingly rare practice) but also to include liner notes alongside the songs they submit. Slowing down the process of music discovery can foster more purposeful listening.\u00a0 \u201cAs an adult, music is in the background in your life,\u201d Keller says. For him, the social focus of Music League puts it back in center stage. The collaborative recommendation process gives each song emotional weight and offers a refreshing departure from the streams of generated playlists we shuffle for ambience.\u00a0  Similar to Music League is a private Facebook community called Oddly Specific Playlists, a group that connects users from all corners of the internet with playlists inspired by (as the name suggests) very specific things. With over 364,000 members, the group is flooded with requests daily; users post pieces of inspiration and attach a brief explanation of their interest in the theme. Others share relevant songs and offer personal anecdotes to color their recommendations. Requests like \u201cStrong masculinity; healthy, not toxic; not misogynistic; bonus points for queerness\u201d beget discussion. What could strong masculinity sound like? What does a healthy song entail?\u00a0 Often, playlist requests have ventured into more somber subjects like heartbreak and grief. As users share deeply intimate stories about their relationships to specific songs, conversations develop and communities heal. The fact that members have likely never met can make the experience even more meaningful. Connecting with strangers around the world reveals the universality of even the most seemingly specific experiences and offers a unique form of validation. The discussions can also breathe new life into old songs; a request for songs prominently featuring the sound \u201coh,\u201d from a member whose two-year-old was obsessed with the letter O, spotlighted \u201cOh! Darling\u2019\u201d by the Beatles.\u00a0  Rather than challenging your tastes, algorithms only provide shuffled versions of what you already enjoy.  This focus on fostering organic human interaction is not new. Until 2017, Spotify actually had a chat feature, but it wasn\u2019t used widely enough (and didn\u2019t result in enough streams) to justify the resources required to maintain it. So instead, the company pivoted to optimizing personalization.\u00a0 While Spotify\u2019s platform evolved to make choosing music as easy as possible, the unpolished format of Oddly Specific Playlists has largely remained the same. Comments are still difficult to keep track of, and users must sift through mountains of posts to find relevantrecommendations. Despite the clunky experience, the community has been thriving since 2019.",
    "\u201cIf a social network is any good, then it has to have some actual people putting new content into the ecosystem and organizing it in a coherent way\u2014like someone making a hand-curated playlist,\u201d says Kyle Chayka, a New Yorker staff writer and author of Filterworld: How Algorithms Flatten Culture. That\u2019s just what the members of Oddly Specific Playlists do, even if the results can be hard to manage. In his book, Chayka recounts the many hours he\u2019s spent surfing music forums like AntsMarching.org and UFCK.org (fan sites dedicated to all things concerning the Dave Matthews Band and Pearl Jam, respectively), finding company with other posters who shared low-fidelity tapes from old concerts and fun facts about a band\u2019s formation. These cultural rabbit holes, to Chayka, offer a form of \u201cmutual learning\u201d that helps us better understand what we\u2019re consuming. If we know how an artist\u2019s signature style came to be, for example, we\u2019re more capable of intentionally shaping our tastes.",
    "Slowing down with curation\u00a0 In Filterworld, Chayka also outlines how algorithms have taken the place of magazine editors and museum curators as gatekeepers of culture. \u201cI think curation is a way to resist the flattening of the internet,\u201d he says, though acknowledging that the term itself has been watered down over the past decade.\u00a0 Chayka frames curation as intentional, arduous, and finite\u2014characteristics he deems antithetical to our relationship with algorithms. Where a curator voices perspectives that welcome discourse and discomfort, algorithms are written in fear of offending. \u201cWhen a human interprets a piece of art, it adds value rather than takes it away. An algorithm has no capacity to interpret,\u201d he adds.\u00a0\u00a0  Before streaming, a magazine profile on an emerging artist or a blogger\u2019s \u201cSongs I\u2019m listening to\u201d column would put musicians on your radar, inspiring deep dives into their discography. Music publications like Blender, NME, and The Source, also had great influence, the latter notably discovering The Notorious B.I.G. and highlighting him in its \u201cUnsigned Hype\u201d column. But, as Greenburg explains, \u201cstreaming services remove a step.\u201d Rather than challenging your tastes, algorithms only provide shuffled versions of what you already enjoy. Like the Soylent shakes popular in the mid-2010s for supposedly offering all the nutrients you need from a meal, these personal playlists may fulfill but can never satiate.\u00a0 In Filterworld, Chayka offers independent radio DJs as an antidote to the algorithmic takeover. The vaguely physical act of tuning into a radio station, like entering a concert hall, restores a tactile quality to our experience of music. When there\u2019s a voice behind the selection of songs, we\u2019re more likely to pay attention, Chayka insists. He describes how these DJs \u201cutilize all of their knowledge, expertise, and experience in order to determine what to show us and how to do it.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cWhen a human interprets a piece of art, it adds value rather than takes it away. An algorithm has no capacity to interpret.\u201d Kyle Chayka, the New Yorker The Hong Kong\u2013based musician known as Cehryl, who hosts the show Mystery Train on Eaton Radio, structures her shows around narratives. \u201cI think about my shows in the same way I think about a performance,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional arc.\u201d She puts her tastes first, hoping to express a unique point of view that will bring something new to her listeners.\u00a0 In a world of on-demand music, the real-time format of independent radio mandates a specific sequence of uninterrupted listening. Without skips, shuffles, or the ability to pause, it gives curators the opportunity to push their listeners\u2019 boundaries.",
    "Creating with \u201calgorithmic anxiety\u201d To Cehryl, a big part of being a musician today is grappling with the existential question of whether to make music for the algorithm. Since the popularization of streaming (and the rise of TikTok), the average length of a song has decreased from four minutes to roughly three. Artists are encouraged to put out singles or EPs instead of releasing concept albums. And in 2023, Spotify launched the Preview function, a TikTok-esque infinite-scroll music feed that showcases the \u201cbest\u201d few seconds of each song with every swipe. The algorithm rewards relevance and instant gratification. \u201cNo long songs. No patient, drawn-out songs. You want the hook by 15 seconds in, if not earlier,\u201d Cehryl says.\u00a0 Related StoryI Was There When: AI became the DJ Experiencing what Chayka calls \u201calgorithmic anxiety,\u201d Cehryl describes a need to feed the algorithm\u2019s perception of her: \u201cI have often been playlisted as bedroom pop. But I don\u2019t think I make bedroom pop.\u201d For artists, Spotify\u2019s genre breakdowns play a complicated role in their creative process.\u00a0 Spotify\u2019s algorithm offers loose categorizations to identify emerging genres or remodel familiar ones, but the platform\u2019s promotion of broader, more recognizable genres makes some artists feel pigeonholed and pressures others to conform. Fitting into Spotify\u2019s categories increases an artist\u2019s chances of going viral on the platform, even if each stream yields only $0.003 for the creator.\u00a0 Alex Antenna, who has created a website called Unchartify to offer a more manual way of navigating Spotify\u2019s database, attributes these pigeonholes to Spotify\u2019s push for personalization. He built his site to bypass the plethora of \u201cmade for you\u201d playlists and highlight lesser-known corners of Spotify\u2019s database.",
    "\u201cSpotify\u2019s music database has a very rich set of various parameters, markup, and categories to classify music in a very detailed way. This is simply not exposed in the official app,\u201d he says. He believes that even though it has a sophisticated way of sorting music, Spotify intentionally oversimplifies: Its library offers mainly personalized playlists drawing on broad categories like \u201cmetal\u201d or \u201cparty,\u201d many of which feature mostly \u201cpopular artists or songs you heard 1,000 times.\u201d\u00a0 Antenna points out that beyond genres such as bedroom pop or indie folk, Spotify offers a plethora of microgenres (such as \u201creminimal\u201d and \u201csky room\u201d) that are accessible only by name through its API. He hopes that by surfacing genres that more accurately represent an artist\u2019s sound, a system as granular as Unchartify can combat algorithmic anxiety.\u00a0 Unchartify reorganizes Spotify\u2019s database by sorting all genres into alphabetical order\u2014something unheard-of in today\u2019s world of engagement optimization\u2014and mapping them so that each album is a node connecting to a list of similar albums. Unlike Spotify\u2019s \u201cFans also like\u201d feature, which recommends similar artists without suggesting where their similarity lies, Unchartify offers a precise picture of where an album sits musically in relation to others.\u00a0 Unless specifically asked, Unchartify doesn\u2019t try to guess what you\u2019re looking for. Instead, it gives you the tools to surf Spotify\u2019s database systematically, as you might sift through archives in a public library. Antenna\u2019s position reveals an important source of tension in the world of on-demand music: Making the abundance of content online digestible requires simplification, but simplification often forgoes nuance.\u00a0 Beating the algorithm Going a step beyond Antenna\u2019s archaic decision to list genres alphabetically is Radiooooo, a self-described musical time machine that randomizes the discovery process by eliminating genre entirely.\u00a0 Founded in 2012 by a group of four DJs, Radiooooo curates a selection of songs for each decade dating back to the 1900s for each country across the globe. It prompts users to select music by time periods and geographic locations rather than genres or artists\u2014discarding any semblance of our current streaming experience and inspiring a new way of thinking about music. Radiooooo also tacks on a social component by crediting members who\u2019ve discovered the track, joining communities like Music League and Oddly Specific Playlists in encouraging a form of crowdsourced recommendation that invites conversation and disagreement\u2014a far cry from Spotify\u2019s vision of optimized, unimpeded listening.\u00a0 Perhaps the only way to escape our algorithmic bubbles is by building community. When we welcome diverse patterns of music consumption, we\u2019re challenged to consider music from different perspectives, the same way independent radio stations curate to tell a story rather than cater to a demographic. There\u2019s nothing to optimize in a community, and in turn, nothing to oversimplify.\u00a0 Despite functionally contradicting Spotify\u2019s philosophy, platforms like Radiooooo, Music League, Oddly Specific Playlists, and independent radio all complement the use of such platforms. They act as a springboard for our process of discovery, helping us step past Spotify\u2019s insistence on personalization by directing us where to look and, most important, making it fun.\u00a0 McDonald likens the functions of Spotify to Google Maps. \u201cGoogle Maps doesn\u2019t do the exploration for me, but it\u2019s helpful if I go somewhere,\u201d he says. Rather than taking us on guided tours, it provides the tools for us to navigate somewhere new. Much as it shows us what\u2019s nearby and how to get there, and flags notable landmarks others have visited, Spotify helps us access most music, lists global listening trends, and introduces us to artists similar to those we already know. But it\u2019s communities that help us home in on a destination Spotify can help us explore. Rage against the machine Four music discovery services to help you explore beyond Spotify's AI-generated playlists Music League is an online platform that allows users to submit songs that fit a certain theme.        Oddly Specific Playlists recommends-- you guessed it-- playlists inspired by oddly specific things. Unchartify provides a more manual navigation through Spotify's database. Radiooooo ditches genres altogether and prompts users to select music by time period and geographic location.
