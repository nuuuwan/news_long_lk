    "Japan\u2019s economy rebounds in Q2 on consumption jolt",
    "EconomyForecastingAsiaJapan",
    "A surprisingly strong rebound in private consumption in the second quarter of this year lifted Japan\u2019s economy out of a deep contraction in the previous quarter, as\u00a0real GDP increased by 0.8% sequentially in April-June. On\u00a0a year-on-year basis, the\u00a0economy was still 0.8% smaller in real terms than in the second quarter of\u00a02023.",
    "The recovery in private-sector spending bodes well for Japan\u2019s quest to dissipate an embedded deflationary mindset and spark a demand-driven growth cycle. The GDP data provide definitive proof that Japan does not face a recession risk; this is backed by recent data that showed real wage growth had returned to positive territory in June.",
    "The\u00a0decision in July\u00a0by the Bank of Japan (BOJ, the central bank) to\u00a0sanction the second increase in its policy rate this year (from -0.1% at the beginning of 2024 to 0.25% at present) indicates greater confidence in progress towards reflating the economy.\u00a0EIU\u00a0expects private consumption to grow consistently in the second half of this year, albeit at a more moderate pace, which in turn will underpin an upward economic\u00a0trajectory.",
    "Private consumption, which accounts for over half of GDP, registered its first growth in five quarters with a 1% expansion in April-June. Although inflation has remained sticky (the\u00a0headline consumer price index rose by an average of 2.7% over the same period), household spending was probably boosted by strengthening wage growth. Nominal wage growth accelerated over the quarter and outpaced consumer price inflation in June for the first time in two years. Household finances were also bolstered by a temporary \u00a540,000 (US$270) income-tax reduction as a part of the government\u2019s cost-of-living relief package.",
    "The\u00a0durability of real wage growth remains precarious, however. The\u00a0robust wage growth in June was flattered by one-off company bonuses, and the effect of income-tax reduction will wear off in the third quarter. Consequently,\u00a0we\u00a0do not expect consistently positive real wage growth until 2025, when inflation eases more\u00a0visibly.",
    "Growth was recorded across GDP components in April-June, which offers another positive sign for the rest of the year. Capital investment increased by 1.7% sequentially on the back of an upswing in private residential investment and resilient business spending on facilities and machinery. Export growth also picked up, and\u00a0we\u00a0expect accelerating growth in overseas orders in the second half of the year, as businesses restock\u00a0ahead of the year-end holiday season and potentially frontload to counteract the risk of higher US tariffs if the protectionist Donald Trump wins the US presidential election in\u00a0November.",
    "The data for April-June were slightly stronger than our forecast (sequential growth of 0.7%), largely because of the surprisingly strong private consumption. We\u00a0will retain our annual real GDP growth forecast of 0.5% for 2024, however, as\u00a0we expect domestic demand growth to moderate in the second half of the year, owing in part to sticky inflationary pressures. We\u00a0expect growth to accelerate to 1.1% in 2025 as inflation subsides and export performance improves.\u00a0This\u00a0relatively positive economic outlook forms the basis of our monetary policy view that the BOJ will be sufficiently confident to continue its monetary normalisation drive by lifting the policy rate to around 1% in\u00a02026.",
