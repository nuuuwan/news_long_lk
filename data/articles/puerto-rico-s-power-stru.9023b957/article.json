    "At first glance, it seems as if life teems around Carmen Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez\u2019s little teal-painted house in the municipality of Guayama, on Puerto Rico\u2019s southeastern coast. The edge of the Aguirre State Forest, home to manatees, reptiles, as many as 184 species of birds, and at least three types of mangrove trees, is just a few feet south of the property line. A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.  Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing\u2014a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico\u2019s ubiquitous coqu\u00ed frog. It\u2019s in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn\u2019t know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer. And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes\u2019 drive down the road is Puerto Rico\u2019s only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash. Advertisement The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile\u2014towering more than 12 stories high\u2014out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels.\u00a0  Governor Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n has signed a new law rolling back the island\u2019s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.  Between 1990 and 2000\u2014before the coal plant opened\u2014Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico\u2019s central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209\u2014a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the \u201coperation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company\u201d as \u201ca case of environmental injustice.\u201d",
    "Seemingly everyone Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who\u2019s sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air.\u00a0  When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation. \u201cIn one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,\u201d she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo\u2019s face was printed. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d  Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down\u2014as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical infrastructure.",

    "Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico\u2019s power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island.\u00a0  Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n serving as Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, America\u2019s largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico\u2019s lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island\u2019s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n issued an executive order fast-\u00adtracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants.\u00a0 In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for \u201cpractical fixes and emergency activities\u201d to improve the grid. It\u2019s all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico\u2019s grid before what\u2019s forecast to be a hotter-than-\u00adaverage summer\u2014and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory\u2019s elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards. Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory\u2019s state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement.",

KAUFMAN     At the same time, she\u2019s trying to enforce a separate contract with New Fortress Energy, the New York\u2013based natural-gas company that gained control of Puerto Rico\u2019s state-owned power plants in a hotly criticized privatization deal in 2023\u2014all while the company is pushing to build more gas-fired generating stations to increase the island\u2019s demand for liquefied natural gas. Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico\u2014despite the company\u2019s failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong. Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers\u2019 lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory\u2019s finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters\u2019 ability to steer their own fate.\u00a0 AES declined an interview with MIT Technology Review and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n responded to repeated requests for comment.\u00a0 \u201cI was born on Puerto Rico\u2019s Emancipation Day, but I\u2019m not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,\u201d says Alberto Col\u00f3n, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. \u201cI have sinus problems, and I\u2019m lucky.

    "El problema es la colonia What\u2019s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.\u00a0 The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad?\u00a0 The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt\u2014a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don\u2019t have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don\u2019t typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don\u2019t benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government\u2014the US federal government\u2014that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.  What\u2019s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.  A phrase that\u2019s ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: El problema es la colonia\u2014the problem is the colony.",
    "By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world\u2019s oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called \u201cthe white man\u2019s burden\u201d\u2014the duty to civilize his subjects. Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal had modernized the island\u2019s infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer\u2019s plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world. Advertisement But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island\u2019s middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico\u2019s territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the \u201cbelle of the bond markets.\u201d By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll.\u00a0 The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-\u00adowned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.

    "By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a \u201cpossession\u201d of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature\u2014in which the island\u2019s elected delegate had no vote\u2014to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act\u2014shortened to PROMESA, or \u201cpromise\u201d in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island\u2019s elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island\u2019s autonomy.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,\u201d Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the Harvard Law Review in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another \u201ccolonial experiment.\u201d \u201cThe democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected \u2018with all deliberate speed.\u2019\u201d",
    "Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-\u00addestroying electrical surges were distressingly common. The spotty service wasn\u2019t the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico\u2019s great blackout. The fiscal control board\u2014which critics pejoratively referred to as \u201cla junta,\u201d using a term typically reserved for Latin America\u2019s most notorious military dictatorships\u2014saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.",
    "In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy\u2014a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO\u2014to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy. A deadly diagnosis Until that point, life was looking up for Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue. \u201cThey were courting him,\u201d Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez says. \u201cHe was going to graduate with a great job.\u201d That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines. Advertisement So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo\u2019s case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash.\u00a0 Ewing\u2019s sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had\u2014extraskeletal Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone\u2014is even rarer.\u00a0 As a result, there\u2019s scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found \u201cno well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,\u201d researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to \u201csmall, retrospective, case-control studies.\u201d Dependable sun The push to give control over the territory\u2019s power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn\u2019t lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.",
    "But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island\u2019s residents. Last year, when the Biden administration\u2019s Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms.\u00a0  Nearly 160,000 households\u2014roughly 13% of the population\u2014have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 have enrolled in a pilot project aimed at providing backup power to the grid.GDA VIA AP IMAGES   With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico\u2019s energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply. In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board\u2019s lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created \u201ca precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.\u201d In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging \u201cthe importance of developing renewable energy projects.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It\u2019s disappointing, but that\u2019s why we weren\u2019t able to build large things.\u201d  But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.  The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau \u201cnegotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices\u201d on a handful of projects, says Javier R\u00faa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar & Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. \u201cThen the fiscal board\u2014in my opinion arbitrarily\u2014canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,\u201d he says. When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government\u2019s local experts will be final. \u201cThere\u2019s no trust,\u201d says R\u00faa-Jovet. \u201cThat creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It\u2019s disappointing, but that\u2019s why we weren\u2019t able to build large things.\u201d Advertisement That isn\u2019t to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing \u201cdeep structural inefficiencies\u201d that \u201cultimately delayed progress\u201d toward Puerto Rico\u2019s renewables goals. The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, R\u00faa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households\u2014roughly 13% of the population\u2014have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts\u2014eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage.\u00a0 Related StoryThe UK is done with coal.

    "The share of renewables on Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress\u2019s request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028. \u201cThere\u2019s been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,\u201d says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She\u2019d be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on \u201csmaller-\u00adscale natural-gas plants\u201d that could be used to back up renewables, but \u201cwhat they\u2019re talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.\u201d She says, \u201cThat\u2019s just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.\u201d What\u2019s more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn\u2019t require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana.  Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avil\u00e9s-R\u00edos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments.\u00a0\u201cImagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,\u201d she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. \u201cThe pollution impact alone would be horrible.\u201d  The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months\u2014but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they\u2019d pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.  \u201cThe government justifies extending coal plants because they say it\u2019s the cheapest form of energy.\u201d Aldwin Jos\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, 51, who lives across the street from Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico\u2019s contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden\u2019s senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the \u201ctroubling\u201d fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run\u2014disincentivizing any transition to alternatives. \u201cTerritories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-\u00adenergy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe.\u00a0That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build. Advertisement \u201cPuerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant\u2019s generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can\u2019t turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,\u201d R\u00faa-Jovet says. \u201cThat\u2019s just a physical fact.\u201d The lowest-cost energy, depending on who\u2019s paying the price The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island\u2019s bondholders. \u201cFrom a bondholder perspective, [it\u2019s] the lowest cost,\u201d she explains. \u201cFrom the client and user perspective, it\u2019s the lowest cost. It\u2019s always been the cheapest form of energy down there.\u201d\u00a0 The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant.\u00a0 \u201cThe government justifies extending coal plants because they say it\u2019s the cheapest form of energy,\u201d says Aldwin Jos\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, 51, who lives across the street from Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez. He says he\u2019s had cancer twice already. On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, \u201cthe government ends up paying the expense of people\u2019s asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.\u201d\u00a0 On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old.\u00a0\u201cSo many people have died,\u201d Su\u00e1rez V\u00e1zquez told me, choking back tears. \u201cThey contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black.

At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico\u2019s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico\u2019s central mountain range. \u201cCome to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,\u201d the group beckoned, \u201cwhere we have electricity and internet.\u201d\u00a0 Alexander C.
