Asoka Handagama's latest stage play, "A Death in an Antique Shop", is now available to watch on YouTube. This reflects the shift towards digital platforms and breaks from the traditional theatre setting. Watching a play on such a medium has many advantages like rewinding missed dialogues, watching at convenience and comfortable postures, lesser distractions, and leaving and rejoining the play midway. Handagama has incorporated characters from his previous work, Aksharaya, which was banned in theatre by objection from cultural police. The theme of the play explores the nuances of human life and behavior from a microcosmic perspective, showing human transformation during changing circumstances.
