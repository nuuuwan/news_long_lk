We are living through one of the most pivotal transitions in business history

Across decades of corporate leadership, I’ve witnessed many waves of change—but none quite like this. Artificial Intelligence, and more specifically Generative AI, is not simply the next trend in business; it’s the next transformation in how business itself is understood, built, and executed. We’re no longer competing for shelf space; we’re competing for mind space, and AI is rewriting how that space is captured. From subtle nudges in consumer behaviour to systems that learn, predict, and influence ahead of decision-making, the customer journey has already evolved. And so must we

After more than three decades in corporate leadership, often at the helm of transformational change across multinationals and local conglomerates, I’ve witnessed firsthand how businesses adapt, evolve, and at times resist the forces of external disruption. From economic shifts to digital revolutions, I’ve seen what reshapes markets and what merely passes through.

But nothing I’ve encountered compares to the scale and potential of what Artificial Intelligence now offers. Having begun my career as a programmer, the rise of AI rekindled a deep professional curiosity. This wasn’t just another innovation wave—it felt profoundly different. The more I observed, the more I realised: AI isn’t a technological upgrade. It’s a foundational shift that could redefine how we think, operate, compete, and lead in business.

That realisation prompted me to go deeper. I undertook specialised learning on data, AI and its influence through the University of Pennsylvania and followed it with an intensive program on AI and Management through Harvard Online. These experiences not only helped me understand the landscape of AI but also how its integration into core business processes is no longer optional—it is essential.

This article series is my attempt to share that journey. Not as a technologist, but as a corporate leader shaped by experience and driven by what lies ahead. It is about placing AI in the context of business reality—its opportunities, risks, and the urgent need for leadership to engage now, not later.

More than a trend: The structural transformation driven by AI

We are living through one of the most pivotal transitions in business history. Not due to another economic cycle, a shift in consumer behaviour, or a supply chain realignment, but because of technology. Specifically, the rise of general-purpose technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), and at its leading edge, Generative AI (GenAI).

For many business leaders, this moment is the wake-up call, particularly for those already connected to global markets or aspiring to be. Others may have a bit more runway depending on their industry or geography but make no mistake: it’s coming. It may arrive sooner or later, but it is unmistakably on the horizon.

This isn’t just another digital wave. It’s not about patching systems or automating back-office processes. This is a foundational shift—on par with the advent of electricity, the steam engine, or the internet. It will reshape how value is created, who captures it, and how fast disruption occurs.

John Chambers, founder and CEO of JC2 Ventures and former Chairman and CEO of Cisco Systems, was recently quoted in a McKinsey & Company article, drawing a powerful comparison between AI and the internet. He remarked that while AI shares many similarities with the internet, it is expected to evolve at five times the speed and deliver three times the impact.

The businesses that grasp this are already moving. The rest risk sleepwalking into irrelevance or below-par performance.

A morning with AI: The first three hours of my day

The day begins as my smart assistant, Alexa, gently wakes me up, greeting me with a cheerful “Good morning” before playing my favourite morning playlist. The moment I check my phone, I notice my spam filter has already sorted out a pile of junk emails, saving me the hassle of going through them.

Still in bed, I scroll through Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, catching up on my friends’ latest recipe videos. Just then, I stumbled upon an ad for a vacuum cleaner—ironically, the same one I had been considering for weeks. It feels like the internet is reading my mind. A few clicks later, it’s mine.

My iPhone unlocks with Face ID, seamlessly recognising me, and nudges me with a gentle reminder—it’s time for my morning walk. As I step out, my health tracking app offers some wellness tips, and the Nike app syncs up, ready to track my progress the moment I put on my shoes.

After a refreshing walk, I head back inside just in time for breakfast. Bixby, my Samsung TV assistant, senses my presence and switches on my favourite morning show. As I prepare to leave for work, I receive an urgent notification from my bank’s fraud detection bot—it’s flagging my vacuum cleaner purchase from earlier. A quick confirmation later, my transaction is cleared.

With everything set, my BYD (or Tesla for that matter) greets me, adjusting the seat, climate, and other settings exactly to my liking. As soon as I settle in, Spotify automatically picks up my mood, playing the perfect playlist. Then, right on cue, Siri chimes in—it’s 8 a.m., traffic is moderate, and the best route is already set in my navigation. And just like that, I’m off to work, powered by AI, without even thinking about it.

For me, most of this is true, meaning not in the same sequence but in terms of interactions, other than the BYD or Tesla, as I don’t drive one yet. But that’s the smaller part, which for me is taken over by the iPhone and Siri.

So, tell me if you still want to avoid AI or ignore its impact. An average person in developed countries interacts with AI around 5,000 times per day, as per the latest research. Now tell me whether AI is in your life or not?

Demystifying AI: What every business leader should know

Let’s begin with the basics. Despite how often the term is used, many of us still hold only a vague or oversimplified understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Sometimes, egos prevent us from admitting it. But it’s important to start with clarity.

At its core, AI is a system where data is processed through advanced algorithms to generate outcomes, solve problems, or make predictions, often across multiple possibilities. Think of it as pattern recognition and decision-making at scale.

Generative AI (Gen-AI), however, goes a step further. These algorithms aren’t just working off past data. They are trained to learn continuously from new and emerging data, allowing them to generate original content, ideas, or solutions, not just react, but create. They evolve with every interaction.

Combined, these technologies are capable of mimicking elements of human cognition — analysing, reasoning, and even “creating” — often producing results faster and more accurately than the human mind.

Winning early: How AI redefines the first moment of truth

The real danger or opportunity lies in what I call “mind capture.” It all depends on where you stand and how you choose to see it. Months before I even considered buying a vacuum cleaner, one particular brand had already planted a seed. Through personalised, intelligent content, tailored to my browsing behaviour, it kept reinforcing its presence. Frequent nudges, contextual messages, and subtle reminders ensured that by the time I was ready to make a decision, the brand had already won me over.

I didn’t actively compare. I didn’t look elsewhere. The brand had already secured mindshare long before the actual purchase moment. When the offer finally surfaced, the decision felt natural—inevitable even. That is the true power of AI: it allows firms to intercept the customer journey before the traditional marketer even enters the picture.

This kind of short-circuiting customer journey and pivoting through intelligent, AI-led engagement is what gives digital-first and Gen-AI-powered firms an edge. And it comes at a cost to those who still rely solely on footfall or traditional showroom-driven conversion.

To pre-emptively win the customer, before desire even forms, you must move beyond conventional marketing. The only path is a Gen-AI-driven, insight-rich digital journey that captures the mind before it captures the wallet.

Why this matters: Two signs of inevitable change

In my decades of working across both local and international markets, I’ve observed two powerful indicators that signal when a transformation is no longer optional, but critical. With my current vantage point in retail across the Asia-Pacific, these signs are clearer than ever.

nThe shift in the customer journey

When disruption places the customer at its centre, change becomes inevitable. Think of the early days of the internet—it wasn’t the concept that held it back, but access and speed. Today, those barriers are disappearing. The digital divide has narrowed. A consumer deep in the south is as informed as one in Colombo.

With Generative AI, we’re seeing a new layer—what I call “cognitive implants”—where brands influence customer thinking even before a need is formed. The customer journey now begins long before the search. Look at how Netflix or other OTT platforms have redefined how people consume entertainment. When customer behaviour pivots, the businesses that serve them must pivot too, or risk irrelevance.

nWhen it becomes a way of life

This wave is driven by general-purpose technology. Unlike earlier tech shifts, AI is embedding itself into our everyday habits, quietly but completely. From search engines to shopping, navigation to news feeds, its presence is constant.

Just the other night, my sleep app reminded me, despite a time zone change, that it was time to disconnect from my screen. That’s not just convenience; it’s integration. When technology becomes part of how we live, not just how we work, it doesn’t fade. It becomes the default.

A time to wake up, not warm up

Across decades of corporate leadership, I’ve witnessed many waves of change—but none quite like this. Artificial Intelligence, and more specifically Generative AI, is not simply the next trend in business; it’s the next transformation in how business itself is understood, built, and executed.

We’re no longer competing for shelf space; we’re competing for mind space, and AI is rewriting how that space is captured. From subtle nudges in consumer behaviour to systems that learn, predict, and influence ahead of decision-making, the customer journey has already evolved. And so must we.

This isn’t just about upgrading systems or enhancing productivity. It’s about recognising when a technology moves beyond function and becomes part of life as AI now is. When change embeds itself into how we think, choose, sleep, consume, and engage, it doesn’t pass. It becomes permanent.

Whether you lead a business, a team, or your career, the question isn’t if AI will affect your future. It’s whether you’ll actively shape that future or wait to be shaped by it. This series is not about hype. It’s about perspective, preparedness, and action. The wake-up call has already come. The smart ones are already moving.
