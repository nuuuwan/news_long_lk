    "How a brand acts in times of adversity speaks volumes about its brand personality",
    "As marketers, we were all recently exposed to a communication campaign by a popular tea brand in Sri Lanka that sparked significant discussion on social media, with certain audiences and factions deeming it controversial. This type of communication can be classified as brand activism \u2014 where a company publicly endorses or dismisses a social, political, environmental, or cultural issue \u2014 advocacy marketing, where a brand advocates beyond its product utilities or benefits \u2014 or the more recent term, woke advertising.",
    "In light of this subject being heavily discussed, we as marketers can use this as a platform for learning and explore how to establish insights for the future. This article will examine case studies of campaigns of this nature that have both succeeded and failed, noting key learnings we can build upon.",
    "Nike \u2013 \u201cDream Crazy\u201d (2018)",
    "One of the most notable campaigns, released in September 2018 by Nike, was the \u201cDream Crazy\u201d advert starring Colin Kaepernick, which addressed issues of racial injustice and protest in sport. Although this campaign was initially deemed unsuccessful and criticised by many, including Donald Trump \u2014 resulting in user-generated content of people burning their Nike shoes \u2014 it later gained traction as younger and progressive audiences began resonating with the ad. As these audiences built a strong affiliation with the brand, sales increased by 31%, while company stock rates rose by 5%. The ad went on to win an Emmy Award, proving its impact through initial resistance.",
    "The success of this campaign pivoted on how the brand\u2019s original, distinctive, and engaging brand values, together with its history of bold brand communications, paved the way for Nike to remain resilient when faced with adversity and criticism. This, in turn, resulted in a stronger bond and relationship between the brand and its stakeholders, including customers.",
    "Always \u2013 \u201c#LikeAGirl\u201d (2014)",
    "Another noteworthy campaign was #LikeAGirl by Always in 2014, which took on the challenge of battling gender stereotypes and promoting female empowerment. This campaign, which has also been categorised as \u201cfemvertising\u201d, managed to attain its objectives by gaining widespread traction and social acceptance. It succeeded because it addressed a concern applicable to everyone at some point in their lives, as the issue would have directly or indirectly impacted them. This campaign was easier for audiences to resonate with, as most had encountered the disadvantaged party at one point or another.",
    "Burger King \u2013 Women\u2019s Day Tweet (2021)",
    "In contrast, a campaign that went south was Burger King\u2019s Women\u2019s Day ad, which stated \u201cWomen belong in the kitchen\u201d as a hook to grab attention and create awareness that this wasn\u2019t actually the case. However, the brand faced major backlash as its Twitter post gained widespread criticism, leading the brand to apologise. The core objective and purpose of the campaign were not met, as the channels and audience experiences were not thoroughly thought through before execution.",
    "The learnings we can take forward are that brands that step into activism, advocacy, or woke advertising need to be authentic and aligned with their core brand values and history. Furthermore, cultural sensitivity is of utmost importance. It is necessary to highlight that, in discussing cultural sensitivity, a brand must also consider how pressing the issue is and how it resonates with and impacts the majority of the audience. Finally, while being connected to the brand\u2019s mission, if a brand decides to step into this bold territory, it must at all times be prepared to stand firm and ready for potential backlash, as how a brand acts in times of adversity speaks volumes about its brand personality.",
