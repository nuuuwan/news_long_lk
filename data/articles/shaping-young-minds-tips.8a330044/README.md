Learning materials should be accessible, child-sized, and in good condition—not merely

One of the most significant decisions facing parents in these months—and indeed with regularity—is choosing the right school for their child. Education plays a pivotal role in shaping your child beyond academics; it is also about their character, their skills, and their confidence. As such, it is essential to evaluate schools thoroughly based on various factors that contribute to a safe, nurturing, and effective learning environment.

This can feel overwhelming and daunting for many parents. Where does one even begin to think about the factors that will ensure their child is taken care of and supported to be the best person they can be? The following is an overview of some key considerations to examine and evaluate when selecting a school for your children.

Safety considerations

Safety should be a top priority when evaluating schools. Remember your child will be spending many hours each day in this space. For pre-and primary schools, for example, if there are water features, check if they are secured and if play equipment is challenging but safe. Sandpits should be clean and covered after use, and a turfed lawn and a garden spacious enough to accommodate the number of children are ideal to ensure fresh air. Learning materials should be accessible, child-sized, and in good condition—not merely for display purposes.

For any age, it is essential to ensure the entire property is enclosed by walls or fencing to prevent unauthorised access. Classrooms should be well-ventilated, with adequate floor space per child as stipulated by Sri Lankan authorities. Verify fire access points, the availability of a well-stocked first aid box, and policies for visitor management.

Teacher-student ratio

This is a vital aspect of consideration as the quality of education depends heavily on the teacher-student ratio and the qualifications of the teaching staff. For children aged 3 to 5 years, there should ideally be one teacher for every 10 children; for younger children aged 2 to 3 years, the ratio should be one teacher for every five children. When assessing pre-schools, consider if the teachers have been trained in preschool or Montessori methods and if trainees can provide additional support. Investigate how long the staff has worked at the school to evaluate stability.

Communication and school policies

Effective communication between parents and schools is key as it fosters trust and collaboration. Schools should provide regular updates on their child’s progress, and parents should have opportunities to participate in school activities and educational events designed for parental involvement. Consider whether the school engages in publicity—does it protect the children’s rights? Does the school have a policy on discipline and bullying? How are issues like this addressed and resolved?

Competitiveness and classroom activity

While extracurricular activities like concerts, sports meets, and graduation ceremonies are beneficial, excessive emphasis on these events can detract from learning. Assess how much time is spent rehearsing for events and whether the extra costs associated with these activities are reasonable. Ask questions that help you understand if rewards during sports meet or other activities promote healthy competition rather than undue pressure.

If you can observe classroom activity, note how the staff interacts with the children. How much time did you get to spend in the classroom? What activities are done outdoors? Check if children have access to outdoor spaces for environmental engagement. Look for designated areas like reading corners and inquire about the curriculum’s balance between indoor and outdoor activities. Observe whether children are engaged in collaborative work or independent exploration, particularly in the case of pre-schools. This is crucial. Teachers should assist only when necessary, allowing children to discover and learn independently. The classroom should exude peace while maintaining an energetic vibe. Staff should interact with children using gentle and soft voices.

School community and costs

A strong school community enhances social cohesion. Parents should be encouraged to socialise and collaborate on community development projects. Schools that promote trilingualism (Sinhala, Tamil, English) help children develop linguistic diversity and equal exposure to all religions and ethnicities, which fosters inclusivity. Consider whether convenience for parents compromises your child’s introduction to learning environments.

Cost transparency is vital; discuss upfront fees with the school administration. Avoid being swayed solely by social media promotions; recommendations from past students often provide reliable insights.

Finally, inquire about the history of the school. A well-established institution with a strong reputation often indicates stability in its educational practices. You can make an informed decision about your child’s education by carefully evaluating these factors—safety, teacher-student ratios, atmosphere, communication policies, competitiveness, community support, costs, and history. Some of the best evaluators of a school and its approaches are its past students; they can give you a bird’s eye view of the overall situation.

Remember that your choice will impact their academic success and their overall development as individuals within Sri Lanka’s diverse society.
