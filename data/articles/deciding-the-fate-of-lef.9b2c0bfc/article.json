To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been working on a piece about IVF embryos. The goal of in vitro fertilization is to create babies via a bit of lab work: Trigger the release of lots of eggs, introduce them to sperm in a lab, transfer one of the resulting embryos into a person\u2019s uterus, and cross your fingers for a healthy pregnancy. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But often it does. For the article, I explored what happens to the healthy embryos that are left over.

    "I spoke to Lisa Holligan, who had IVF in the UK around five years ago. Holligan donated her \u201cgenetically abnormal\u201d embryos for scientific research. But she still has one healthy embryo frozen in storage. And she doesn\u2019t know what to do with it. She\u2019s not the only one struggling with the decision. \u201cLeftover\u201d embryos are kept frozen in storage tanks, where they sit in little straws, invisible to the naked eye, their growth paused in a state of suspended animation. What happens next is down to personal choice\u2014but that choice can be limited by a complex web of laws and ethical and social factors.",
    "These days, responsible IVF clinics will always talk to people about the possibility of having leftover embryos before they begin treatment. Intended parents will sign a form indicating what they would like to happen to those embryos. Typically, that means deciding early on whether they might like any embryos they don\u2019t end up using to be destroyed or donated, either to someone else trying to conceive or for research. But it can be really difficult to make these decisions before you\u2019ve even started treatment. People seeking fertility treatment will usually have spent a long time trying to get pregnant. They are hoping for healthy embryos, and some can\u2019t imagine having any left over\u2014or how they might feel about them.",
    "For a lot of people, embryos are not just balls of cells. They hold the potential for life, after all. Some people see them as children, waiting to be born. Some even name their embryos, or call them their \u201cfreezer babies.\u201d Others see them as the product of a long, exhausting, and expensive IVF journey. Holligan says that she initially considered donating her embryo to another person, but her husband disagreed. He saw the embryo as their child and said he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with giving it up to another family. \u201cI started having these thoughts about a child coming to me when they\u2019re older, saying they\u2019ve had a terrible life, and [asking] \u2018Why didn\u2019t you have me?\u2019\u201d she told me.

    "Holligan lives in the UK, where you can store your embryos for up to 55 years. Destroying or donating them are also options. That\u2019s not the case in other countries. In Italy, for example, embryos cannot be destroyed or donated. Any that are frozen will remain that way forever, unless the law changes at some point. In the US, regulations vary by state. The patchwork of laws means that one state can bestow a legal status on embryos, giving them the same rights as children, while another might have no legislation in place at all.  No one knows for sure how many embryos are frozen in storage tanks, but the figure is thought to be somewhere between 1 million and 10 million in the US alone. Some of these embryos have been in storage for years or decades. In some cases, the intended parents have deliberately chosen this, opting to pay hundreds of dollars per year in fees. But in other cases, clinics have lost touch with their clients. Many of these former clients have stopped paying for the storage of their embryos, but without up-to-date consent forms, clinics can be reluctant to destroy them. What if the person comes back and wants to use those embryos after all? \u201cMost clinics, if they have any hesitation or doubt or question, will err on the side of holding on to those embryos and not discarding them,\u201d says Sigal Klipstein, a reproductive endocrinologist at InVia Fertility Center in Chicago, who also chairs the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \u201cBecause it\u2019s kind of like a one-way ticket.\u201d Klipstein thinks one of the reasons why some embryos end up \u201cabandoned\u201d in storage is that the people who created them can\u2019t bring themselves to destroy them. \u201cIt\u2019s just very emotionally difficult for someone who has wanted so much to have a family,\u201d she tells me.",
    "Klipstein says she regularly talks to her patients about what to do with leftover embryos. Even people who make the decision with confidence can change their minds, she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had those patients who have discarded embryos and then come back six months or a year later and said: \u2018Oh, I wish I had those embryos,\u2019\u201d she tells me. \u201cThose [embryos may have been] their best chance of pregnancy.\u201d Those who do want to discard their embryos have options. Often, the embryos will simply be exposed to air and then disposed of. But some clinics will also offer to transfer them at a time or place where a pregnancy is extremely unlikely to result. This \u201ccompassionate transfer,\u201d as it is known, might be viewed as a more \u201cnatural\u201d way to dispose of the embryo. But it\u2019s not for everyone. Holligan has experienced multiple miscarriages and wonders if a compassionate transfer might feel similar. She wonders if it might just end up \u201cputting [her] body and mind through unnecessary stress.\u201d Ultimately, for Holligan and many others in a similar position, the choice remains a difficult one. \u201cThese are \u2026 very desired embryos,\u201d says Klipstein. \u201cThe purpose of going through IVF was to create embryos to make babies. And [when people] have these embryos, and they\u2019ve completed their family plan, they\u2019re in a place they couldn\u2019t have imagined.\u201d  Now read the rest of The Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive Our relationship with embryos is unique, and a bit all over the place. That\u2019s partly because we can\u2019t agree on their moral status. Are they more akin to people or property, or something in between? Who should get to decide their fate? While we get to the bottom of these sticky questions, millions of embryos are stuck in suspended animation\u2014some of them indefinitely. It is estimated that over 12 million babies have been born through IVF. The development of the Nobel Prize\u2013winning technology behind the procedure relied on embryo research. Some worry that donating embryos for research can be onerous\u2014and that valuable embryos are being wasted as a result. Fertility rates around the world are dropping below the levels needed to maintain stable populations. But IVF can\u2019t save us from a looming fertility crisis. Gender equality and family-friendly policies are much more likely to prove helpful.\u00a0 Two years ago, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a legal decision that protected the right to abortion. Since then, abortion bans have been enacted in multiple states. But in November of last year, some states voted to extend and protect access to abortion, and voters in Missouri supported overturning the state's ban.",
    "Last year, a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that embryos count as children ignited fears over access to fertility treatments in a state that had already banned abortion. The move could also have implications for the development of technologies like artificial uteruses and synthetic embryos, my colleague Antonio Regalado wrote at the time. From around the web It\u2019s not just embryos that are frozen as part of fertility treatments. Eggs, sperm, and even ovarian and testicular tissue can be stored too. A man who had immature testicular tissue removed and frozen before undergoing chemotherapy as a child 16 years ago had the tissue reimplanted in a world first, according to the team at University Hospital Brussels that performed the procedure around a month ago. The tissue was placed into the man\u2019s testicle and scrotum, and scientists will wait a year before testing to see if he is successfully producing sperm. (UZ Brussel)",
