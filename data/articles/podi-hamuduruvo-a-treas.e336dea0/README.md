Most Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera passes away

Since his entry to The Order of Maha Sangha 60 years ago, the name of ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’ became a famous household term in Sri Lanka due to the gigantic missions he rendered to purify and strengthen an islandwide social fabric

It is not easy to summarise his vast and vivid sacrifices and services rendered to the nation; his life was not only exemplary but was as glamorous as the annual Gangarama Perehara (pageant) he invented for the world

The passing away of the beloved Buddhaputra Podi Hamuduruvo of the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Viharaya last Friday caused mournful shock waves among millions of Buddhist devotees and worldwide humanitarian activists. The late Most Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera was the Nawakorale Chief Sanga Nayake of the Shiyamopali Maha Nikaya of the Malwatta Chapter. Though popular as ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’, it is not easy to summarise his vast and vivid sacrifices and services rendered to the nation. His life was not only exemplary but was as glamorous as the annual Gangarama Perehara (pageant) he invented for the world.

Since his entry to The Order of Maha Sangha 60 years ago, the name of ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’ became a famous household term in Sri Lanka due to the gigantic missions he rendered to purify and strengthen an islandwide social fabric.

Galboda Kankanamage Don Karunaratne, born on December 14, 1943, hails from a farming family in a richly agricultural hamlet known as Galboda in the Kamburupitiya electorate. During his early years, Karunaratne attended Kapuduwa Vidyalaya in his native village. His parents were Galboda Kankanamage Don Maddumage Mahatmaya and Amarawickrama Liyanage Selehena Hamine. His family consists of two elder brothers and two younger sisters.

The young Karunaratne was initially garbed in shirt and trousers, being his school uniform. However, he preferred to be attired only in the national dress when attending Daham Pasala (Buddhist Sunday school to learn the Dharma). He was highly conscious and deeply interested in national and religious affairs. In 1948, when the nation celebrated its first independence day, Karunaratne was greatly inspired. His ideologies moved more towards Buddhist culture. As he always wished, he became fortunate to get his parents’ consent and cooperation to enter The Order of Maha Sangha.

Thus, on November 8, 1954, eleven-year-old Don Karunaratne was ordained as a Bhikkhu and became the youngest Samanera at Hunupitiya Gangarama Viharaya in Colombo. He was named Galboda Gnanissara Thera. His Guru Devas were Ven. Devundara Sri Vaccishwara and Ven. Devundara Sri Ratanajothi Theras.

Coincidentally, this auspicious day opened a new page in the history of the temple when Sri Jinaratana Bhikkhu Training Institute as well as the Gnanissara Pirivena were inaugurated simultaneously.

Before long, the new enterprising Samanera earned the respect and admiration of all those who patronised and acquainted with the Viharaya, becoming famous as ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’ (young monk).

In 1961, during a sea voyage to Malaysia, Gangarama Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Devundara Vaccishwara Thera became visually impaired and disabled until his demise in 1984. For 23 long years, ‘Loku Hamuduruvo’ (elder monk) remained ill.

As a loyal pupil, Podi Hamuduruvo who was just 18 years old volunteered to accept the challenges of the hour. Whilst being an undergraduate at Sri Jayewardenepura University, he solely undertook to nurse and care for his sick Guru Deva. Besides which, he was burdened with leadership responsibilities, religious programmes and maintenance duties of the temple. Vaccishwara (‘Loku Hamuduruvo’) who was pleased with his courageous pupil made him his successor as Viharadhipathi.

Gangarama Viharaya was built and gifted to Sri Sambuddha Sasana by religious benefactor Mudaliyar Don Bastian de Silva Gunawardana in the early 19th century.

In the past Gangarama Viharaya, with its splendid history had always provided shelter to many a scholarly and erudite Maha Sangha such as Ven. Ratmalane Sri Dharmarama, Waskaduwe Sri Subhuti, Weligama Sri Sumangala, Welivitiye Dhammaratne and Pundit Batuwantudawe.

At present, under the stewardship of Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera, Gangarama Viharaya is reputed as one of the most prestigious and beautiful temples in the island and is located by the Beira Lake. Temple complex includes an ancient “Sema Malaka” in the heart of the lake. This had been reconstructed by our ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’ according to modern techniques of renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa.

The Dagoba and sacred Bo-tree from the sapling of Jayasri Maha Bodhi, along with the Buddha’s sacred hair relic casket, are among the venerable fortunes. Its library and museum too are unique.

Ven. Gnanissara ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’, while attending to religious activities, had also implemented multi-faceted schemes to benefit and elevate the youth population as well as numerous underprivileged groups throughout the country.

In 1979, ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’ founded the Nawam Maha Perahera in Colombo. This glamorous cultural pageant has now become a great tourist attraction.

Besides, his untiring community services include an elder’s home which is operated by Gangaramaya Temple in Kataragama. The old age home is run primarily as a shelter for homeless people who have been abandoned by their families or have no support. In Kataragama and Kotte, he started orphanages which are open to children of all religions. The orphanages provide shelter, schooling and upbringing of children abandoned by their parents. Children with intellectual and physical disabilities are also accommodated there.

Galboda Gnanissara Thera established the Sumangala Daham Pasala and a preschool at Singithi Uyana. He has strictly emphasised sanitation and cleanliness programmes. He also spent money and donated toiletries and urinals to various monastic schools in Sri Lanka. In order to set an example and encourage sanitation and cleanliness, he has been spotted demonstrating sanitary welfare service.

Distinguished standards were reached mainly due to marvellous efforts and sacrifices exerted by Most Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera, our beloved Podi Hamuduruvo

In the field of vocational education, the Gangaramaya Temple provides gratis vocational training. Over 7,000 people attend classes daily and training for over 50 technical courses is imparted. Training is held at Sri Jinaratana Training Institute and some of the subjects are secretarial courses, English language, electronics, motor mechanism, bricolage (tinkering), painting, blacksmith, welding and electric wiring.

In appreciation of his benevolent services, the Malwatta Chapter Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha appointed him as Sangha Nayaka of Western Province. Meanwhile, the Asgiri Chapter bestowed on him with the honorary title ‘Dharshana Visharada’ (equivalent to a doctorate). He also briefly served as Sanghanayake of Sri Lanka Buddhist Temples in USA.

Today, Gangarama Viharaya serves not only as a place of Buddhist worship but also as a centre of learning. The temple is involved in Buddhist welfare service including elder’s homes, a vocational school and orphanages. The temple is uniquely attractive and tolerant to congregation members of many religions. It has also been instrumental in establishing the Buddhist Temple on Staten Island (US), the Buddhist Centre in New York and the Buddhist Centre in Tanzania, thereby helping to propagate Buddha Dhamma overseas.

‘Though popular as ‘Podi Hamuduruvo’, by word and deed he was an Iconic ‘Loku Hamuduruvo’ and a lighthouse to the nation may he attain the Supreme Bliss, Sadhu! Sadhu!!Sadhu!!!’
