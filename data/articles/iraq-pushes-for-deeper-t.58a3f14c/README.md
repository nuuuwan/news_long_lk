Iraq pushes for deeper ties with Europe

What’s happened?Following a two-day official visit to the UK in mid-January, the Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, signed a Partnership and Co-operation Agreement (PCA), setting out a medium-term framework for deeper co-operation in commercial, economic and strategic areas. For the Iraqi government, the framework agreement, which strengthens the local penetration of British companies in several major sectors, is part of a broader strategy of deepening ties with a range of European countries, leveraging security co-operation in return for stronger foreign investment inflows and trade relations, designed to boost Iraq’s non-oil growth prospects. We expect that Iraqi efforts to court European powers will help to bolster trade and investment inflows in 2025-29, although partnerships will remain limited in number, given Iraq’s small diplomatic reach and concerns among foreign investors about deeply entrenched operational and business risks in Iraq.Why does it matter?We expect the PCA to strengthen bilateral relations between the UK and Iraq over the course of our 2025-29 forecast period. For the UK, the signing of the framework agreement covers three priority issues, encompassing efforts to counteract illegal immigration, criminal networks and a resurgence of Islamic State resurgence. Among the many joint announcements and proposals included in the PCA are improved frameworks to identify and intercept people-smugglers, an overhauling of the bilateral visa system and a £800,000 package to train and support the Kurdistan Regional Government in disrupting organised crime. In return for these efforts on the migration front, Iraq is scheduled to benefit from a US$15bn export and investment package, composed of British-led projects across multiple sectors, including water, energy, pharmaceuticals and transport and logistics. In the medium term, we expect the PCA to provide a major boost to the penetration of the Iraqi market by British companies, which already have a strong presence in the sectors of banking (Standard Chartered), oil (BP, Shell), transport (Clayton Equipment) and services (EY, PwC).More broadly, the Iraqi government is accelerating efforts to capitalise on security concerns among European countries as a launch pad to strengthen diplomatic and economic relations. As the security situation in Iraq remains relatively stable, the government is looking diversify its commercial partnerships beyond a recent reliance on China, Iran and the US in order to progress with infrastructure and development projects. Iraq signed flagship Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreements with both Spain and Italy in 2024 designed to deepen trade and investment ties. Notably, the Spanish deal encompasses judicial co-operation in an effort to combat corruption.The multimodal Iraq Development Road (IDR) logistics corridor is likely to emerge as the focal point of closer Iraqi-European ties in 2025-29. The strategic importance of the IDR as an alternative route for Asia–Europe supply chains for prospective European partners has been heightened since 2023, following attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, which has led to substantial disruption in the critical maritime chokepoint, as well as the Suez Canal, at the northern end of the waterway. In November 2024 Iraq and Turkey entered into negotiations with Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria about their prospective co-operation on the project.What next?Ties between Iraq, the EU and individual European states are expected to strengthen during our forecast period, supporting progress on a number of critical infrastructure projects in Iraq and boosting the country’s otherwise flagging non-oil growth prospects. However, growing co-operation will remain limited to a handful of European countries, as ties with smaller nations remain fragmented: notably, several European powers lack diplomatic representation in Baghdad (Iraq’s capital), and Switzerland has only recently reopened its embassy, in September 2024. Without firm support from national governments, private-sector firms in Europe will mostly remain wary about investing in Iraq in 2025-29, given persistent concerns about insecurity, operational complexities and the country’s weak business environment. Meanwhile, competition from China is likely to grow rapidly in the medium term as Iraqi-Chinese ties strengthen markedly, and the country will emerge as Iraq’s top trade partner and main source of investment in critical sectors, including oil, transport, telecommunications and construction.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU’s Country Analysis service.
