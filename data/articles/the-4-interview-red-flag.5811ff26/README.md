If you’re being called in for interviews but don’t get the job, it’s possible that something you’re doing is raising red flags, causing the interviewer to question your suitability for the position. A recent survey found that the most concerning red flags range from obvious mistakes like lying, to more subtle slip-ups that job seekers might not even be aware of. The most concerning behavior from job candidates — by a significant margin — is dishonesty, with 63% of hiring managers saying they view it as the biggest red flag. Hiring managers see rude language or behavior as a red flag in potential hires. Despite your technical skills being strong, hiring managers are often also judging your interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. Criticizing or badmouthing previous employers is also a red flag with 62% of executives viewing badmouthing as a deal-breaker. Lastly, being unprepared can harm you in more ways than simply not knowing about the company’s background. For example, being inadequately prepared can cause some people to panic during interviews, leading them to overtalk and fill the silence with unnecessary details. Use these tips to support your interview preparation and have a better chance at getting an offer.

You applied for a new role and made it through to the interview process. You worked hard to prepare and put your best foot forward — but in the end, you didn’t get hired. Throughout your job search, this pattern keeps seeming to repeat itself. Now, you’re left wondering, “Why does this keep happening to me?”
