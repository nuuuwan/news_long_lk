    "(Veteran Journalist Sir Mark Tully Passed away on January 25th at the age of 90  in New Delhi.  This article written by Chandani Kirinde for the \u201cSunday Times\u201din 2003 is posted here as tribute to the legendary BBC Correspondent known widely  as the \u201cVoice of India)",
    "Sir Mark Tully is a believer in fate. It is fate, he says, that has led to his close ties with South Asia, particularly India where he has lived for nearly 40 years. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I am a foreigner here. I owe a great debt to the people of this region,\u201d says the veteran BBC journalist who is in Colombo to attend the Commonwealth Press Union (CPU) biennial conference.",
    "Being a full- time journalist for so many years meant Tully has been in the frontline of some of the biggest events that took place in South Asia in the past four decades. He recollects the Bangladesh war, the hanging of Pakistan\u2019s former leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the ethnic riots in Sri Lanka, the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi as some of the unforgettable stories he\u2019s reported on.",
    "He sees as positive the great economic progress that has been achieved by India as well as Sri Lanka but says that tragically, religion has been brought more into politics in India today. \u201cReligious intolerance is alien to the spirit of India as well as Sri Lanka. These countries have a proud tradition of tolerance,\u201d he says.",
    "Which is why he says he was horrified when he was in Colombo in 1983 during the ethnic riots. \u201cWhen I was here for the Non-Aligned Conference in 1976, it was such a peaceful place. But I am thrilled with the peace process and hope and pray it will succeed.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s been a long journey for Tully, one that ironically began in India itself. The year was 1935 when he was born in Calcutta, the legendary Indian city that continues to be a place he is especially fond of.",
    "His father was a businessman in Calcutta while his mother\u2019s side of the family had been \u201cBritish Indians\u201d who had lived there for at least three generations. His godfather after whom he was named, was Mark Carpenter Garner who incidentally was familiar as the Bishop of Colombo in those years. \u201cHe was a fine, pious man,\u201d Tully says of Garner.",
    "The first nine years of Tully\u2019s life were spent in India where he attended a special school that had been set up in the hill station of Darjeeling for children of foreigners. \u201cBecause of the war, there were no ships sailing out of India. So we stayed there till 1945. That year, we all moved to England except my father who stayed on because of his business,\u201d Tully recalls.",
    "He attended school in the southwest and southeast of London before at the age of 18 he was recruited to the army, a compulsory service at the time. But he describes his two-year tour of duty in Germany as being \u201cboring\u201d. \u201cThe war had ended by then. There was no excitement.\u201d",
    "When his military service ended, Tully went to Cambridge University where he studied history and theology for three years. \u201cAs I had studied theology, I wanted to be a priest. So I joined a seminary of the Church of England.\u201d Unfortunately, his fondness for beer meant the end of that career when the Bishop there very kindly told him, \u201cYou are more in place at a public house than a seminary.\u201d",
    "For the next four years from 1960 to \u201964, Tully worked for a private charity that provided housing for old people. It was after he resigned from this job along with several others over an administrative problem there that he managed to get a job at the British Broadcasting Corporation.",
    "His initial job was in the Personnel Department, which he did not like much. \u201cThose days if there were openings within the organization, we had to compete for them. So when a job was out on the board for an \u2018assistant representative\u2019 in Delhi, I applied and by my good fortune got it,\u201d he said.",
    "It was December 1964 when he set sail to India but the job was an administrative one, which he managed to turn into a broadcasting job. \u201cWhen you were with the BBC, you wanted to be in broadcasting and not anything else.\u201d",
    "Tully still recollects his first broadcast. \u201cIt was a short broadcast on the annual Statesman Vintage Car Rally in New Delhi.\u201d",
    "By 1969, the BBC had decided that Tully had enough experience to be the Editor of its Hindi, Bengali and Tamil language services. Today Tully\u2019s speech is lined occasionally with Hindi phrases. Does he speak fluent Hindi? \u201cChalta hai,\u201d (can manage), he says.",
    "From here Tully moved onto being the Chief Talks Writer on South Asia for the BBC World Service, as he wanted to do \u201cproper journalism\u201d. In 1969 he moved back to London and stayed on there till 1972 by which time his successor in Delhi had been asked to leave India. The BBC then decided they needed someone with enough experience in India and decided to send Tully back there.",
    "For India, 1975 was a watershed year when the government declared a state of emergency and the BBC decided to move out as it did not accept the censorship imposed on the media. Tully returned to London and worked in the newsroom. By 1977, the BBC decided to return to India and from there Tully worked for the station till he resigned in 1994. His resignation from the BBC itself was a high profile issue. \u201cI had made a speech attacking the new management of the BBC, and I felt I could not stay on as a member of an organization that I had criticized so strongly,\u201d he explains.",
    "Tully is still a British citizen and lives in India on a visa he renews every five years. These days he is working to get himself \u201ca person of Indian origin\u201d status. \u201cI have learnt a great deal from India. India has influenced my thoughts and I have learnt to respect fate.\u201d",
    "A regular churchgoer, Tully says he is dedicated to the idea that there is a God, a higher being. Will he ever leave India? \u201cBecause I am a believer in fate, I will not say I will never leave India. But I can categorically say I have no plans to leave India.\u201d",
    "Maybe it\u2019s fate that Tully has been living in the same house \u2013 an apartment at Nizamudeen in central Delhi \u2013 for the past 26 years. The place itself is historical. On one side stands the tomb of Moghul Emperor Humayan while across the road is the shrine of Hazrath Nizamudeen, a famous Sufi saint who is revered by his followers. It is only a 15 minute drive from the Indian Parliament.",
    "Since his resignation from BBC, Tully has been working as a freelance broadcaster, journalist and writer. He has written six books, three while he was with the BBC and three since his resignation. The books include Operation Blue Star, which he co-authored with a BBC colleage, Raj to Rajiv, which deals with 40 years since India\u2019s independence, No Full Stops in India, The Four Lives of Jesus, The Love of India, a collection of short stories and India in Slow Motion, his latest book which he co-authored. This last book deals with the need for India to dispense with its bureaucratic system of administration and modernize it.",
    "Besides his freelance writing and broadcasting work, Tully spends time with his dog and enjoys a beer in the evening with his friends. He also enjoys listening to music- classical, western and Indian. \u201cI know little about pop,\u201d he smiles.",
    "Does he miss the excitement of not being there to cover the big stories?",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve had a good run. Sometimes I miss it but I am glad I am away from it in a way.\u201d",
