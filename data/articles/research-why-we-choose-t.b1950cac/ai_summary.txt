We frequently continue engaging with unpleasant activities, even when there are more pleasurable and equally effective alternatives. This behavior is due to a phenomenon called "entrenchment," whereby repeating an activity makes us more likely to continue it, even ignoring better options.

This could even extend to organizations, to foster increased employee satisfaction and efficiency.
