It has been a year since the passing of Harry Jayawardena, one of Sri Lanka’s most formidable and influential business leaders. While he is no longer with us, his legacy continues to shape the private sector, inspire those who knew him, and set a benchmark for business leadership in the country.

Harry Jayawardena was more than a businessman; he was a visionary whose influence spanned multiple industries—from plantations and manufacturing to hospitality, finance, and infrastructure. His empire was vast, but what set him apart was not merely its size, but the hard-work, courage, grit, and clarity of thought he brought to every decision. In an environment where few dared to challenge his acumen, Harry’s voice stood out. He had the rare ability to speak truth to power, unafraid to highlight what was wrong and insist on accountability, earning respect even from competitors, governments, officials and regulators alike. Colleagues remember him as a leader with strategic foresight and a hands-on approach. He understood that true success required more than profits—it demanded strong institutions, determined leadership, and the cultivation of a dependable, loyal team. Many of Sri Lanka’s current corporate executives cite him as an enduring inspiration for their own approach to leadership, emphasising his insistence on excellence, transparency, and decisive decision-making. Even in his absence, Harry Jayawardena’s influence remains palpable. His children continue to manage the businesses he built, carrying the responsibility to ensure that his vision endures in the operations and growth of the companies he founded. Yet the most enduring part of his legacy lies not in balance sheets or boardroom reports, but in the standards and ethos he instilled across Sri Lanka’s private sector. His courage, grit, and resilience continue to resonate, guiding those who aspire to combine business success with principled leadership. As one observer aptly remarked, “The man is gone, but his mark, his promise, and his dominance in several sectors are unmatched.” Indeed, Harry’s influence is measured not only in his business achievements but in the culture of strong leadership, accountability, and excellence that he exemplified.

Harry’s legacy remains enduring. A year on, we remember Harry Jayawardena not simply as a business magnate, but as a visionary whose principles, insight, and impact will continue to inspire generations. May his memory guide and challenge his children running the business empire he built and all who follow in his footsteps. I like to end with his favourite saying: “It is better to light a candle in the darkness than to curse the darkness.”
