HBR’s top five most popular articles of 2024 (so far), present an opportunity to reflect on the work you’ve done in the preceding months, and chart any necessary course changes. The list includes a case study of how Starbucks lost its way (and how it could pivot); a guide to how to shift your leadership style based on situation; and a playbook for assessing the quality of the questions you ask at work.

The waning days of summer present a prime opportunity to step back and reflect on the paths you’ve taken so far this year, whether they’re personal or professional, and ask yourself: Am I growing in the right direction? What are my blind spots? Where could I be doing better?
