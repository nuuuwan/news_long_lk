Veteran Sri Lankan Tamil leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, who dedicated his political life to pursuing a just solution to the island nationâ€™s Tamil question, passed away in Colombo late on Sunday. He was 91.

Mr. Sampanthan, of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), was a sitting MP from the eastern Trincomalee district, and led the Tamil National Alliance,

the main grouping representing Tamils of Sri Lankaâ€™s war-hit north and east. He was Leader of the Opposition between 2015 and 2018.

A parliamentarian for nearly half a century, Mr. Sampanthan was a bold and relentless voice in the House. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, he tirelessly demanded equal rights for Tamils, within a â€˜united, undivided, indivisibleâ€™ country.

Trained as a lawyer, he based his arguments for a political solution on Sri Lankaâ€™s constitutional history and the many promises that the southern Sinhalese establishment made in the past but failed to keep.
