Uncertain global outlook threatens fiscal consolidation in El Salvador

What’s happened?In late March the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a US$500m loan to support El Salvador’s fiscal adjustment efforts. The disbursement largely reflects adherence to budget targets, highlighting the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation despite ongoing tensions with the IMF over its Bitcoin policy. The government of the president, Nayib Bukele, has continued to purchase Bitcoin for reserve accumulation—an approach that diverges from IMF guidance and introduces additional policy uncertainty. Nonetheless, fiscal tightening remains a clear priority. As in much of Latin America, a major risk to the outlook now stems from uncertainty over US trade policy, given El Salvador’s deep trade and investment links with the US.Why does it matter?Although the budget deficit has narrowed in recent months and the Bukele administration does appear to be committed to meeting its fiscal targets, the envisaged consolidation path could stall if external conditions deteriorate further—particularly in the event of a deeper than expected US recession this year. The Bukele government aims to achieve a balanced budget in 2025 and deliver a cumulative fiscal adjustment of 3.5% of GDP by 2027, in line with IMF expectations. The strategy centres primarily on wage and hiring freezes in the public sector, alongside plans to broaden the tax base and expand digital invoicing from 2026.However, spending patterns are mixed. Budget allocations for the presidency, defence and public security have increased substantially—defence spending alone is set to rise by about 20% this year, reflecting Mr Bukele’s emphasis on security policy, which is a cornerstone of his high approval ratings. At the same time, the return of undocumented migrants from the US will place additional strain on the public finances by increasing demand for social welfare services. Although El Salvador reportedly received US$6m from the US for accepting hundreds of Venezuelan deportees with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua (a Venezuelan criminal gang), this level of support is unlikely to fully offset the broader fiscal costs of accommodating both deported (Salvadoran and non-Salvadoran) criminals and non-criminal migrants.The major question is whether spending cuts in other areas and planned revenue-raising measures will be sufficient to meet the 3.5% of GDP fiscal adjustment target in the medium term. Weak domestic demand poses a challenge, as do the ripple effects of sweeping US tariffs. Although the US president, Donald Trump, announced a 90-day pause in April on the roll-out of reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, a 10% blanket rate on Salvadoran goods remains in place. Although Mr Bukele may seek exemptions, given his close relationship with Mr Trump, we expect the broader trade conflict to ultimately dampen US import demand and weigh on El Salvador’s exports regardless.What next?Despite global headwinds, the government remains well positioned to achieve its primary budget deficit target of zero for 2025, supported by Mr Bukele’s commanding legislative majority, which will enable the swift passage of cost-cutting measures that would otherwise be difficult to implement without strong congressional backing. However, the risk of fiscal slippage is increasing. An expected US recession this year will weigh on El Salvador’s GDP growth and constrain revenue collection. At the same time, the continued ring-fencing of security will limit fiscal flexibility in other areas. Even if a balanced budget is achieved in the near term, meeting the full 3.5% of GDP fiscal adjustment target by 2027 will become increasingly difficult if external conditions remain unfavourable. This will create uncertainty around the government’s ability to comply fully with its IMF commitments, sustaining investor anxiety in the meantime.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU’s Country Analysis service.
