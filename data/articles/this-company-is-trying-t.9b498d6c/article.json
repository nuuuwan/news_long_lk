    "It probably hasn\u2019t been long since you last slipped into something stretchy. From yoga pants to socks, stretch fabrics are everywhere. And they\u2019re only getting more popular: The global spandex market, valued at almost $8 billion in December 2024, is projected to grow between 2% and 8% every year over the next decade. That might be better news for your comfort than for the environment. Most stretch fabrics contain petroleum-based fibers that shed microplastics and take centuries to decompose. And even a small amount of plastic-based stretch fiber in a natural garment can render it nonrecyclable. Alexis Pe\u00f1a and Lauren Blake, cofounders of Good Fibes, aim to tackle this problem with lab-grown elastics. Operating out of Tufts University and Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, they are using a class of materials called silk elastin-like proteins (SELPs) to create biodegradable textiles.

New ingredients and manufacturing methods could help clean up the industry.",
    "\u201cTrue circularity has to start with raw materials,\u201d says Pe\u00f1a. \u201cWe talk about circularity across many industries, but for textiles, we must address what we\u2019re using at the source.\u201d Engineered from recombinant DNA, SELPs are copycat proteins inspired by silk and elastin that can be customized for qualities like tensile strength, dye affinity, and elasticity. Silk\u2019s amino acid sequences\u2014like glycine-alanine and glycine-serine\u2014give fibers strength, while elastin\u2019s molecular structure adds stretchiness. Combine these molecules like Lego blocks, and voil\u00e0!\u2014at least theoretically, you have the ideal flexible fiber.",
    "An early-stage startup, Good Fibes creates its elastics with proteins from E. coli, a common bacterium. The process involves transforming the proteins into a gel-like material, which can then be made into fibers through wet-spinning. These fibers are then processed into nonwoven textiles or threads and yarns to make woven fabrics. Scaling, however, remains a challenge: To produce a single swatch of test fabric, Blake says, she needs at least one kilogram (approximately two pounds) of microbial material. The fibers must also be stretchy, durable, and resistant to moisture in all the right proportions. \u201cWe\u2019re still solving these issues using various chemical additions,\u201d she says. For that reason, she\u2019s also experimenting with plant-based proteins like wheat gluten, which she says is available in larger quantities than bacteria.",
    "Timothy McGee, a biomaterials expert at the research lab Speculative Technologies, says manufacturing is the biggest hurdle for biotextile startups. \u201cMany labs and startups around the world successfully create recombinant proteins with amazing qualities, but they often struggle to turn those proteins into usable fibers,\u201d he says.

    "One Japanese biomaterials company, Spiber, opened a commercial facility in 2022 to produce textiles from recombinant E. coli proteins using a fermentation process the company first developed in 2007. The following year\u2014after 16 years of prototyping\u2014The North Face, Goldwin, Nanamica, and Woolrich became the first mass-market brands to sell garments using Spiber\u2019s protein-based textiles. Good Fibes wants to do the same thing, but for stretchy fabrics. The company recently began experimenting with non\u00adwoven versions of its textiles after Pe\u00f1a received a $200,000 US Department of Energy grant in 2024. The most popular nonwoven materials are those used in paperlike products, such as surgical masks and paper towels, but Pe\u00f1a envisions a softer, stretchier version that\u2019s almost more like a lightweight felt. She used the grant to buy the company\u2019s first 3D bioprinter, which arrived in January. With it, she\u2019ll begin patterning nonwoven swatches.\u00a0 If it\u2019s successful, McGee predicts, a nonwoven stretch fabric could be a more scalable option than wovens. But he adds: \u201cNonwovens are not very structural, so they\u2019re usually not very tough. The challenge [Good Fibes] will need to show is what level of strength and toughness\u2014at what size and scale\u2014can they produce, and at what cost?\u201d With additional funding, Pe\u00f1a and Blake plan to develop both woven and nonwoven textiles moving forward.\u00a0 Meanwhile, they\u2019ve already forged relationships with at least one major athletic apparel retailer eager to test their future fabric samples. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018When you get a swatch, send it to us!\u2019\u201d Blake says, adding that she believes Good Fibes will be ready to commercialize in two years. Until then, their fashion innovation will continue taking shape in the lab. As Blake puts it: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking big by thinking small\u2014down to the molecular level.\u201d\u00a0 Megan DeMatteo is a journalist based in New York City.\u00a0 hide"
