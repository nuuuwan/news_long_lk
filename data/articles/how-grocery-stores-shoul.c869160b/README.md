During 2020-21 online grocery shopping soared from 3.4% to double digits as Covid-19 made customers reluctant to go into stores. Post Covid, online grocery shopping is still high, forecasted by Forrester (2021) to hit 10.4% in 2024. How will grocery retailers...more

Grocery retailers face a challenge: What to do with the online channel, which is growing and popular with a segment of their customers but is hugely unprofitable? Based on research we have conducted in the last three years, we offer three other options in this article.

A Popular and Growing Channel

Over two decades have passed since Webvan pioneered the online grocery domain. Since then, countless ventures have emerged in hopes of capitalizing on this digital market. Despite these efforts,  online grocery sales in 2019 stood at just 3.4% of total sales, the lowest of 31 segments tracked by CBRE.

Of course, the Covid-19 pandemic changed all of that. U.S. Census Bureau data shows total online sales over all retail segments growing steadily from 6% in 2013 to 12% in the first quarter of 2020. Then, just three months later, in the second quarter of 2020, the online share surged to 18%, and much of that growth was in grocery.

But as grocers discovered, vastly more labor is required in the online channel. An unpublished industrial engineering study we conducted that tracked labor from the point a retailer procures a product at its distribution center to the moment it lands in the hands of a customer showed that as much as 125% more labor is required by the online channel versus the traditional mode where customers shop the store and go through checkout at a cashier. These results are no surprise if one thinks of the double-handling involved in paying workers to move product through the supply chain and onto store shelves and then paying a different set of workers to move the product off the store shelves, bundle it, and deliver to customers.

So today grocery retailers face a challenge: What to do with the online channel, which is growing and popular with a segment of their customers but is hugely unprofitable? Two years ago, we embarked on a comprehensive study aimed at delving deeply into this challenge. We engaged in insightful conversations with 15 senior grocery retail managers spanning 10 countries. These discussions not only painted a vivid picture of the state of grocery retailing but also informed the creation of a detailed survey which was administered to a curated group of 60 grocery retail executives in the 10 countries.

An Unsustainable Approach

Our findings: Grocery retailers, irrespective of geography, were grappling with the trifecta of staffing shortages, wavering employee retention, and escalating wage bills. They said that finding labor is moderately to extremely difficult 50% of the time, and in five years, they projected that number to grow to 69%.

However, despite the labor challenges, these grocery retailers were doubling down on the more-labor-intensive online grocery service, a model which, at best, offers slimmer profit margins and, at worst, treads into unprofitable terrains. The respondents expected their online business to grow from an already high 17% to 24% in five years.

To better understand the labor challenge, this year we teamed up with West Monroe Partners, an IT consulting firm, to assess labor requirements for four different delivery modes for a typical online order of 20 units across 15 SKUs. The requirements were tracked at three to six locations for each of the four modes. We estimated that the labor required from the point a procured product arrives at a retailer’s distribution center to the moment it lands in the hands of a customer. The base case in our model was the traditional mode: customers shop at the stores, pay for their purchases at a cashier, and bring them home. The table below shows the incremental labor minutes required for four delivery modes relative to this base case, which requires 30 minutes of retailer labor. (You can use this website to play with our industrial engineering model to estimate labor required to pick up online orders under different approaches and orders characteristics.)

Given that wage rates grew 8% in 2020 and are now increasing 4.2% annually, it’s clear grocery retailers face a significant challenge.

What intrigued us was the discrepancy between the labor required and the observed charges associated with online grocery services. While retailers often charge customers for delivery, they rarely factor in the additional labor involved in preparing orders for pickup or delivery. A “buy online, pick up curbside” order that is gathered from the store’s sales floor requires 32.6 minutes of labor more than the 30 minutes in the base case, more than double the labor required for in-store shopping, yet retailers frequently offer this service free of charge. Equally perplexing is the fact that there are no noticeable price differences between products the consumers buy in the store and those they purchase online.

Traditional in-store customers, who still compose the vast majority of the customer base, are effectively subsidizing online grocery services. Online shoppers enjoy the convenience of ordering groceries and having them delivered, but they are not being charged for the additional labor and resources required to fulfill their orders.

Three Options for Grocery Retailers

One thing retailers cannot continue doing is the common model of free order picking and curbside delivery. It’s doubtful retailers make any profit under this model. We see three distinct alternative ways forward, each of which can work for certain customer segments. The choice will depend on the characteristics of the retailer and its current business model.

1. Double down on the traditional in-store model.

Trader Joe’s exemplifies this model, as its website clearly explains: “At this time, we don’t sell any products (gift cards included) online, only in our brick-and-mortar stores. We do not offer curbside pickup or delivery, and we don’t work with third party delivery services like Instacart or Dumpling because they can’t match our outstanding in-store value and shopping experience. We set up our stores with care, finding just the right Crew and creating a rewarding shopping experience, full of discovery, and welcome. After considering the options, we’re still just big ‘ole fans of the neighborhood grocery store where we can say hello when you’re looking around wondering — “what’s for dinner?”

For some customers, this response might be disappointing. However, in taking this stand, Trader Joe’s is recognizing that it cannot be everything for everyone. It is a thoughtful response of a grocery retailer that has considered the options and concluded that everyone, customers and retailers, will be better off without it offering online service.

2. Make online customers pay extra.

Offer online services to those customers who are willing to pay extra for the convenience in the form of either service charges or higher product prices. Adjusting the prices in this way can help retailers cover the costs of online operations while also encouraging in-store shopping, which contributes a significant portion of their revenues. Wegmans and Aldi have pursued this path.

Wegmans uses Instacart to service online customers, with both store pickup and delivery available. Instacart covers its costs by charging, on average, 15% higher product prices. For example, someone who buys a pint of blueberries in its store in King of Prussia, Pennsylvanian pays $4.99, while someone who buys it via the Instacart service pays $5.19, and a dozen eggs costs $4.79 in store versus $5.59 via Instacart.

3. Become more efficient at online.

Walmart has been pursuing this path via what it calls Market Fulfillment Centers (MFCs). These are fulfillment centers colocated with a hub store in a major city that assembles customer orders for curbside pickup. The business case for MFCs is that curbside pickup at a fulfillment center requires just 0.7 minutes more labor than in-store shopping does. Through automation and scale economies, Walmart is seeking to enhance the efficiency of this mode still further.

So far, it has opened two MFCs — one in Bentonville, Arkansas, and the other in Salem, New Hampshire — with many more to come.

The choices made by Trader Joe’s, Wegmans, and Walmart are instructive for other grocery retailers as they formulate an online strategy. Trader Joe’s is known for its excellent in-store shopping experience and easy-to-find, helpful store associates, which enables it to “just say no” to offering an online option. Also, its stores are a bit small, so adding an army of online shoppers to the mix would erode the in-store experience.

The advantages of the Wegmans approach is that it covers the higher cost of its online service (via 15% higher product prices) and is easy to implement (given that it outsources the service to Instacart). Also, its stores are large and can handle the extra traffic of Instacart shoppers (the people who pick the items in stores for Instacart customers). We can see this approach making sense for many grocery retailers.

Walmart is known for being good at store operations and technology but not known for providing a great in-store shopping experience. Thus, its approach of using its technical skills to provide free online shopping makes sense in that it transfers some customer demand from stores to online.

What grocery retailers should not do is continue to lose money on online orders by picking them for free. If you have a compelling in store experience, consider Trader Joe’s approach. If you have or can create world-class fulfillment capabilities, perhaps assisted by some automation, consider the Walmart approach. Otherwise, the Wegman’s approach has the advantage of being minimally disruptive because you hire others to do the heavy lifting and charge customers to cover their costs.
