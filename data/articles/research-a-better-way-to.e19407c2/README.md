As remote work continues to grow in the U.S., employers are increasingly adopting new technologies to monitor how their employees spend their time. The research on the utility of these monitoring tools has been mixed: Some studies show that they boost performance whereas others suggest they increase deviant behavior and erode trust. In a new study, researchers explored the impact that different kinds of monitoring have on employees’ willingness to share new ideas. They found that “interactional monitoring,” characterized by regular, discussion-based check-ins, can encourage innovation while passive “observational monitoring,” often powered by technological surveillance, makes employees less likely to speak up. This is particularly true of workers in complex jobs like software engineering, product design, or strategy consulting, who are three times less likely to share new ideas if they are experiencing observational monitoring. The researchers offer considerations for companies looking to encourage creativity without weakening employee trust.

Despite recent calls from public- and private-sector companies to return to the office, remote work continues to reshape the modern workplace. By the end of 2025, 36.2 million Americans, or 14% of the U.S. adult population, are expected to work from home, an increase from the 22.5 million Americans reported to have worked primarily from home in 2023. Organizations continue to wrestle with how to monitor out-of-sight employees’ performance.
