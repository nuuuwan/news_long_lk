    "We got two big pieces of energy news from Google this week. The company announced that it\u2019s signed an agreement to purchase electricity from a fusion company\u2019s forthcoming first power plant. Google also released its latest environmental report, which shows that its energy use from data centers has doubled since 2020. Taken together, these two bits of news offer a fascinating look at just how desperately big tech companies are hunting for clean electricity to power their data centers as energy demand and emissions balloon in the age of AI. Of course, we don\u2019t know exactly how much of this pollution is attributable to AI because Google doesn\u2019t break that out. (Also a problem!) So, what\u2019s next and what does this all mean?\u00a0 Related StoryInside a fusion energy facilityCommonwealth Fusion Systems is trying to bring a long-promised technology to reality.",
    "Let\u2019s start with fusion: Google\u2019s deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems is intended to provide the tech giant with 200 megawatts of power. This will come from Commonwealth\u2019s first commercial plant, a facility planned for Virginia that the company refers to as the Arc power plant. The agreement represents half its capacity. What\u2019s important to note here is that this power plant doesn\u2019t exist yet. In fact, Commonwealth still needs to get its Sparc demonstration reactor, located outside Boston, up and running. That site, which I visited in the fall, should be completed in 2026.",
    "(An aside: This isn\u2019t the first deal between Big Tech and a fusion company. Microsoft signed an agreement with Helion a couple of years ago to buy 50 megawatts of power from a planned power plant, scheduled to come online in 2028. Experts expressed skepticism in the wake of that deal, as my colleague James Temple reported.) Nonetheless, Google\u2019s announcement is a big moment for fusion, in part because of the size of the commitment and also because Commonwealth, a spinout company from MIT\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is seen by many in the industry as a likely candidate to be the first to get a commercial plant off the ground. (MIT Technology Review is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)",
    "Google leadership was very up-front about the length of the timeline. \u201cWe would certainly put this in the long-term category,\u201d said Michael Terrell, Google\u2019s head of advanced energy, in a press call about the deal. The news of Google\u2019s foray into fusion comes just days after the tech giant\u2019s release of its latest environmental report. While the company highlighted some wins, some of the numbers in this report are eye-catching, and not in a positive way. Google\u2019s emissions have increased by over 50% since 2019, rising 6% in the last year alone. That\u2019s decidedly the wrong direction for a company that\u2019s set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade. It\u2019s true that the company has committed billions to clean energy projects, including big investments in next-generation technologies like advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal systems. Those deals have helped dampen emissions growth, but it\u2019s an arguably impossible task to keep up with the energy demand the company is seeing. Google\u2019s electricity consumption from data centers was up 27% from the year before. It\u2019s doubled since 2020, reaching over 30 terawatt-hours. That\u2019s nearly the annual electricity consumption from the entire country of Ireland. As an outsider, it\u2019s tempting to point the finger at AI, since that technology has crashed into the mainstream and percolated into every corner of Google\u2019s products and business. And yet the report downplays the role of AI. Here\u2019s one bit that struck me: \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to note that our growing electricity needs aren\u2019t solely driven by AI. The accelerating growth of Google Cloud, continued investments in Search, the expanding reach of YouTube, and more, have also contributed to this overall growth.\u201d There is enough wiggle room in that statement to drive a large electric truck through. When I asked about the relative contributions here, company representative Mara Harris said via email that they don\u2019t break out what portion comes from AI. When I followed up asking if the company didn\u2019t have this information or just wouldn\u2019t share it, she said she\u2019d check but didn\u2019t get back to me.",
    "I\u2019ll make the point here that we\u2019ve made before, including in our recent package on AI and energy: Big companies should be disclosing more about the energy demands of AI. We shouldn\u2019t be guessing at this technology\u2019s effects. Google has put a ton of effort and resources into setting and chasing ambitious climate goals. But as its energy needs and those of the rest of the industry continue to explode, it\u2019s obvious that this problem is getting tougher, and it\u2019s also clear that more transparency is a crucial part of the way forward.
