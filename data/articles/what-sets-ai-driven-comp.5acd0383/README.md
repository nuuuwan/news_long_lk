Companies that are driven by generative AI operate differently in the following three ways: they prioritize using AI to address customer problems, they break down functional silos and involve employees in problem solving, and they use AI to improve customer...more

In the age of AI, companies are dividing into the “haves” and “have nots,” with the majority in the latter camp. A recent BCG study found that only 10% of companies have mastered scaling gen AI. But this is not their workers’ fault. In fact, a recent BCG consumer sentiment survey found that 70% of workers are enthusiastic about the use of gen AI in the workplace. Workers appreciate the ability to accelerate their learning as well as reduce the toil in their everyday jobs. But as companies move on from bottom-up uses of gen AI, in which individual workers apply it to their own tasks, and onto redesigning whole processes for AI, anxieties go up. In particular, fears of job displacement become more and more of a concern.

It doesn’t have to be that way. Leaders can accelerate their AI impact by engaging their workforce and using it to help them grow. In our research, and book, Personalized: Customer Strategy in the Age of AI, we found AI-driven companies simply operate differently in three specific ways:

They embed AI in their strategic priorities. AI-driven companies take a portfolio approach and prioritize areas where they can gain competitive advantage from responsible AI bets. They look at real customer problems they can solve and point their bigger investments at creating new value.

They break down functional silos and get employees very involved in shaping solutions. These companies realize that business, finance, analytics, operations and regulatory teams need to work together to scale AI. They also understand that small, nimble teams are required to get things done and eliminate bureaucracy.

They use AI to improve the experience, instead of just focusing on boosting efficiency. They realize that workers at all levels will be much more willing to embrace AI if it results in happier customers and their own employee experience getting better.

Prioritize Using AI to Address Customer Problems

Boards, C-suites, and leadership all have a huge roles to play in these efforts. For example, a large consumer products company embedded an AI perspective into each step of their strategic planning process, forcing tough discussions and trade-offs on where to invest to scale AI for customer value creation vs. efficiency. Both are extremely important, so they decided to accelerate efficiency to fund the investments in raising customer value — not just take all their savings to the bottom line. In doing so, they also helped employees see that AI would be a lever for growth, not just cuts. As the urgency of moving quickly became clear, the company realized it had to lean into its partnerships with its cloud computing provider and other technology vendors to drive the pace of adoption and make the necessary investments more quickly.

General counsels and chief data and security officers are also shaping companies’ destiny. But forward-looking companies are putting much more nuanced policies into place, recognizing the need to upskill their workforce, while also addressing legitimate responsible AI concerns. One retail CIO actively measures the percent of workers who are using seven different classes of gen AI tools, while also rolling out a company-wide framework for responsible AI design and spelling out three “no-go” zones where the enterprise is not yet ready to apply the technology.

A Different Way of Working

Ultimately, cross-functional working teams are needed to deliver AI at scale. It is no coincidence that our CMO survey and personalization index research showed that the 10% of companies that are gen AI leaders are also the ones that are the furthest ahead in scaling predictive AI solutions. They already have the operational foundation in place and are further ahead in the maturity of their data and technology. Most importantly, they have figured out how to bring together nimble, “two-pizza” teams to get things done. These pods of business, analytics, tech and operations doers come together around well-defined goals, iterate quickly by running rapid tests and measure their progress against well-defined KPIs, learning how to make AI capabilities effective while also delivering impact. Oftentimes, as one of our large airline clients did with their AI-driven personalization, they take a group of customers offline from business-as-usual activities to be able to quickly redesign processes and show value, while having a clear plan for scaling these learnings into the rest of the organization within six months or less.

Instead of treating agile ways of working as something to be managed by a central corporate team, employees across functions at these companies are learning them by doing. Deep involvement of line employees is critical to reshaping how a company operates using AI. Employees understand so many of the nuances a company needs to succeed, how their data needs to be managed, and what customers demand, etc. — all key as inputs into setting up an AI-powered operation. High-potential employees are excited to participate in agile pods, because they see it is the way to make rapid impact, and build new skills, while also proving their capabilities and eventually taking on roles with increased responsibility. In this way, HR teams are thinking of cross-functional pods as energizers of AI transformation, while also being a training ground for top talent as they consider succession planning and career progression.

Transform Experiences Instead of Just Increasing Efficiency

Front-line teams will embrace AI solutions that they directly benefit from beyond just cost savings. For example, a large convenience retailer is rolling out an AI scheduling solution that is not just improving productivity, but also boosting employee satisfaction and lowering turnover by giving store associates shifts and hours that better meet their preferences. Given the enthusiasm of store managers to adopt the new tools, the retailer is rolling out the solution nationally in six months, when past implementations of scheduling tools have taken over two years, driven the complexity of change management.

Furthermore, workers’ enthusiasm grows with AI usage, while the AI gets better from widespread testing and adoption. The same consumer sentiment study cited earlier also found that over 90% of workers who have used gen AI across five or more use cases are excited by its potential. This is why companies like L’Oreal are applying gen AI across customer-facing use cases (e.g., Beauty Genius, a gen AI personal beauty assistant and Modiface, an AI-powered skin diagnostic tool), as well as to aid customer care agents and innovate content generation (L’Oreal’s GenAI content lab).

At the end of the day, smart companies are realizing that strategic prioritization, new cross-functional ways of working and putting AI to use to improve the employee and customer experience are critical to becoming an AI leader. Along the way, they are tapping the intellectual capital of their workforce while also preparing them to stay relevant in the age of AI, as employees build new skills and overcome the capability gap that most executives cite as their greatest hurdle to wider adoption of AI technologies.
