United States President Donald Trump’s deceptive 20 point plan to end his government supported Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza demands disarming of Hamas, representing Palestinians in Gaza, to ensure the security of the settler colonial state of Israel.

However there was no such security for Palestinians whose lands Zionist Jews robbed under British colonial rule to set up Israel which has been bombing and slaughtering Palestinians for more than three quarter century?

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, declared a war criminal by International Criminal Court, ICC, deserved to be tried in a Nuremburg type trial which punished German Nazi war criminals. Instead he was rewarded with a US plan to wipe out Hamas and eliminate Palestinian struggle for freedom and justice.

Arab regimes support this sell out plan which eliminates Hamas and turn Palestinians into non entity.

It is worthy to note that this so-called peace plan comes from President Trump who together with former US President Joe Biden spent $ 30 billion American taxpayers’ money to fund Israel’s genocide of Palestinians and the destruction of Gaza. This comes while Netanyahu claimed that he feels “very” connected to the vision of a “Greater Israel”, which includes occupied Palestinian territory as well as parts of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

UN Commissioner Navi Pillay who criticised Trump’s Gaza plan for its exclusion of Palestinians from transitional governance, said a ceasefire proposal does not alter the UN’s finding that Israel is responsible for genocide.

Who is capable of ensuring that Netanyahu doesn’t violate the ceasefire deal?

Questioning the credibility of the plan columnist Rifat Jawaid asked whether Benjamin Netanyahu can be trusted with the Gaza peace plan. Who is capable of ensuring that Netanyahu doesn’t violate the ceasefire deal once all the hostages are released just like he did in March this year?

Sick and tired of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s sell out agreements and compromises with Israel respected Islamic scholar Sheikh Yassin established Hamas organisation in 1987 during the first intifadas (uprising). As dedicated Muslims, Hamas’ roots are in the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was supported by a robust sociopolitical structure inside the Palestinian territories. But US, hostile to Islam and Muslims, designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO).

Its 1988 charter states that Palestine which include Israel is an Islamic homeland that can never be surrendered to non-Muslims and that waging holy war to take control of Palestine from Israel is a religious duty for Palestinian Muslims. This position brought Hamas into conflict with Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which recognised Israel’s right to exist in 1988.

Hamas opposed the 1993 peace agreement between the PLO and Israel. In the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006 Hamas won and took control of the Gaza Strip.

Unable to put up with decades of extreme Israeli oppression Hamas attacked Israel in October 2003 and triggered the genocide which continues for two years. However according to American political scientist John Mearsheimer Israel killed Israelis and blamed Hamas to trigger this genocide planned ahead with US-European partners.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said in Paris that there could be no future role for Hamas in Gaza while Qatar, Egypt and Turkey began putting pressure on Hamas to limit its objections to Trump’s plan to disarm them

The head of Hamas’s negotiating team Khalil al-Hayya said, “We are ready and positive to [work] towards an agreement that would see the end of the war, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza] and an exchange of prisoners so the war ends forever, and our Palestinian people may live in peace, in accordance with their legitimate aspirations, like all other peoples of the region live.”

Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit

On Monday, 13 October 2025, the city hosted an international summit titled “Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit” co-chaired by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Donald Trump, with the participation of world leaders from more than 20 countries aiming to end the war in the Gaza Strip.

There was no participation by Hamas and Israel. The summit was to discuss the next steps in the implementation of the Gaza peace plan and it was intended that the focus should be on the future governance of the Gaza Strip, security and humanitarian assistance

It was hosted by Trump and Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah Sisi, installed in power by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait at a cost of 11 billion dollar, after crushing emerging democracy headed by Mohamed Morsy of Muslim Brotherhood.

Addressing the Gaza summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, President Donald Trump acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “favourite field marshal from Pakistan” before giving the floor to PM Shehbaz to deliver a speech.

In his speech Shehbaz said, “I would say this is one of the greatest days in contemporary history, because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts. “Efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace who had relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live in peace and prosperity,” he added. The PM reiterated that Pakistan nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his “outstanding, extraordinary contributions to first, stop war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire, along with his very wonderful team”.

Shameful state of affairs of rulers in Muslim countries

This is the shameful state of affairs of rulers in Muslim countries. These treacherous sell out rulers will disappear but Palestinians will live to fight for their legitimate rights to ensure their dignity if not today but tomorrow or day after.

Summing up the situation Palestinian intellectual Azzam Tamimi said “lasting peace will remain elusive without an end to occupation”.

Citing the book “The War” by American investigative journalist Bob Woodward’s one columnist had this to highlight Arab regimes’ hatred towards Hamas.

Anyone who reads the book and the conversations it documents between U.S. Secretary of State “Blinken” and a number of Arab leaders will be shocked to discover that the stance of countries like Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia was not one of silence or abandonment of the people of Gaza, as was previously believed. Instead, the details presented in the book suggest that the governments of these countries are complicit in the destruction of the Palestinians, just like Israel.

Complete indifference to the scale of Palestinian bloodshed

The reader is astonished by the agreement of Arab leaders – from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia Abu Dhabi and Bahrain on the necessity of waging war on Hamas and eliminating it, coupled with their complete indifference to the scale of Palestinian bloodshed. Blinken flew to Abu Dhabi to meet with the President of the UAE, “Mohamed bin Zayed,” who was the most extreme among all the Arab leaders he met, insisting that the war must not stop until Hamas is eradicated in Gaza.

On the morning of the next day, 14 October, Blinken met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, who said: “Israel should not have trusted Hamas. We warned Netanyahu repeatedly. Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood.”

“The Saudi Foreign Minister continued: “Terrorist groups are not only trying to destroy Israel but also to overthrow other Arab leaders. We are concerned about the repercussions of Israel’s actions in Gaza on our collective security, and what comes after Hamas could be worse. ISIS came after Al-Qaeda and is worse than it.”

The book says: Saudi Foreign Minister, told Blinken: “Hamas must be eliminated. We have repeatedly warned Israel that Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood. We can give Israel the space and time to eliminate Hamas, but Israel must also help us by allowing humanitarian aid in so as not to provoke the Arab peoples.”

At that point, Blinken and his team realised the sincerity of the Egyptian regime’s desire to eliminate Hamas, and indeed, he conveyed the information about the Gaza tunnels and Kamel’s message to Netanyahu.

In this context how could Hamas, representing Islam and Palestinians, expect any support from the Arab regimes which openly support US-European backed Israeli genocide of Palestinians?
