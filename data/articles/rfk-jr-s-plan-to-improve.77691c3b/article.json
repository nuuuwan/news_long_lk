    "A lot of Americans don\u2019t eat well. And they\u2019re paying for it with their health. A diet high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat can increase the risk of problems like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, to name a few. And those are among\u00a0the leading causes of death in the US. This is hardly news. But this week Robert F Kennedy Jr., who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services, floated a new solution to the problem. Kennedy and education secretary Linda McMahon think that teaching medical students more about the role of nutrition in health could help turn things around.

    "\u201cI\u2019m working with Linda on forcing medical schools \u2026 to put nutrition into medical school education,\u201d Kennedy said during\u00a0a cabinet meeting on August 26. The next day, HHS released\u00a0a statement calling for \u201cincreased nutrition education\u201d for medical students. \u201cWe can reverse the chronic-disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles,\u201d Kennedy said in\u00a0an accompanying video statement. \u201cBut to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor\u2019s training.\u201d",
    "It certainly sounds like a good idea. If more Americans ate a healthier diet, we could expect to see a decrease in those diseases. But this framing of America\u2019s health crisis is overly simplistic, especially given that plenty of the administration\u2019s other actions have directly undermined health in multiple ways\u2014including by canceling a vital nutrition education program. At any rate, there are other, more effective ways to tackle the chronic-disease crisis.",
    "The biggest killers, heart disease and stroke,\u00a0are responsible for more than a third of deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing those conditions. And it makes total sense to educate the future doctors of America about nutrition. Medical bodies are on board with the idea, too. \u201cThe importance of nutrition in medical education is increasingly clear, and we support expanded, evidence-based instruction to better equip physicians to prevent and manage chronic disease and improve patient outcomes,\u201d David H. Aizuss, chair of the American Medical Association\u2019s board of trustees, said in a statement. But it\u2019s not as though medical students aren\u2019t getting any nutrition education. And that training has increased in the last five years, according to\u00a0surveys carried out by the American Association of Medical Colleges. Kennedy has referred to\u00a0a 2021 survey suggesting that medical students in the US get only around one hour of nutrition education per year. But the AAMC argues that nutrition education increasingly happens through \u201cintegrated experiences\u201d rather than stand-alone lectures.

    "\u201cMedical schools understand the critical role that nutrition plays in preventing, managing, and treating chronic health conditions, and incorporate significant nutrition education across their required curricula,\u201d Alison J. Whelan, AAMC\u2019s chief academic officer, said in a statement. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t room for improvement. Gabby Headrick, a food systems dietician and associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University\u2019s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security, thinks nutritionists could take a more prominent role in patient care, too. But it\u2019s somewhat galling for the administration to choose medical education as its focus given the recent cuts in federal funding that will affect health. For example, funding for the National Diabetes Prevention Program, which offers support and guidance to help thousands of people adopt healthy diets and exercise routines, was canceled by the Trump administration in March. The focus on medical schools also overlooks one of the biggest factors behind poor nutrition in the US: access to healthy food. A recent\u00a0survey by the Pew Research Center found that increased costs make it harder for most Americans to eat well. Twenty percent of the people surveyed acknowledged that their diets were not healthy.",
    "\u201cSo many people know what a healthy diet is, and they know what should be on their plate every night,\u201d says Headrick, who has researched this issue. \u201cBut the vast majority of folks just truly do not have the money or the time to get the food on the plate.\u201d The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been helping low-income Americans afford some of those healthier foods. It\u00a0supported over 41 million people in 2024. But under the Trump administration\u2019s tax and spending bill,\u00a0the program is set to lose around $186 billion in funding over the next 10 years. Kennedy\u2019s focus is on education. And it just so happens that there is a nutrition education program in place\u2014one that helps people of all ages learn not only what healthy foods are, but how to source them on a budget and use them to prepare meals. SNAP-Ed, as it\u2019s known, has already provided this support to millions of Americans. Under the Trump administration, it is\u00a0set to be eliminated. It is difficult to see how these actions are going to help people adopt healthier diets. What might be a better approach? I put the question to Headrick: If she were in charge, what policies would she enact? \u201cUniversal health care,\u201d she told me. Being able to access health care without risking financial hardship not only\u00a0improves health outcomes and life expectancy; it also spares people from medical debt\u2014something that\u00a0affects around 40% of adults in the US, according to a recent survey. And the Trump administration\u2019s plans to\u00a0cut federal health spending by about a trillion dollars over the next decade certainly aren\u2019t going to help with that. All told, around 16 million people could lose their health insurance by 2034, according to\u00a0estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe evidence suggests that if we cut folks\u2019 social benefit programs, such as access to health care and food, we are going to see detrimental impacts,\u201d says Headrick. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to cause an increased burden of preventable disease.\u201d This article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.
