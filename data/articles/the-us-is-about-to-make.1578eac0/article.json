    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Voters have elected Donald Trump to a second term in the White House.  In the days leading up to the election, I kept thinking about what four years means for climate change right now. We\u2019re at a critical moment that requires decisive action to rapidly slash greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, transportation, industry, and the rest of the economy if we\u2019re going to achieve our climate goals. The past four years have seen the US take climate action seriously, working with the international community and pumping money into solutions. Now, we\u2019re facing a period where things are going to be very different. A Trump presidency will have impacts far beyond climate, but for the sake of this newsletter, we\u2019ll stay focused on what four years means in the climate fight as we start to make sense of this next chapter.",
    "Joe Biden arguably did more to combat climate change than any other American president. One of his first actions in office was rejoining the Paris climate accord\u2014Trump pulled out of the international agreement to fight climate change during his first term in office. Biden then quickly set a new national goal to cut US carbon emissions in half, relative to their peak, by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency rolled out rules for power plants to slash pollution that harms both human health and the climate. The agency also announced new regulations for vehicle emissions to push the country toward EVs.",
    "And the cornerstone of the Biden years has been unprecedented climate investment. A trio of laws\u2014the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure and research, much of it on climate. Related StoryTrump wants to unravel Biden\u2019s landmark climate law. Here is what\u2019s most at risk.The Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s support for EVs and clean power could land on the chopping block if the Republican front-runner returns to the White House.",
    "Now, this ship is about to make a quick turn. Donald Trump has regularly dismissed the threat of climate change and promised throughout the campaign to counter some of Biden\u2019s key moves. We can expect to see a dramatic shift in how the US talks about climate on the international stage. Trump has vowed to once again withdraw from the Paris agreement. Things are going to be weird at the annual global climate talks that kick off next week. We can also expect to see efforts to undo some of Biden\u2019s key climate actions, most centrally the Inflation Reduction Act, as my colleague James Temple covered earlier this year.  What, exactly, Trump can do will depend on whether Republicans take control of both houses of Congress. A clean sweep would open up more lanes for targeting legislation passed under Biden. (As of sending this email, Republicans have secured enough seats to control the Senate, but the House is uncertain and could be for days or even weeks.) I don\u2019t think the rug will be entirely pulled out from under the IRA\u2014portions of the investment from the law are beginning to pay off, and the majority of the money has gone to Republican districts. But there will certainly be challenges to pieces, especially the EV tax credits, which Trump has been laser-focused on during the campaign. This all adds up to a very different course on climate than what many had hoped we might see for the rest of this decade. A Trump presidency could add 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere by 2030 over what was expected from a second Biden term, according to an analysis published in April by the website Carbon Brief (this was before Biden dropped out of the race). That projection sees emissions under Trump dropping by 28% below the peak by the end of the decade\u2014nowhere near the 50% target set by Biden at the beginning of his term.",
    "The US, which is currently the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter and has added more climate pollution to the atmosphere than any other nation, is now very unlikely to hit Biden\u2019s 2030 goal. That\u2019s basically the final nail in the coffin for efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) over preindustrial levels. In the days, weeks, and years ahead we'll be covering\u00a0what this change will mean for efforts to combat climate change and to protect the most vulnerable from the dangerous world we\u2019re marching toward\u2014indeed, already living in.
