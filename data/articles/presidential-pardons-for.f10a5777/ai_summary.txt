In Sri Lanka, it is a customary tradition that many prisoners are pardoned by the president during national festivals, like Independence Day, Vesak, and Christmas, most of whom are accused of minor petty crimes. The Task Force on Judicial and Legal Causes for Prison Overcrowding and Prison Reforms shows around 52% of the Sri Lankan prison population is unconvicted of any crime, and the state spends around Rs. 8.3 billion on prisoner maintenance. However, these traditions have been abused by some previous presidents who have pardoned convicted criminals, such as former President J.R. Jayewardene pardoning convicted rapist and criminal 'Gonawala Sunil' and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa commuting the life sentence of a convicted double murderer. The article calls for future presidents to exercise their power responsibly and avoid succumbing to political pressure.
