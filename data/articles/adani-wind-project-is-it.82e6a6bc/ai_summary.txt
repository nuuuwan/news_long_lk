1.🔆 The Mannar wind project in Sri Lanka is being hit with criticism, despite its potential for sustainable energy development and attracting foreign investment. 
2.🔄 The project follows government-to-government process, complies with the Electricity Act, and was chosen after a transparent RFP.
3. 🌎 The project also aligns with the Asian Development Bank's recommendations for addressing climate risks and fostering sustainable development in Sri Lanka.
4.📊 Rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment studies were conducted, taking into account 20 years of data, to ensure minimal ecological disruption.
5.🦅 To address concerns about migratory birds, project developers commit to AI radar systems to detect incoming flocks and mitigation strategies like painted blade tips to prevent collisions.
6.🌬️ Larger wind turbines reduce the risk of bird collisions and the project actually shrinks the land footprint compared to other projects.
7.💵 The USD 8.26 cents tariff set for the project is not as high compared to cost from existing thermal power plants, and will save the country annually $260 million in foreign exchange.
8. 🌐 While other countries may achieve lower tariffs due to economies of scale and favourable conditions, Sri Lanka's project pricing is reflective of its unique challenges.
9. ⚡ The Mannar II project is expected to generate 1,498 GWh of renewable energy annually, significantly reducing the nation's reliance on fossil fuels and fitting in with the goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2050.
10. 🏭 The project is predicted to offer significant economic benefits, including the creation of over 1,000 jobs, and aims to work collaboratively with local communities.
