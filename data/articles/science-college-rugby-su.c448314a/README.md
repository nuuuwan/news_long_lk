Calls for fair play and responsibility; urges schools, administrators, and policymakers to act with integrity

The Science College Rugby Support Group (SCRSG), the governing body responsible for rugby at

Science College, Mount Lavinia has decried poaching of its players by other schools via deceptive scholarships.

It has also called for fair play and responsibility urging stakeholders including schools, administrators and policymakers to act with integrity.

Following is the statement issued by the Support Group.

With a proud legacy spanning over 40 years, Science College has made a remarkable contribution to Sri Lankan rugby — producing national captains, numerous players at both national and club level, and shaping the country’s rugby landscape with distinction and recognition.

The recently concluded Elite Under-16 Tournament, in which Science College finished as Cup Runners-up, once again demonstrated the immense talent within our school and the strength of our rugby culture. However, this success has also reignited a familiar and deeply concerning issue: player poaching — often disguised as “scholarships” — by more affluent schools.

As a school that has repeatedly found itself at the receiving end of this orchestrated practice, we feel compelled to highlight the reality we face. A closer look at our performance across age groups reveals a consistent winning rate of over 85% at junior levels — an extraordinary achievement by any standard. Yet, this success is not reflected at senior level. Our 1st XV team, despite its talent, has struggled to remain competitive, often surviving in the top division by winning just a few games against weaker sides and failing to make a significant impact in recent years.

This stark disparity can be traced back to two interconnected issues: 1. Significant financial disparities in school rugby programs. 2. Systematic poaching of our skilled players by a handful of wealthier schools.

Proponents of these so-called scholarship programs argue that they provide players from less affluent schools a “better platform” to excel. We strongly reject this argument. The facts speak for themselves — in recent Sri Lanka national test squads, four to five players were former Science College students. This clearly shows that Science provides the platform and environment for excellence. The “scholarship” narrative is nothing more than a convenient justification for importing talent to win trophies.

This practice exploits loopholes in the school system, which often fails to recognise the broader educational value of sports — an integral component of holistic education. The damage to Science College goes far beyond losing talented players. Since this poaching occurs within the same playing division, it is arguably the most damaging form of talent drain in school rugby.

We also question the effectiveness of these well-funded systems, which — despite their vast resources — fail to develop talent from their own large student populations, while relying instead on recruiting from a school of just 1,600 students.

The massive financial investments in school rugby should rightly be a matter for education and sports authorities to regulate. However, in the meantime, we make a sincere request: Leave our players to grow and compete for Science College.

For our school, rugby is far more than a sport — it is a binding force that unites a diverse social fabric and provides purpose, pride, and opportunity. Supporting Science College rugby is about more than winning matches; it is about protecting social inclusiveness, empowering underprivileged youth, and preserving the true spirit of sport.

We call upon all stakeholders — schools, administrators, and policymakers — to act with integrity, fairness, and respect for the values that make rugby a game worth playing.
