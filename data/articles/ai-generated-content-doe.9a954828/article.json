    "AI-generated falsehoods and deepfakes seem to have had no effect on election results in the UK, France, and the European Parliament this year, according to new research.\u00a0 Since the beginning of the generative-AI boom, there has been widespread fear that AI tools could boost bad actors\u2019 ability to spread fake content with the potential to interfere with elections or even sway the results. Such worries were particularly heightened this year, when billions of people were expected to vote in over 70 countries.\u00a0  Those fears seem to have been unwarranted, says Sam Stockwell, the researcher at the Alan Turing Institute who conducted the study. He focused on three elections over a four-month period from May to August 2024, collecting data on public reports and news articles on AI misuse. Stockwell identified 16 cases of AI-enabled falsehoods or deepfakes that went viral during the UK general election and only 11 cases in the EU and French elections combined, none of which appeared to definitively sway the results. The fake AI content was created by both domestic actors and groups linked to hostile countries such as Russia.\u00a0 These findings are in line with recent warnings from experts that the focus on election interference is distracting us from deeper and longer-lasting threats to democracy.",
    "AI-generated content seems to have been ineffective as a disinformation tool in most European elections this year so far. This, Stockwell says, is because most of the people who were exposed to the disinformation already believed its underlying message (for example, that levels of immigration to their country are too high). Stockwell\u2019s analysis showed that people who were actively engaging with these deepfake messages by resharing and amplifying them had some affiliation or previously expressed views that aligned with the content. So the material was more likely to strengthen preexisting views than to influence undecided voters.\u00a0 Tried-and-tested election interference tactics, such as flooding comment sections with bots and exploiting influencers to spread falsehoods, remained far more effective. Bad actors mostly used generative AI to rewrite news articles with their own spin or to create more online content for disinformation purposes.",
    "\u201cAI is not really providing much of an advantage for now, as existing, simpler methods of creating false or misleading information continue to be prevalent,\u201d says Felix Simon, a researcher at the Reuters Institute for Journalism, who was not involved in the research.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s hard to draw firm conclusions about AI\u2019s impact upon elections at this stage, says Samuel Woolley, a disinformation expert at the University of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s in part because we don\u2019t have enough data. \u201cThere are less obvious, less trackable, downstream impacts related to uses of these tools that alter civic engagement,\u201d he adds. Stockwell agrees: Early evidence from these elections suggests that AI-generated content could be more effective for harassing politicians and sowing confusion than changing people\u2019s opinions on a large scale.\u00a0 Politicians in the UK, such as former prime minister Rishi Sunak, were targeted by AI deepfakes that, for example, showed them promoting scams or admitting to financial corruption. Female candidates were also targeted with nonconsensual sexual deepfake content, intended to disparage and intimidate them.\u00a0 \u201cThere is, of course, a risk that in the long run, the more that political candidates are on the receiving end of online harassment, death threats, deepfake pornographic smears\u2014that can have a real chilling effect on their willingness to, say, participate in future elections, but also obviously harm their well-being,\u201d says Stockwell.\u00a0 Perhaps more worrying, Stockwell says, his research indicates that people are increasingly unable to discern the difference between authentic and AI-generated content in the election context. Politicians are also taking advantage of that. For example, political candidates in the European Parliament elections in France have shared AI-generated content amplifying anti-immigration narratives without disclosing that they\u2019d been made with AI.\u00a0 \u201cThis covert engagement, combined with a lack of transparency, presents in my view a potentially greater risk to the integrity of political processes than the use of AI by the general population or so-called \u2018bad actors,\u2019\u201d says Simon.\u00a0 hide"
