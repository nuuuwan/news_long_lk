    "__________________________Thai Space Expo October 16-18, 2025             ___Bangkok, Thailand  It\u2019s a scorching October day in Bangkok and I\u2019m wandering through the exhibits at the Thai Space Expo, held in one of the city\u2019s busiest shopping malls, when I do a double take. Amid the flashy space suits and model rockets on display, there\u2019s a plain-looking package of Thai basil chicken. I\u2019m told the same kind of vacuum-\u00adsealed package has just been launched to the International Space Station. \u201cThis is real chicken that we sent to space,\u201d says a spokesperson for the business behind the stunt, Charoen Pokphand Foods, the biggest food company in Thailand.  It\u2019s an unexpected sight, one that reflects the growing excitement within the Southeast Asian space sector. At the expo, held among designer shops and street-food stalls, enthusiastic attendees have converged from emerging space nations such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and of course Thailand to showcase Southeast Asia\u2019s fledgling space industry. While there is some uncertainty about how exactly the region\u2019s space sector may evolve, there is plenty of optimism, too. \u201cSoutheast Asia is perfectly positioned to take leadership as a space hub,\u201d says Candace Johnson, a partner in Seraphim Space, a UK investment firm that operates in Singapore. \u201cThere are a lot of opportunities.\u201d",
    "A sample package of pad krapow was also on display.COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR   For example, Thailand may build a spaceport to launch rockets in the next few years, the country\u2019s Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency announced the day before the expo started. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a spaceport in Southeast Asia,\u201d says Atipat Wattanuntachai, acting head of the space economy advancement division at the agency. \u201cWe saw a gap.\u201d Because Thailand is so close to the equator, those rockets would get an additional boost from Earth\u2019s rotation. All kinds of companies here are exploring how they might tap into the global space economy. VegaCosmos, a startup based in Hanoi, Vietnam, is looking at ways to use satellite data for urban planning. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is monitoring rainstorms from space to predict landslides. And the startup Spacemap, from Seoul, South Korea, is developing a new tool to better track satellites in orbit, which the US Space Force has invested in.",

In June, astronauts on the space station were treated to this popular dish, known as pad krapow. It\u2019s more commonly served up by street vendors, but this time it was delivered on a private mission operated by the US-based company Axiom Space. Charoen Pokphand is now using the stunt to say its chicken is good enough for NASA (sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to taste it to weigh in). Other Southeast Asian industries could also lend expertise to future space missions. Johnson says the region could leverage its manufacturing prowess to develop better semiconductors for satellites, for example, or break into the in-space manufacturing market. I left the expo on a Thai longboat down the Chao Phraya River that weaves through Bangkok, with visions of astronauts tucking into some pad krapow in my head and imagining what might come next.
