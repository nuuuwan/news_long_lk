Sri Lanka's political divide continues to widen, highlighted by protests held in Colombo two years ago calling for certain politicians to step down. Meanwhile, a presidential election is expected later this year. The current Sri Lankan head of state, whose party is credited with a small economic revival, rather controversially dismissed the protests and urged the people to support government efforts to rebuild the country's economy. However, critics argue that the economy is still struggling under heavy loans and rising costs. The regime aims to increase domestic produce and explore untapped foreign markets, however the opposition criticises the government for not moving beyond exporting traditional commodities such as tea, rubber and coconut. Concerns have also arisen about the government's plans to sell national assets. The current leadership has been condemned for ignoring the opinion of the younger generation and trying to manipulate their views. The majority of the country's older lawmakers are also criticised for being past their prime, indicating a need for fresh, youthful influence. There is a lingering call for another protest over an election.
