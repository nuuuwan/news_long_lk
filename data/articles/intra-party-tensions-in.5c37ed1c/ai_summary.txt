Increasing intra-party tensions have become evident in the US ahead of the November elections, with both Republicans and Democrats disagreeing over major foreign policy issues. House Republicans recently attempted for a second time in seven months to depose speaker Mike Johnson over the Ukraine aid package. Conversely, President Joe Biden is facing pushback from inside his own party over his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Biden is struggling to mediate between the traditional party establishment, which supports the US-Israeli alliance, and progressives, who are concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. These internal disagreements could limit either party's ability to unify their base and may prove problematic in the build-up to the elections.
