The ruling parties in Sri Lanka can manipulate laws to allow for delaying or advancing elections, undermining electoral fairness, according to rules in the country's constitution. The Sri Lankan constitution states the president is elected by the people for a five-year term, but enables the incumbent leader to seek a second mandate after four years in office. However, it does not allow the president to delay the presidential election, although the country's main opposition party, theÂ Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), expressed uncertainty last year that the election would actually take place as legally required. The fear among opposition parties is that the law could be bent to delay the election, while the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party's founder, Basil Rajapaksa, has called for a general election to be held before the presidential vote.
