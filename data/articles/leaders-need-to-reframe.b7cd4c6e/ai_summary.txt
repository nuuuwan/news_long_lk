Facts presented:

- A number of high-profile companies including Google, Farmers Insurance, Disney, UPS, Boeing, IBM, and Amazon have required employees to return to the office.
- The mandates for employees to return to the office have sparked backlash and social media fervor.
- Research at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple found that how return to the office (RTO) mandates were introduced and implemented significantly impacted departures, especially among employees with longer tenure.
- Social science research indicates that how a problem is framed greatly impacts outcomes.
- Work design is suggested to be a collaborative, community problem-solving process instead of a contest between remote and in-office work.
- Alterations to flexible work policies during and after the Covid pandemic led to substantial life changes for many employees that are not easy to undo.

Opinions expressed:

- The recent messaging from company leaders demanding that employees return to the office has often been adversarial or dictatorial and felt tone-deaf.
- Existing narratives on flexible work policies need to be reframed with more helpful ones.
- Leaders should recognize the trade-offs to manage in the flexibility conversation and be patient.
- Company leaders need to focus on mutual value, not just organizational benefits when discussing remote work and RTO policies.
- The leadership side of RTO has been dominated more by threats of reduced pay or firing for non-compliance, instead of encouraging employees to return to the office.
- Focusing on making the office an energizing environment where employees want to be would be more effective than forcing employees into the office against their will.
