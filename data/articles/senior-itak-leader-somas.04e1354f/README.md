Veteran Tamil political  leader Somasundaram Senathirajah popularly known as “Maavai” Senathirajah breathed his last on 29 January 2025. The octogenarian six-footer suffered a brain concussion after a fall in the bathroom of his residence  at Maaviddapuram on January 26th. He was admitted to the Thellippalai base hospital where a brain haemorrage was detected. Senathirajah was then transferred to the Jaffna teaching hospital and placed under intensive care. Maavai Senathirajah passed away on Wednesday without regaining consciousness. The funeral was held at Senathirajah’s residence in Maaviddapuram on Sunday Feb 2nd. Cremation was at the Thachcankaadu Hindu Cemetery.

History is replete with instances of   youthful political rebels  blossoming  into responsible political leaders . The rebellious   youths  who engaged in volatile protest  demonstrations and campaigns, evolve in later life into  stable, conventional  pillars of the political establishment. Sri Lanka too has many such examples on either side of the ethnic divide.  Maavai Senathirajah’s name  too can be included in  that list of examples.

Maavai Senathirajah  is  a Sri Lankan  Tamil politician  who   spent many years of his life  in    different prisons as a political prisoner in the past. The yesteryear political rebel  transformed into  the  respected   leader of the premier political party of the Sri Lankan Tamils in later life. The former leader of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) known as the Federal Party(FP) in English  has been a Parliamentarian for 25 years. Five of these years was as a national list MP.  He was for Twenty years an elected MP from Jaffna district.

Let me begin this article about ‘Maavai”Senathirajah  on a personal note. I have known ” Senathi Annan”  for 50  years. I first  became acquainted  with him   as a GCE (AL) student at Jaffna College, Vaddukkoddai in the early seventies of the previous century.  I did not interact  closely with him  then.

Those were the days of  much student and youth unrest in Jaffna.The united front Govt of Prime minister  Sirima Bandaranaike was in power then.. There were many Hartals, boycotts, protest marches, processions, black flag demonstrations, fasts etc in that period.Senathirajah was in the forefront as a prominent Tamil youth activist. Senathirajah the six-foot strapper cut a dashing figure then. The long haired Senathi would tie a band  around his forehead then. At times he sported a moustache and beard too.  Senathirajah striding  with his chest thrust forward  had a “revolutionary”appearance then.

Maavai Senathirajah  was among the 42  youth leaders arrested and detained without trial by the United Front Govt headed by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The  trio of  Namasivayam  Anandavinayagam alias “Vannai Ananthan”,  Kathamuthu Sivananthan alias “Kasi Anandan” and Somasundaram Senathirajah alias “Maavai” Senathirajah were  detained for years as political prisoners  then. All three of them were  inspiring Tamil heroes to many politically  conscious Tamil students and youths in those days.

In later years I became a journalist and came across  Maavai Senathirajah the rising star of Tamil politics  in a personal and professional capacity.  I was first introduced to him in Colombo by my close friend and one -time political activist “Mandoor” Mahendran in 1977. I  had joined the “Virakesari” as a  cub reporter in 1977. I have met Maavai   since then at different  times in different places such as Jaffna, Mannar,  Colombo, Batticaloa, Chennai and Toronto. I have watched Senathirajah’s evolution and growth as a Tamil political leader over the years. Besides  like Senathirajah my wife too is from Maaviddapuram  . It is against this backdrop therefore that I write about him on this solemn  occasion.

As  stated earlier  Senathirajah  is from the Northern village of Maviddapuram falling under the Valigamam North  Pradeshiya Sabha and/or the Thellippalai AGA division area.There is a tendency in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka to shorten in common usage the names of Tamil places with  comparatively longer names.

In Tamil Nadu Coimbatore is known as Koavai, Thanjavoor as Thanjai and Tirunelveli as Nellai .  In Jaffna,  places like  Karaveddy, Neervaeli and Kopay are referred to as “Karavai,Neervai and Koavai” respectively. Likewise Maviddapuram is referred in short as “Maavai”. Senathirajah had the prefix “Maavai”attached to his name as  he was a native of  Maaviddapuram.

Under the earlier first pass the post winner electoral system Maviddapuram formed part of the Kankesanthurai(KKS) constituency. The most famous landmark of Maviddapuram is the historic  temple dedicated to Lord Muruga known as the Maviddapuram Kandaswamy temple.

Next to the Kandaswamy deity known as “Mavvaik Kanthan”, Senathirajah known as “Maavai” Senathirajah was  perhaps the most well-known  representative of Maviddapuram in recent times. Many addressed him simply as  “Senathi”, “Maavai” or “Maavai Anna”(elder brother Maavai). I called him SEnathi annan.

Senathirajah’s  father Somasundaram and mother Thaiyalnayagi were from families traditionally engaged in agriculture. However his father   earlier worked as a clerk  in a  business establishment in what was  then known as the  federated  Malay states till the  second world war.  Somasundaram  fled Malaya  a few months  before the Japanese conquest in December 1941.

Upon his return Somasundaram married and engaged in  agro- business.Maviddapuram was once well-known for its “Vettrilai” (betel) . Somasundaram  became a large-scale cultivator and trader of betel. Senathirajah born on 27 October  1942 was the eldest  of seven children comprising four boys and three girls.

Young Senathi  studied up to the  Senior School Certificate(SSC)  at Veemankamam Maha Vidyalayam.  He later joined  Nadeswara College at Kankesanthurai for his Higher School Certificate(HSC). The SSC and HSC were equivalent then to the GCE (OL) and GCE (AL) exams of now. Senathirajah however was not very interested in studies. He was more inclined to help his father in the betel  business and  immerse himself in political activity and social service.

Having failed to enter  Varsity as an internal student , Senathirajah registered as an external student at the Peradeniya university  for a BA  degree and followed classes in Jaffna. He never completed his degree in Sri Lanka. At one point he gained admission to the  Sri Lanka Law College but could not attend classes as he was arrested  and detained for his politics.  It was  as a political refugee in Tamil Nadu  with his family after the 1983 Black July anti-Tamil pogrom that Senathirajah was able to complete his tertiary studies.He  reportedly enrolled as an external student for  courses  in  History and Tamil studies at  Annamalai university in Chidambaram and finally graduated  after intermittent periods of study.

Maavai Senathirajah’s political awakening was in 1956 as a teen aged student at Veemankamam  Mahavidyalayam.   The newly elected SWRD Bandaranaike Govt enacted Sinhala as the sole official language excluding Tamil. The ITAK/FP led by SJV Chelvanayagam commenced a Satyagraha  on Galle Face Green opposite the old Parliament on June 5th 1956. A mob transported by ministers and MP’s in the Govt set upon the peacefully protesting   non – violent Satyagrahis  and assaulted them while the Police watched as passive spectators.

Among the  Satygrahis was “Arasaratnam Master” a school teacher at Veemankamam Maha Vidyalayam. He returned home  in tattered clothes with assault injuries   and  vividly narrated all what had happened in Colombo. The injustice of what  had happened  at Galle face green kindled  a spark in young Senadhi’s mind.

That spark was further ignited by subsequent happenings. The anti- Tamil  violence of 1958 saw ship loads of Tamils  from the south being  ferried across the seas to Trincomalee, Point Pedro and Kankesanthurai  harbours as refugees in their own and native land. Senathirajah was  among the student volunteers who catered to the needs of the displaced people brought to KKS. Their sorrowful tales about their harrowing experiences affected  young Senathirajah.

In 1960 two successive Parliamentary elections were held in March and July. Senathirajah though a student  worked hard  to ensure the  victory of SJV Chelvanayagam in the Kankesanthurai electorate.  He also became a member of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK)While Chelvanayagam was returned with thumping majorities the ITAK/FP won 15 and 16 seats respectively at the two hustings

In 1961 the ITAK/FP launched a Satyagraha campaign that paralysed the civil administration of the Tamil majority Jaffna,Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa  district Kachcheries or secretariats for nearly three months. There were no Mullaitheevu, Amparai  or Kilinochchi districts then. The Satyagraha was at its zenith in Jaffna where even a separate postal service was started and stamps and post cards issued.

The SLFP Govt of the day  cracked down hard by deploying the army to quell a peaceful protest. Senathirajah was then a student at Nadeswara college. Senathirajah  along with many other students  skipped school and participated in processions and demonstrations. He was also among  volunteers rendering  assistance to  the Satygarahis.

Politicization of Maavai

All these experiences  resulted in the politicization of  Maavai  Senathirajah. He was  first elected as president of the ITAK youth front in Kankesanthurai (KKS)electorate. Subsequently he became the joint secretary of the ITAK youth front and served in that capacity for eight years.

The unjust standardization scheme  of 1970  in which  a Tamil student had to obtain more than a Sinhala student to gain admission to prestigious courses in University  had a devastating impact on Tamil youths in general and students in particular.

Two new Tamil organizations were set up by disgruntled students and youths. One was the “Thamil Maanavar Pearavai”(Tamil Student Federation). The other was the “Thamil Ilaingar Pearavai”(Tamil youth federation). Senathirajah was very active in the Youth federation and served as its president.

The advent of the Ilaingar Paeravai or Youth Federation had a radicalizing influence on Tamil politics. A quiet sub-terranean campaign  propagating the goal of forming a separate Tamil state through an armed struggle got underway. The April 1971 JVP insurgency and the creation of Bangla Desh in December 1971 boosted these  separatist thoughts further.

Senathirajah was one of those who felt the Tamils needed a country of their own. He was one of those critical of the ITAK for joining the UNP led Government of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake in 1965. He was also enamoured of the “Tamil self-rule”policy of ex-Kayts MP V. Navaratnam. Senathirajah had remained loyal to the  federalist ITAK at the 1970 elections. However his sympathies were with those who  supported a Tamil separate state.

The youth leader Senathirajah associated with a wide range of  radical  Tamil youths in those days. Some  of them went on to become members and leaders of armed Tamil movements in later days.  Anong these were persons like Prabhakaran,Umamaheswaran,Padmanabha, Kuttimani and  Sri Sabaratnam.

Senathirajah once told me that he may have got directly involved with the Tamil militant movements and engaged in violence but for the fact that he was  arrested beforehand and jailed.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike Govt

When the Tamil United Front(TUF)was formed in  May.1972, Senathirajah was elected as youth wing leader. He was soon arrested and imprisoned without trial by the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Govt. Senathirajah was among 42 Tamil youths held in jail without trial for over three years. They were released in January 1975 but were jailed again in July 1975 after the assassination of Jaffna mayor Alfred Durayappah. They were released a few months before the July 1977 election.

When Maavai was released in Colombo  and returned to Jaffna by train, the “Yarl Devi”was stopped at every railway station from Vavuniya onwards. Large crowds of Tamil youths delayed the train from proceeding and felicitated him. Youths pricked their tthumbs and placed a thilak or Pottu on hs forehead with r=the oozing blood. Maavais shirt was crimson with blood stains then

I had a lengthy conversation with Senadhi Annan in October 2017 when he celebrated his 75th Birthday. We spoke for hours and hours then. He was in reminiscent mood and related many things about himself. It was then that he said he would very likely have got involved with a militant movement in the  early seventies if he had not been arrested.Tamil armed militancy was in an embryonic stage then. “Sirimavo did a good thing by arresting me then” chuckled Senathirajah then.

Seventy-Five Months  in Eight Prisons

Even though Senathirajah never got embroiled in political  or revolutionary violence, he suffered prolonged imprisonment in phases. Maavai has been held at different times at the magazine prison, Welikade jail, Anuradhapura, ,Kalutara. Bogambara, Batticaloa, Elephant Pass and Jaffna Fort. The various periods of incarceration added together amounted  to nearly seventy-five months  spent in eight prisons

Senathirajah underwent much torture and hardship during his periods of detention. Since he held administrative positions in the Tamil youth organizations the authorities interrogating him felt he would have a lot of information. So they resorted to third degree methods when quizzing him. Besides Senathirajah was a tall, well built man. Many of the “puny”officials questioning him were bullies who relished causing pain to a man bigger than them . On one ocasion Maavai  was beaten badly and brought back to his cell in an unconscious state.

When the Non-aligned countries  Summit conference was held in Colombo in 1976, the Tamil political detenuews went on a prolonged hunger strike  demanding that they be brought to court or released. In a bid to break up the fast, the ring leaders were transferred to other prisons. Senathirajah was taken to the Bogampara prison in Kandy and kept in isolation. Senathirajah determinedly continued the fast. He  ended the hunger strike upon an appeal made by SJV Chelvanayagam.

Apart from the detention and torture, Senathirajah suffered financially too at times. I have witnessed personally the difficulties he and his family underwent in Madras now Chennai. The TULF had an office at Thanigasala Mudali street in Pondy Bazaar in Madras then. Senathirajah with his family was also staying at the premises. Those were tough times. But Senathi single-handely ran that office those days and kept the TULF flag flying. Eventually things improved  with Senathirajah’s siblings abroad helping out.

Senathirajah’s life took a turn for the better after he began engaging in electoral politics. Senathirajah who served as  Youth Front president and Politburo member of the TULF,  contested  Parliamentary  elections for the first time in 1989. He polled only 2820 votes in Jaffna and was not elected. In 1994, Senathirajah  contested from  eastern Amparai district in 1994  but was not elected.

Despite being unsuccessful in the 1989 and 1994 elections, Senathirajah did enter Parliament as a national list MP  on both occasions. This was due to  two assassinations by the LTTE. Appapillai Amirthalingam was gunned down by tiger assassins in July 1989. Senathirajah replaced Amirthalingam as national list MP. Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam was appointed TULF national list MP in 1994.He was killed in July 1999  in a tiger suicide bomber attack. Again Senathirajah was appointed National list MP   in place of Neelan.

Senathirajah was electorally successful in the new millennium. He was elected to Parliament from Jaffna electoral district in the elections of 2000, 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2015. He obtained 10,965 Preference votes in 2000 and  33,831 votes in 2001.  Senathirajah contested these polls under the sun symbol of the Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF)

From 2004, Senathirajah contested polls under the house symbol of the Ilankai Thamil  Arasuk Katchi(ITAK). He won in 2004, 2010 and 2015 with preference vote tallies of 38783, 20501 and 58782 respectively. Maavai’s successful spree of electoral victories in Jaffna came to an end in 2020. He polled 20,358 votes and was not elected.Senathirajah did not contest the 2024 election.

The ITAK formed in 1949 was active in politics as a separate  political party till 1977. In 1977 the ITAK was the chief constituent of the Tamil United Liberation Front .Although the ITAK became electorally dormant, the party  continued to retain its party registration. In 2001, the newly formed Tamil National alliance contested on the  TULF Sun symbol. However the TNA was unable to contest under the TULF symbol in 2004 because of a legal wrangle. Hence the ITAK was brought in again and the TNA contested under the House symbol

Thus the ITAK  which was dormant from 1977 to 2004 was revived again. The party remained subservient to the LTTE as part of the TNA. In May 2009 the LTTE  was militarily defeated. In 2010 the ITAK held its party convention after many years. Rajavarothayam Sampanthan became ITAK president and Somasundaram  Senathirajah the ITAK General secretary. In 2014. Sampanthan stepped down. Senathirajah became ITAK president. He served in that position  for 10 years until 2024. Maavai came in for much criticism for prolonging his presidency “By hook or by crook” for a decade.

However it must be noted that Senathirajah acted magnanimously in 2013 when the elections to the Northern Provincial Council were held.Maavai wanted to be the TNA nominee for the chief minister post. Most ITAK members and other constituents of the TNA such as the PLOTE,TELO and EPRLF were supportive of Maavai’s candidacy. Yet TNA leader Sampanthan wanted to field retired supreme court judge C.V.Wigneswaran as the TNA chief ministerial candidate. Despite the overwhelming support enjoyed by him, Senathirajah acceded to Sampanthan’s wishes and backed out from the contest. Wigneswaran was the unanmous candidate.

Senathirajah is survived by his wife Bavaani ,daughter Thaarakaa and sons Kalaiamuthan and Aaraavamuthan. The sons were named Amuthan after former TULF leader Amirthalingam who was called “Amuthar”. Senathirajah’s daughter is a medical doctor in India. Younger son Aaraavamuthan is an engineer in Singapore. Elder son Kalaiamuthan is in Sri Lanka and dabbles in politics. He was a member of the Valigaamam north Pradeshiya Sabha and is married to Pravina ,daughter of former Jaffna district MP N.Raviraj.

Life Summed Up in Two Parts

The track record of Maavai Senathirajah in Tamil politics  could be summed up in  two parts. The first part corresponds to the early period of his life. Senathirajah the youth activist participated in many protests, underwent imprisonment for political reasons and made considerable sacrifices. His life especially while being self-exiled in India was a tremendous struggle in more ways than one. I have witnessed this first-hand.

The second part of his life is different. This Senathirajah was not the idealist of yore. This  Senathirajah was  a calculating, selfish politico who was  determined to remain on top and was  prepared to do anything for it. Senathirajah  displayed a selfish greed for political office. The  attempts made by him to  become national list MP and cling on to party leadership  indefinitely were pathetic.

Those who remember the younger Senathirajah whose life was a struggle full of sacrifices would  be  reluctant to condemn or criticise him. They will  continue to be sympathetic to him, thinking of his past despite what he  had turned into later. This writer too is one who  had a soft corner for “Senathi Annai” until it was unbearable.

Sweet  not Sour “Swansong”

It was with great reluctance therefore that I wrote  last year , a critical article about the unbearable selfishness of Maavai Senathirajah.  Before and after writing, I communicated with him privately also. What I urged then was that Maavai Senathirajah should do what was  right and to do it fast. I wrote to him that it was  time for him to let go of the reins of the ITAK willingly. I pointed out that Senathi Annan’s swansong should be sweet and not sour !

Sadly he did not listen and  the result was a lot of bitterness and acrimony.the last months of his life were not happy to say the least. Now that Senathirajah is no more, I do not want to  discuss this any more. I want to remember Senathi Annan as the young political activist who spent years of his life in prison and underwent much hardship for the cause he believed in. Let Maavai Senathirajah be remembered as the  symbol of Tamil resistance to majoritarian hegemony for more than five decades.
