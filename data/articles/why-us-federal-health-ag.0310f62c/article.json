    "This time five years ago, we were in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic. By August 2020, we\u2019d seen school closures, national lockdowns, and widespread panic. That year, the coronavirus\u00a0was responsible for around 3 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Then came the vaccines. The first mRNA vaccines for covid were authorized for use in December 2020. By the end of the following month, over 100 million doses had been administered.\u00a0Billions more have been administered since then. The vaccines worked well and are thought to have saved millions of lives. Related StorymRNA vaccines just won a Nobel Prize. Now they\u2019re ready for the next act.Scientists hope to leverage mRNA for a bevy of vaccines and therapeutics.",
    "The US government played an important role in the introduction of these vaccines, providing $18 billion to support their development as part of Operation Warp Speed. But now, that government is turning its back on the technology. Funding is being withdrawn. Partnerships are being canceled. Leaders of US health agencies are casting doubt on the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness and safety. And this week, the director of the National Institutes of Health implied that the reversal was due to a lack of public trust in the technology.",
    "Plenty of claims are being thrown about. Let\u2019s consider the evidence. mRNA is a molecule found in cells that essentially helps DNA make proteins. The vaccines work in a similar way, except they carry genetic instructions for proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus. This can help train our immune systems to tackle the virus itself.",
    "Research into mRNA vaccines has been underway for decades. But things really kicked into gear when the virus behind covid-19 triggered a pandemic in 2020. A huge international effort\u2014along with plenty of funding\u2014fast-tracked research and development. The genetic code for the Sars-CoV-2 virus was sequenced in January 2020. The first vaccines were being administered by the end of that year. That\u2019s wildly fast by pharma standards\u2014drugs can typically spend around a decade in development. And they seemed to work really well. Early trials in tens of thousands of volunteers suggested that Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine conferred \u201c95% protection against covid-19.\u201d No vaccine is perfect, but for a disease that was responsible for millions of deaths, the figures were impressive. Still, there were naysayers. Including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the notorious antivaccine activist who currently leads the US\u2019s health agencies. He\u00a0has called covid vaccines \u201cunsafe and ineffective.\u201d In 2021, he\u00a0petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization for covid vaccines. That same year, Instagram removed his account from the platform\u00a0after he repeatedly shared \u201cdebunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.\u201d Related StoryHow measuring vaccine hesitancy could help health professionals tackle itRFK Jr. is a high-profile face of vaccine hesitancy, but people's vaccine concerns fall on a much broader spectrum.",
    "So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when the US Department of Health and Human Services, which RFK Jr. now heads,\u00a0announced \u201cthe beginning of a coordinated wind-down\u201d of mRNA vaccine development earlier this month. HHS is canceling almost $500 million worth of funding for the technology. \u201cThe data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like covid and flu,\u201d Kennedy said in\u00a0a statement. Well, as we\u2019ve seen, the mRNA covid vaccines were hugely effective during the pandemic. And researchers are working on other mRNA vaccines for infections including flu. Our current flu vaccines aren\u2019t ideal\u2014they are produced slowly in a process that requires hen\u2019s eggs, based on predictions about which flu strains are likely to be prominent in the winter. They\u2019re not all that protective. mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, can be made quickly and cheaply, perhaps once we already know which flu strains we need to protect against. And scientists are making progress with\u00a0universal flu vaccines\u2014drugs that could potentially protect against multiple flu strains. Kennedy\u2019s other claim is that the vaccines aren\u2019t safe. There have certainly been reports of adverse events. Usually these are mild and short-lived\u2014most people will be familiar with the fatigue and flu-like symptoms that can follow a covid jab. But some are more serious: Some people have developed neurological and cardiovascular conditions.",
    "These problems are rare, according to an\u00a0evaluation of adverse outcomes in almost 100 million people who received covid vaccines. Most studies of mRNA vaccines haven\u2019t reported an increase in the risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a condition that affects nerves and has been linked to covid vaccines. Covid vaccines can increase the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men. But the picture isn\u2019t straightforward. Vaccinated individuals appear to have double the risk of myocarditis compared with unvaccinated people. But the overall risk is still low. And it\u2019s still not as high as\u00a0the risk of myocarditis following a covid infection. And then there are the claims that mRNA vaccines don\u2019t have the support of the public. That\u2019s what Jay Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, wrote in\u00a0an opinion piece published in the Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cNo matter how elegant the science, a platform that lacks credibility among the people it seeks to protect cannot fulfill its public health mission,\u201d Bhattacharya wrote. He blamed the Biden administration, which he wrote \u201cdid not manage public trust in the coronavirus vaccines.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting take from someone who played a pretty significant role in undermining public trust in covid policies, including vaccine mandates. In 2020, Bhattacharya coauthored the Great Barrington Declaration\u2014an open letter making the case against lockdowns. He became a vocal critic of US health agencies, including the NIH, and their handling of the outbreak. Unlike Kennedy, Bhattacharya hasn\u2019t called the vaccines unsafe or ineffective. But he\u00a0has called vaccine mandates \u201cunethical.\u201d Curiously, the US government doesn\u2019t seem to be turning away from all vaccine research. Just work on mRNA vaccines. Some of the funding budget originally earmarked for covid vaccines will be redirected to two senior staffers at the NIH who are exploring the use of an old vaccine technology that makes use of inactivated viruses\u2014a move that\u00a0researchers are describing as \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cappalling,\u201d according to reporting by Science. Not all mRNA research is being abandoned, either. Bhattacharya has expressed his support for research into the use of mRNA-based treatments for cancer.\u00a0Such \u201cvaccine therapeutics\u201d were being explored before covid came along. (Notably, Bhattacharya isn\u2019t referring to them as \u201cvaccines.\u201d) It is difficult to predict how this will all shake out for mRNA vaccines. We mustn\u2019t forget that this technology helped save millions of lives and shows huge promise for the development of cheap, effective, and potentially universal vaccines. Let\u2019s hope that the recent upsets won\u2019t prevent it from achieving its potential.
