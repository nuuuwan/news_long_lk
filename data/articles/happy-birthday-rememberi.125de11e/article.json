    "Rajendram Rajamahendran",
    "19 May 2025 marks the 82nd birth anniversary of who I fondly refer to as \u2018the last of Sri Lanka\u2019s Big Men\u2019.",
    "Rajendram Rajamahendran better known as \u2018Killi\u2019 and as \u2018Killi Maharaja\u2019 with the politicians would\u2019ve turned 82.",
    "Sadly, Boss, as he was known to most of us was also a victim of the coronavirus, and his career was cut short considerably.",
    "One can argue that he had at least another decade of contribution to make to the Capital Maharaja Group \u2013 or for the older of us, the Maharaja Organisation.",
    "The group that was formed by his father and his Dad\u2019s friend, and later inherited by Boss and his older brother Maha.",
    "In the current ambiance of \u2018Change\u2019 in Sri Lanka, especially in terms of the political ideology and a drive towards accountability, it would be appropriate to remember the description of one time Governor and legal eagle, President\u2019s Counsel, Maithri Gunaratne who said: \u201cMr. Rajamahendran and his media stables was the real opposition to any government in power.\u201d Holding the Government of the day accountable was a forte perfected by the CMG networks \u2013 in English, Tamil and in Sinhala.",
    "Rajamahendran perhaps, didn\u2019t lack much \u2013 what he had an abundance of was resilience. Only God and maybe his wife \u2013 in that order \u2013 knew of what went on in his mind, when the 1983 riots decimated the Maharaja Organisation with the burning of six factories, and the loss of untold millions of assets.",
    "It was that legendary resilience, the courage to be different and sheer hard work (as President Nasheed of the Maldives correctly put it) that gave the Maharaja Organisation its rebirth. It must have been tough: a wife and three children to protect apart from rebuilding a business literally from scratch. The split in responsibilities was clear: Madam would take care of the home front and Boss would rebuild.",
    "Rajamahendran took it upon himself to rebuild and by Jove did he rebuild! The Maharaja Organisation was rebuilt to be bigger and better than ever before. Today his son oversees one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest privately held conglomerates.",
    "We remember the birth of a truly remarkable son of this soil \u2013 a Sri Lankan by birth, who acknowledged his minority roots with as much pride as a southerner would, building easily the most vociferous broadcasting network and in the process becoming the real peoples\u2019 voice. Other businesses built by Rajamahendran touch the lives of almost every Sri Lankan daily: from milk powder to water to paint to consumer durables to tea to cosmetics to industry to power.",
    "We remember you with love and respect for the man you were to us all.",
