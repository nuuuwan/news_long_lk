To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first,\u00a0sign up here. This week I came across research that suggests aging hits us in waves. You might feel like you\u2019re on a slow, gradual decline, but, at the molecular level, you\u2019re likely to be hit by two waves of changes, according to the scientists behind the work. The first one comes in your 40s. Eek.

    "For the study, Michael Snyder at Stanford University and his colleagues collected a vast amount of biological data from 108 volunteers aged 25 to 75, all of whom were living in California. Their approach was to gather as much information as they could and look for age-related patterns afterward. This approach can lead to some startling revelations, including the one about the impacts of age on 40-year-olds (who, I was horrified to learn this week, are generally considered \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d). It can help us answer some big questions about aging, and even potentially help us find drugs to counter some of the most unpleasant aspects of the process.",
    "But it\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. And midlife needn\u2019t involve falling off a cliff in terms of your well-being. Let\u2019s explore why. First, the study, which was published in the journal Nature Aging on August 14. Snyder and his colleagues collected a real trove of data on their volunteers, including on gene expression, proteins, metabolites, and various other chemical markers. The team also swabbed volunteers\u2019 skin, stool, mouths, and noses to get an idea of the microbial communities that might be living there.",
    "Each volunteer gave up these samples every few months for a median period of 1.7 years, and the team ended up with a total of 5,405 samples, which included over 135,000 biological features. \u201cThe idea is to get a very complete picture of people\u2019s health,\u201d says Snyder. When he and his colleagues analyzed the data, they found that around 7% of the molecules and microbes measured changes gradually over time, in a linear way. On the other hand, 81% of them changed at specific life stages. There seem to be two that are particularly important: one at around the age of 44, and another around the age of 60. Some of the dramatic changes at age 60 seem to be linked to kidney and heart function, and diseases like atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries. That makes sense, given that our risks of developing cardiovascular diseases increase dramatically as we age\u2014around 40% of 40- to 59-year-olds have such disorders, and this figure rises to 75% for 60- to 79-year-olds. Related StoryA test told me my brain and liver are older than they should be. Should I be worried?Aging clocks estimate how fast specific organs are deteriorating\u2014but it\u2019s hard to know what to do with the results.",
    "But the changes that occur around the age of 40 came as a surprise to Snyder. He says that, on reflection, they make intuitive sense. Many of us start to feel a bit creakier once we hit 40, and it can take longer to recover from injuries, for example.  Other changes suggest that our ability to metabolize lipids and alcohol shifts when we reach our 40s, though it\u2019s hard to say why, for a few reasons.\u00a0 First, it\u2019s not clear if a change in alcohol metabolism, for example, means that we are less able to break down alcohol, or if people are just consuming less of it when they\u2019re older. This gets us to a central question about aging: Is it an inbuilt program that sets us on a course of deterioration, or is it merely a consequence of living? We don\u2019t have an answer to that one, yet. It\u2019s probably a combination of both. Our bodies are exposed to various environmental stressors over time. But also, as our cells age, they are less able to divide, and clear out the molecular garbage they accumulate over time.",
    "It\u2019s also hard to tell what\u2019s happening in this study, because the research team didn\u2019t measure more physiological markers of aging, such as muscle strength or frailty, says Colin Selman, a biogerontologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. There\u2019s another, perhaps less scientific, question that comes to mind. How worried should we be about these kinds of molecular changes? I\u2019m approaching 40\u2014should I panic? I asked Sara H\u00e4gg, who studies the molecular epidemiology of aging at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. \u201cNo,\u201d was her immediate answer.

They\u2019re eyeing Rhode Island.Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro has provided a temporary home for people who plan to set up a new jurisdiction to encourage biohacking and fast-track drugs that slow or reverse aging.",
    "While Snyder\u2019s team collected a vast amount of data, it was from a relatively small number of people over a relatively short period of time. None of them were tracked for the two or three decades you\u2019d need to see the two waves of molecular changes occur in a person. \u201cThis is an observational study, and they compare different people,\u201d H\u00e4gg told me. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that this is going to happen to you.\u201d After all, there\u2019s a lot that can happen in a person\u2019s life over 20 or 30 years. They might take up a sport. They might quit smoking or stop eating meat.\u00a0\u00a0  However, the findings do support the idea that aging is not a linear process. \u201cPeople have always suggested that you\u2019re on this decline in your life from [around the age of] 40, depressingly,\u201d says Selman. \u201cBut it\u2019s not quite as simple as that.\u201d Snyder hopes that studies like his will help reveal potential new targets for therapies that help counteract some of the harmful molecular shifts associated with aging. \u201cPeople\u2019s healthspan is 11 to 15 years shorter than their lifespan,\u201d he says. \u201cIdeally you\u2019d want to live for as long as possible [in good health], and then die.\u201d We don\u2019t have any such drugs yet. For now, it all comes down to the age-old advice about eating well, sleeping well, getting enough exercise, and avoiding the big no-nos like smoking and alcohol.",
    "I happened to speak to Selman at the end of what had been a particularly difficult day, and I confessed that I was looking forward to enjoying an evening glass of wine. That\u2019s despite the fact that research suggests that there is \u201cno safe level\u201d of alcohol consumption. \u201cA little bit of alcohol is actually quite nice,\u201d Selman agreed. He told me about an experience he\u2019d had once at a conference on aging. Some of the attendees were members of a society that practiced caloric restriction\u2014the idea being that cutting your calories can boost your lifespan (we don\u2019t yet know if this works for people). \u201cThere was a big banquet\u2026 and these people all had little scales, and were weighing their salads on the scales,\u201d he told me. \u201cTo me, that seems like a rather miserable way to live your life.\u201d",
    "I\u2019m all for finding balance between healthy lifestyle choices and those that bring me joy. And it\u2019s worth remembering that no amount of deprivation is going to radically extend our lifespans. As Selman puts it: \u201cWe can do certain things, but ultimately, when your time\u2019s up, your time\u2019s up.\u201d  Now read the rest of the Checkup Read more from MIT Technology Review's archive We don\u2019t yet have a drug that targets aging. But that hasn\u2019t stopped a bunch of longevity clinics from cropping up, offering a range of purported healthspan-extending services for the mega-rich. Now, they\u2019re on a quest to legitimize longevity medicine.  Speaking of the uber wealthy, I also tagged along to an event for longevity enthusiasts ready to pump millions of dollars into the search for an anti-aging therapy. It was a fascinating, albeit slightly strange, experience. There are plenty of potential rejuvenation strategies being explored right now. But the one that has received some of the most attention\u2014and the most investment\u2014is cellular reprogramming. My colleague Antonio Regalado looked at the promise of the field in this feature. Scientists are working on new ways to measure how old a person is. Not just the number of birthdays they\u2019ve had, but how aged or close to death they are. I took one of these biological aging tests. And I wasn\u2019t all that pleased with the result. Is there a limit to human life? Is old age a disease?
