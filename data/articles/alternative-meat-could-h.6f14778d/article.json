    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Last week, we celebrated Thanksgiving here in the US, and I had hearty helpings of ham and turkey alongside my mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.  Meat is often the star on our plates, but our love of animal-based foods is a problem for the climate. Depending on how you count it up, livestock accounts for somewhere between 10% and 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions. A growing number of alternative foods seek to mimic or replace options that require raising and slaughtering animals. These include plant-based products and newly approved cultivated (or lab-grown) meats. An increasing number of companies are even raising microbes in the lab in the hopes that we\u2019ll add them to the menu, as I covered in a story this week.",
    "But as one of my colleagues always puts it when I tell him about some alternative food product, the key question is, will anyone eat it? Food might just be one of the trickiest climate problems to solve. Technically, none of us has to be eating any of the highest-emissions foods\u2014like beef\u2014that are worst for the climate. But what we eat is deeply personal, and it\u2019s often tied up with our culture and our social lives. Many people want hamburgers at a barbecue and nice steak dinners.",
    "The challenge of our food system\u2019s climate impact is only getting more tricky: richer countries tend to eat more meat, and so as populations grow and the standard of living rises around the world, we\u2019re going to see emissions from livestock production rise, too. In an effort to combat that trend, alternative food products aim to deliver foods similar to the ones we know and love with less harmful effects on the climate. Plant-based options like those from Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have exploded in recent years, finding their way into supermarkets and even onto the menus of major fast-food brands like Burger King. The problem is, a lot of alternative products have been struggling lately. Unit sales of meat alternatives in the US were down by 26% between 2021 and 2023, and fewer households are buying plant-based alternative meat options, according to a report from the Good Food Institute. Consumers say that alternatives still aren\u2019t up to par on taste and price, two key factors that determine what people decide to eat. So companies are racing to invent better products. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time covering cultivated (or lab-grown) meats. To make these products, animal cells are grown in the lab and processed into things like chicken nuggets. Two companies got approval to sell cultivated chicken in the US in 2023, and we\u2019ve seen both offer their products in limited runs at high-end restaurants.  But these products are still not quite the same thing as the meat we\u2019re used to. When I tried a burger that contained cells grown in a lab, it was similar to plant-based ones that have a softer texture than I\u2019m used to. Chicken from Upside Foods, served at a Michelin-starred restaurant, had similar textural differences. And these products are still only available at very small scales, if at all, and they\u2019re expensive.\u00a0  LANZATECH   One key issue that comes up again and again as I report on these new products is what to call them. The industry strongly prefers cultivated, not \u201clab-grown.\u201d Probably better to not remind people that they\u2019re eating something grown in vats in a laboratory. As the companies that make these products often point out, we don\u2019t typically use this sort of language for the animal-based products we\u2019re used to. You\u2019d never find the phrase \u201cslaughtered baby cow\u201d on a menu, just \u201cveal.\u201d I was thinking about this issue of language and marketing again recently as I reported a story about a company looking to grow bacteria, dry it, and sell it to feed animals or people. I found myself a little weirded out by the prospect of dried microbe powder finding its way into my diet. But I don\u2019t have a problem drinking wine or eating cheese, two products that rely on microbes and a fermentation process to exist. Maybe LanzaTech will come up with a marketing plan that makes their microbe powder\u00a0 an easy addition to my Thanksgiving table. Ultimately though, no matter how well they\u2019re marketed, I\u2019m not sure how much we can rely on alternative products to solve the climate challenge that is our food system.",
    "As is often the case when it comes to addressing climate change, we\u2019re going to need not only some behavioral changes, but also technical solutions like cattle burp pills and new fertilizer options, as well as policy to help nudge our food system in the right direction.\u00a0  Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading A new crop of biotech startups is looking to grow food out of thin air.
