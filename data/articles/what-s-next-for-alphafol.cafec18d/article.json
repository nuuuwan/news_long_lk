    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2017, fresh off a PhD on theoretical chemistry, John Jumper heard rumors that Google DeepMind had moved on from building AI that played games with superhuman skill and was starting up a secret project to predict the structures of proteins. He applied for a job. Just three years later, Jumper celebrated a stunning win that few had seen coming. With CEO Demis Hassabis, he had co-led the development of an AI system called AlphaFold 2 that was able to predict the structures of proteins to within the width of an atom, matching the accuracy of painstaking techniques used in the lab, and doing it many times faster\u2014returning results in hours instead of months.  AlphaFold 2 had cracked a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology. \u201cThis is the reason I started DeepMind,\u201d Hassabis told me a few years ago. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve worked my whole career in AI.\u201d In 2024, Jumper and Hassabis shared a Nobel Prize in chemistry. It was five years ago this week that AlphaFold 2\u2019s debut took scientists by surprise. Now that the hype has died down, what impact has AlphaFold really had? How are scientists using it? And what\u2019s next? I talked to Jumper (as well as a few other scientists) to find out.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinary five years,\u201d Jumper says, laughing: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember a time before I knew tremendous numbers of journalists.\u201d AlphaFold 2 was followed by AlphaFold Multimer, which could predict structures that contained more than one protein, and then AlphaFold 3, the fastest version yet. Google DeepMind also let AlphaFold loose on UniProt, a vast protein database used and updated by millions of researchers around the world. It has now predicted the structures of some 200 million proteins, almost all that are known to science.",
    "Despite his success, Jumper remains modest about AlphaFold\u2019s achievements. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re certain of everything in there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a database of predictions, and it comes with all the caveats of predictions.\u201d A hard problem Proteins are the biological machines that make living things work. They form muscles, horns, and feathers; they carry oxygen around the body and ferry messages between cells; they fire neurons, digest food, power the immune system; and so much more. But understanding exactly what a protein does (and what role it might play in various diseases or treatments) involves figuring out its structure\u2014and that\u2019s hard. Related StoryDeepMind\u2019s protein-folding AI has solved a 50-year-old grand challenge of biologyRead next Proteins are made from strings of amino acids that chemical forces twist up into complex knots. An untwisted string gives few clues about the structure it will form. In theory, most proteins could take on an astronomical number of possible shapes. The task is to predict the correct one. Jumper and his team built AlphaFold 2 using a type of neural network called a transformer, the same technology that underpins large language models. Transformers are very good at paying attention to specific parts of a larger puzzle.  But Jumper puts a lot of the success down to making a prototype model that they could test quickly. \u201cWe got a system that would give wrong answers at incredible speed,\u201d he says. \u201cThat made it easy to start becoming very adventurous with the ideas you try.\u201d Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdAn industry I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI. They stuffed the neural network with as much information about protein structures as they could, such as how proteins across certain species have evolved similar shapes. And it worked even better than they expected. \u201cWe were sure we had made a breakthrough,\u201d says Jumper. \u201cWe were sure that this was an incredible advance in ideas.\u201d What he hadn\u2019t foreseen was that researchers would download his software and start using it straight away for so many different things. Normally, it\u2019s the thing a few iterations down the line that has the real impact, once the kinks have been ironed out, he says: \u201cI\u2019ve been shocked at how responsibly scientists have used it, in terms of interpreting it, and using it in practice about as much as it should be trusted in my view, neither too much nor too little.\u201d Any projects stand out in particular?",
    "Honeybee science Jumper brings up a research group that uses AlphaFold to study disease resistance in honeybees. \u201cThey wanted to understand this particular protein as they look at things like colony collapse,\u201d he says. \u201cI never would have said, \u2018You know, of course AlphaFold will be used for honeybee science.\u2019\u201d Related StoryThis is the reason Demis Hassabis started DeepMindRead next He also highlights a few examples of what he calls off-label uses of AlphaFold\u2014\u201cin the sense that it wasn\u2019t guaranteed to work\u201d\u2014where the ability to predict protein structures has opened up new research techniques. \u201cThe first is very obviously the advances in protein design,\u201d he says. \u201cDavid Baker and others have absolutely run with this technology.\u201d Baker, a computational biologist at the University of Washington, was a co-winner of last year\u2019s chemistry Nobel, alongside Jumper and Hassabis, for his work on creating synthetic proteins to perform specific tasks\u2014such as treating disease or breaking down plastics\u2014better than natural proteins can. Baker and his colleagues have developed their own tool based on AlphaFold, called RoseTTAFold. But they have also experimented with AlphaFold Multimer to predict which of their designs for potential synthetic proteins will work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cBasically, if AlphaFold confidently agrees with the structure you were trying to design then you make it and if AlphaFold says \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 you don\u2019t make it. That alone was an enormous improvement.\u201d It can make the design process 10 times faster, says Jumper. Another off-label use that Jumper highlights: Turning AlphaFold into a kind of search engine. He mentions two separate research groups that were trying to understand exactly how human sperm cells hooked up with eggs during fertilization. They knew one of the proteins involved but not the other, he says: \u201cAnd so they took a known egg protein and ran all 2,000 human sperm surface proteins, and they found one that AlphaFold was very sure stuck against the egg.\u201d They were then able to confirm this in the lab. \u201cThis notion that you can use AlphaFold to do something you couldn\u2019t do before\u2014you would never do 2,000 structures looking for one answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThis kind of thing I think is really extraordinary.\u201d Five years on When AlphaFold 2 came out, I asked a handful of early adopters what they made of it. Reviews were good, but the technology was too new to know for sure what long-term impact it might have. I caught up with one of those people to hear his thoughts five years on.",
    "Related StoryAI is dreaming up drugs that no one has ever seen. Now we've got to see if they work.Read next Kliment Verba is a molecular biologist who runs a lab at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly useful technology, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe use it every day, all the time.\u201d But it\u2019s far from perfect. A lot of scientists use AlphaFold to study pathogens or to develop drugs. This involves looking at interactions between multiple proteins or between proteins and even smaller molecules in the body. But AlphaFold is known to be less accurate at making predictions about multiple proteins or their interaction over time.",
    "Verba says he and his colleagues have been using AlphaFold long enough to get used to its limitations. \u201cThere are many cases where you get a prediction and you have to kind of scratch your head,\u201d he says. \u201cIs this real or is this not? It\u2019s not entirely clear\u2014it\u2019s sort of borderline.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same thing as ChatGPT,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou know\u2014it will bullshit you with the same confidence as it would give a true answer.\u201d  Still, Verba\u2019s team uses AlphaFold (both 2 and 3, because they have different strengths, he says) to run virtual versions of their experiments before running them in the lab. Using AlphaFold\u2019s results, they can narrow down the focus of an experiment\u2014or decide that it\u2019s not worth doing. It can really save time, he says: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really replaced any experiments, but it\u2019s augmented them quite a bit.\u201d New wave\u00a0\u00a0 AlphaFold was designed to be used for a range of purposes. Now multiple startups and university labs are building on its success to develop a new wave of tools more tailored to drug discovery. This year, a collaboration between MIT researchers and the AI drug company Recursion produced a model called Boltz-2, which predicts not only the structure of proteins but also how well potential drug molecules will bind to their target.\u00a0\u00a0 Related StoryWhat is AI?Read next Last month, the startup Genesis Molecular AI released another structure prediction model called Pearl, which the firm claims is more accurate than AlphaFold 3 for certain queries that are important for drug development. Pearl is interactive, so that drug developers can feed any additional data they may have to the model to guide its predictions.",
    "AlphaFold was a major leap, but there\u2019s more to do, says Evan Feinberg, Genesis Molecular AI\u2019s CEO: \u201cWe\u2019re still fundamentally innovating, just with a better starting point than before.\u201d Genesis Molecular AI is pushing margins of error down from less than two angstroms, the de facto industry standard set by AlphaFold, to less than one angstrom\u2014one 10-millionth of a millimeter, or the width of a single hydrogen atom. \u201cSmall errors can be catastrophic for predicting how well a drug will actually bind to its target,\u201d says Michael LeVine, vice president of modeling and simulation at the firm. That\u2019s because chemical forces that interact at one angstrom can stop doing so at two. \u201cIt can go from \u2018They will never interact\u2019 to \u2018They will,\u2019\u201d he says. With so much activity in this space, how soon should we expect new types of drugs to hit the market? Jumper is pragmatic. Protein structure prediction is just one step of many, he says: \u201cThis was not the only problem in biology. It\u2019s not like we were one protein structure away from curing any diseases.\u201d",
    "Think of it this way, he says. Finding a protein\u2019s structure might previously have cost $100,000 in the lab: \u201cIf we were only a hundred thousand dollars away from doing a thing, it would already be done.\u201d At the same time, researchers are looking for ways to do as much as they can with this technology, says Jumper: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how to make structure prediction an even bigger part of the problem, because we have a nice big hammer to hit it with.\u201d In other words, make everything into nails? \u201cYeah, let\u2019s make things into nails,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do we make this thing that we made a million times faster a bigger part of our process?\u201d What\u2019s next? Jumper\u2019s next act? He wants to fuse the deep but narrow power of AlphaFold with the broad sweep of LLMs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have machines that can read science. They can do some scientific reasoning,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we can build amazing, superhuman systems for protein structure prediction. How do you get these two technologies to work together?\u201d That makes me think of a system called AlphaEvolve, which is being built by another team at Google DeepMind. AlphaEvolve uses an LLM to generate possible solutions to a problem and a second model to check them, filtering out the trash. Researchers have already used AlphaEvolve to make a handful of practical discoveries in math and computer science.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is that what Jumper has in mind? \u201cI won\u2019t say too much on methods, but I\u2019ll be shocked if we don\u2019t see more and more LLM impact on science,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the exciting open question that I\u2019ll say almost nothing about. This is all speculation, of course.\u201d Jumper was 39 when he won his Nobel Prize. What\u2019s next for him? \u201cIt worries me,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe I\u2019m the youngest chemistry laureate in 75 years.\u201d\u00a0 He adds: \u201cI\u2019m at the midpoint of my career, roughly. I guess my approach to this is to try to do smaller things, little ideas that you keep pulling on. The next thing I announce doesn\u2019t have to be, you know, my second shot at a Nobel. I think that\u2019s the trap.\u201d hide"
