Just as archers break the skill of using a bow and arrow to hit a target from distance into component parts, such as stance or aim, executives can break the task of \u201cbecoming a better leader\u201d into specific, actionable, and manageable steps. Just as archers are taught to\u00a0concentrate intensely and channel all their energy into the perfect shot through rigorous mental training, including meditation and self-talk, businesspeople can use similar techniques to develop transformative focus. Just as archers practice visualization and cognitive reframing to manage stress and maintain composure in challenging situations, leaders can also use scenario planning and self-talk to become more resilient. Finally, just as archers to develop their ability to adapt to varying conditions\u2014wind, light, and even their physical and mental state on a given moment or day\u2014executives can try similar exercises to better prepare for the unexpected.",
