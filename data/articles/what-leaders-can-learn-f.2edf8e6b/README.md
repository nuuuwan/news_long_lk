The discipline of archery, with training that emphasizes purposeful practice, mindful focus, mental toughness, and adaptability, offers useful lessons for business leaders. Just as archers break the skill of using a bow and arrow to hit a target from distance into component parts, such as stance or aim, executives can break the task of “becoming a better leader” into specific, actionable, and manageable steps. Just as archers are taught to concentrate intensely and channel all their energy into the perfect shot through rigorous mental training, including meditation and self-talk, businesspeople can use similar techniques to develop transformative focus. Just as archers practice visualization and cognitive reframing to manage stress and maintain composure in challenging situations, leaders can also use scenario planning and self-talk to become more resilient. Finally, just as archers to develop their ability to adapt to varying conditions—wind, light, and even their physical and mental state on a given moment or day—executives can try similar exercises to better prepare for the unexpected.

Of the many Olympic sports showcased in Paris this month, archery is not the most popular or widely watched. However, the discipline, with its emphasis on purposeful practice, mindful focus, mental toughness, and adaptability, provides some valuable lessons for today’s business leaders.
