A reader’s letter to the editor of the Daily FT has sharply criticised the former President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming his mismanagement - notably of SriLankan Airlines - led to huge financial waste. The writer accuses Rajapaksa of using SriLankan Airlines for personal travel at public expense, including chartering a plane to the Caribbean to watch the cricket World Cup, and also bending the rules to enable his son to attend a prestigious postgraduate institution. The President also sacked CEO Peter Hill for refusing to book him a business class ticket back home that went against International Air Transport Association guidelines, leading to the eventual departure of SriLankan Airlines’ partner, Emirates. The writer suggests these acts of vanity contributed to the crippling of a profitable airline.
