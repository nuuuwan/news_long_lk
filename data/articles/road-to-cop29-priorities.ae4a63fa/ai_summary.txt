2️⃣ Developing nations, grappling with mounting debt and supply chain disruptions, will confront the challenges of balancing climate initiatives with domestic and developmental needs. 🌐💰

4️⃣ Climate finance pledged by developed countries in 2015 amounted to $100 billion annually from 2020 onwards, the COP29 aims to agree on a significant increase in this amount. 👀📈
