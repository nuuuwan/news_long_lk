The Sri Lankan government is being urged to create 250,000 new university and vocational training opportunities to stop the decline of the country’s youth. Over the years, many of Sri Lanka’s youth have been forced to take on unskilled work and abandon their education, either due to lack of opportunity or the high cost of further education. Creating more training opportunities, challenging the monopoly of the privileged on higher education and making tertiary education compulsory are measures suggested to tackle this situation. The writer also suggests that if the domestic economy continues to falter and unskilled work is the only option, those with a higher education will at least be able to make a decent living abroad. Critics argue this long-standing issue is generally ignored because advocating for change is not politically beneficial.
