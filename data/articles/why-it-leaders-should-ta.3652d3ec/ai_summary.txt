Most organisations fail to tap into the potential of their data and as a result miss significant opportunities for smarter business decisions, highlighted by the fact that 80% of industrial data goes unused. Many fear the governance and security implications of wider organisational access. However, a new model dubbed the "franchise approach" can enable better use of data. This approach involves IT teams partnering with business units to manage data and scale analytics responsibly. IT leaders then manage the quality of the data while business leaders guide schema development and processes. Effective implementation requires co-signing between IT and business units, crowdsourcing insights from across the organisation, and scaling data functions based on feedback.
