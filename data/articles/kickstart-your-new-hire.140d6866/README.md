As a manager, onboarding a new hire isn’t just about providing manuals and login information, it’s about setting the employee up to operate autonomously in their role and feel comfortable within the organization. To do this, leaders need to emphasize the...more

A standard operating procedure for onboarding is to front-load new employees with presentations and written resources, such as handbooks, e-learning modules, or manuals. These can be helpful — but only to a point. Learning new processes and navigating new environments is not just about content acquisition. Much of your organization’s important knowledge and expertise resides in people, and not all companies are tapping into this valuable resource. One study found that 20% of employees reported that their company didn’t do anything to facilitate networking between them and their coworkers.

New employees who haven’t had a chance to develop sufficient strategic relationships may struggle to integrate into your organization. They often don’t know who to turn to for relevant information, may not feel confident enough to contribute in meetings, may demonstrate a slower than expected learning curve, or show overall low levels of engagement.

This isn’t just about cultivating office friendships (those are certainly valuable); it’s about helping employees engage in internal networking to cultivate connections with allies who can provide information, relevant resources, and support. Those who form these relationships benefit from the facilitated sharing of ideas and expertise, improved communication, and greater opportunities for innovation and collaboration. Longer-term, establishing connections with co-workers boosts learning, productivity, job embeddedness, sense of belonging, engagement, and retention.

As a leader, rather than overloading a new employee with passively consumed information, consider emphasizing the importance of developing strategic relationships with people who can share critical knowledge, and help contextualize and speed up their learning.

Here are three steps you, as a manager, can take to help new employees build these beneficial relationships.

Create a Knowledge Map

It’s important for your new employee to understand who knows what within your company and how all the people and groups fit together. Creating a knowledge map (like this one, for example) as a resource is a great way to accelerate that understanding. Here are three tips to create your map:

1. Revamp your existing org chart.

An org chart typically includes individual roles and the hierarchical structure of your company. To turn it into a knowledge map, add in photographs, and areas of expertise, achievements, skills, talents. Including photographs helps new employees quickly put a face to a name and title and builds familiarity and recognition of those within the company that are not in their immediate team. Including information about people’s skills — not just title or role — helps new employees more easily identify the resident project management software expert or the go-to person in charge of optimizing content for SEO. The annotated map should make clear the functions of different departments and highlight how groups interact and are connected.

2. Use AI to help with this task.

AI-driven platforms can analyze huge amounts of data from across your organization from resumes, project work, job descriptions, performance reviews, 360-degree feedback, and skills endorsements from peers to help populate your knowledge map.

Make sure you check your company’s AI usage policy (if there is one) and verify your company’s list of approved AI-based tools. Some organizations require employees to inform their supervisor or document if they used AI to help perform a task. There may also be protocols for uploading personal data into AI-platforms.

3. Crowdsource information.

Other people within your organization may know certain people or certain teams better than you do. You might also consider a quick survey asking employees to provide their skills and expertise. The results can be imported into your map.

Create a Prioritized Networking List

Once you have created your map, the next step is to ask yourself, “Who does my new employee need to know to help support their learning and integration into their new role?” Some people on your map are going to be more relevant to specific tasks or topic areas than others. The key here is to be selective, strategic, and intentional and create a prioritized list of people your new employee should meet first.

Your goal is not for new employees to meet everyone from the knowledge map as soon as possible. (There will be other opportunities for broader socializing.)  For instance, if you’re hiring Lauren, a new product lead, you can identify the first five people she needs to meet — e.g., VP of marketing, the customer support lead, a member of the design team, the head of sales, and the chief technology officer — and let her know these are the people she is going to need to collaborate and communicate with first. When people know and trust someone personally, they’re likely to work together more effectively and will also feel more comfortable asking questions, proposing innovative ideas, or embracing the learning opportunities in mistakes.

Initiate Relationship Building

Now that you have a prioritized list of people you want your new employee to get to know, it’s important (at least in the beginning) to help facilitate access to these connections. New employees are likely a little overwhelmed, and some might be shy or hesitant to contact people out of the blue. You can smooth the way by initiating and encouraging strategic connections with people on your list.

For example, instead of asking new employees to read all the information about the new sales-tracking software in a manual or online course, connect your new employee with an expert user, who knows the software and which aspects are most important to understand first, and which can be saved for later. Once the connection has been made, your new employee is likely to feel more comfortable leveraging their relationship with the expert as an ongoing resource for questions that may come up down the road.

Here are more tips for facilitating these connections:

Schedule a lunch meeting and invite both the new employee and the person you want them to connect with. This initial meeting can serve as an organizational “permission slip” for future interactions.

Give existing employees the heads up that new people will be reaching out. For example, you might let Andrea in marketing know that a new team member, Nigel, will be contacting her to set up an exploratory meeting to go over some of the lessons learned from recent social media campaigns. And if Nigel doesn’t reach out, Andrea should know to connect with him to set up a chat.

As a follow up, periodically ask new employees to list the co-workers with whom they’ve met and learned from. You can then look at the list to identify and close any obvious gaps in their relationship network.

If new hires are struggling to integrate, rather than piling on more formal training, consider how you can leverage the power of the people within your company to support their learning. As a manager there are strategies you can implement to provide organization-specific information and resources to help new employees build a meaningful network. People within this network are uniquely positioned to provide essential context and serve as ongoing resources of knowledge.
