I\u2019ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump.\u00a0  Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various \u201chouses\u201d\u2014mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there\u2019s one for science and another for AI.\u00a0 But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare,\u00a0C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.",

On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips, and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can\u00a0watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.\u00a0\u00a0 Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing health-care practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me, as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I\u2019ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about his company\u2019s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.",
    "To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won\u2019t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That\u2019s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)\u00a0 But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was a comment from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to trust something until you understand it.\u201d\u00a0 I felt that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.\u00a0 Clearly, other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside, I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd.\u00a0Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.\u00a0 (A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel called \u201cCreativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes,\u201d led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson; it featured the artist Emi Kusano, who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center of a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I\u2019m not going to spend much time describing it because I\u2019m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel.\u00a0Check it out.) And, okay. Sigh. Donald Trump.\u00a0 The president is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he\u2019s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It\u2019s wild.\u00a0 These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.",
    "Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity\u2014after all, captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.\u00a0 But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even front-runner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I\u2019ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I\u2019ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.\u00a0 Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows \u201cthe law of the jungle, the rule of Don\u201d and compared him to a T-Rex, saying, \u201cYou mate with him or he devours you.\u201d And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them \u201cpathetic\u201d and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.\u00a0 Yikes. There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian prime minister Mark Carney during\u00a0his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. \u201cIf we\u2019re not at the table, we\u2019re on the menu,\u201d he argued.\u00a0 hide"
