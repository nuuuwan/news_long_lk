This can pose a dilemma for executives, as research both shows that fast decision-making is vital, but some circumstances require deliberation and care. Interviews with 16 leaders from 10 companies who faced pressure to exit Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine offer six lessons for organizations facing similar situations: 1.
