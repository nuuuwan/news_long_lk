Net Promoter Scores (NPS), a tool used for two decades to measure customer satisfaction, has recently been paired with another metric, Customer Surplus Value (CSV). CSV measures the potential profitability of a product or service by calculating the difference between what a customer might pay and the actual price. By using both the NPS and CSV, companies can gain insight into customer loyalty and demand. The combination of these metrics also provides a more nuanced understanding of customer value. One such company using this combination is LinkedIn, which has found it beneficial for determining customer retention and value perception. 

However, while CSV has proven useful, it doesn't translate directly to optimal pricing strategies. Despite this, for managers, understanding customer feedback is crucial, and CSV provides a valuable method for measuring customer value.
