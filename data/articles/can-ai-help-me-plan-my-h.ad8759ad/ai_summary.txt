1.  🎊 The author is planning her honeymoon, and decides to use AI to assist in her travel planning.
2. 🌏 She uses an AI chatbot called ChatGPT to suggest a travel itinerary for three weeks in Japan and the Philippines.
3. 🏄‍♀️ChatGPT's suggestions are mostly useful and align with her previous research, such as recommending a visit to Siargao Island in the Philippines, which she had already considered.
4. 🚩Conversely, for locations she was already familiar with, such as Tokyo, the AI's suggestions were more commonly known tourist destinations, which she found less impressive.
5. 🔄 However, the author noted that the more specific her prompts to the AI, the better the suggestions were.
6. 🤖 While AIs can provide decent recommendations, they lack the understanding of experiences and time, as demonstrated by the chatbot suggesting spending an entire day taking photos.
7. 💸 The AI's suggestions also didn't take into account factors like budgeting, as it recommended accommodations that were out of the author's price range.
8. 🔄 These limitations may improve with the development of the next generation of AI models, which could be more tailored to individual preferences and even make reservations on behalf of the user.
9. 🔊 The author also discusses research on AI and robots using sound to understand their surroundings and perform tasks more efficiently.
10. 🤔 Despite the limitations, the author suggests that AI assistance in travel planning could still be a viable option in the future, perhaps by their 10th anniversary trip.
