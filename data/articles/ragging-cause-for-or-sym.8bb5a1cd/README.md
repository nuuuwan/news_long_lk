Ragging is a complex issue that cannot be isolated from many other difficulties undergone by students and from the issues in higher education

Universities face many issues starting from irregularities and delays in a complicated system of university intake, and spreading over lack of infrastructure facilities, IT skills, English language proficiency and leadership; outdated syllabuses and course contents; over emphasis of pedagogical aspects; inadequate quality and irrelevant research output; unemployable graduate output; absence of an international face and industry representation plus many more issues in addition to inhuman ragging. A student dream is not shattered only by brutal ragging. The entire higher education system is a quagmire

Let me start with a multiple-choice question (MCQ) for you to choose the best answer.

Question: Who is responsible for university ragging?

Answers: a) Society, b) Ministry, c) UGC, d) VC, e) Management, f) Academia, g) Media, h) Parents, i) Students

There have been articles written, discussions held, and statements issued by varying personnel about university ragging after the recent tragic death of a second-year student at Sabaragamuwa University. The President has issued a strong condemnation of ragging in Sri Lanka’s universities, calling it an outdated and criminal practice that must be eradicated from the country’s higher education system. Many others have joined the chorus and stressed that students found guilty should be severely punished.

No doubt, ragging has become brutal, intolerable, and criminal. No civilised person or a responsible citizen would condone ragging of any nature. There is no argument that whoever is found guilty should be punished. Wherever it originated and in whatever form it takes, ragging is unacceptable. Considering its inhuman nature, ragging needs to be eradicated.

Dream of Sir Ivor Jennings

Sir Ivor Jennings, in his inaugural speech during the opening of the University of Ceylon at Peradeniya, stressed that the role of a university is “to train young men and women who are capable of fulfilling any function in the world that may fall to their lot, citizens of high intelligence, complete moral integrity, and possessing energy, initiative, judgment, tact and qualities of leadership”.

What happened, during the 70 years since then? The number of universities has increased from 1 to 16. A considerable number of centres, schools and institutes have been established under all 16 universities for specialised disciplines. I.e. University of Colombo School of Computing, Post Graduate Institute of Management, Post Graduate Institute of Agriculture, Post Graduate Institute of Science, Post Graduate Institute of Archeology. Despite the increase in number, universities were able to absorb less than 25% of a total of 177,588 students qualified for university admission in 2024. After leaving the university with a degree, students are seen on the street demanding Government employment. According to Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Sri Lankan universities have consistently been outperformed by numerous countries. Universities are ranked based on their research, teaching, knowledge transfer, international outlook and overall academic reputation.

Has the dream of Ivor Jennings realised or fizzled out in the mist of the Hantana Mountains or diluted into the Mahaveli River water? Seventy years after its establishment, is there anything the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya) can be proud of other than “Maname,” the play by Late Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra, produced in 1956, two years after its opening?

Prof. Anusha Cooray, in her article to Daily FT on ‘Dark reality of ragging in Sri Lankan universities: Betrayal of hope’, states, “For thousands of Sri Lankan students, gaining admission to a university is a moment of triumph—the result of years of hard work, sleepless nights, and steadfast pursuit. They enter these institutions with dreams of knowledge, growth, and a future filled with promise. Yet, for many, this dream is swiftly shattered by the brutal reality of ragging”.

2. Is the dream shattered by ragging?

Students enter universities with dreams of knowledge, growth, and a future filled with promise. But, is ragging the only issue confronted by Sri Lankan universities and students? Universities face many issues starting from irregularities and delays in a complicated system of university intake, and spreading over lack of infrastructure facilities, IT skills, English language proficiency and leadership; outdated syllabuses and course contents; over emphasis of pedagogical aspects; inadequate quality and irrelevant research output; unemployable graduate output; absence of an international face and industry representation plus many more issues in addition to inhuman ragging. A student dream is not shattered only by brutal ragging. The entire higher education system is a quagmire. Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, speaking in Parliament as the Education Minister, stated that the prevailing higher education system should be reformed rapidly.

COPE has recommended to the Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Training to appoint an independent committee to investigate the corruption and malpractices of Sabaragamuwa University. Is it ironic, accidental, or coincidental that the death of a victim of ragging took place in the same university?

3. In search of a solution

When ragging takes place, the media, the Ministry, the UGC, and the opinion makers get jittery and excited and start shouting that strong punitive action should be taken against the students responsible for ragging. When a death is caused due to ragging, the situation gets worse. Then, we all forget about ragging and its repercussions and go back to our routine until another death caused by ragging is reported. It’s time that a careful study is conducted to find out multiple reasons behind ragging and take measures to make a full stop to ragging permanently.

The university and the higher education system are afflicted with abundant issues involving not only the students but also other players within and outside the system. Can ragging be isolated from other issues woven around it, and a solution be sought?

In search of an answer, I perused a few articles and research papers produced by scholars and reflected on my exposure as a university student, as an assistant and a visiting lecturer, and as a University Council member.

Interestingly, the Minister in charge of university education today is a former member of the university academic community and a person who joined protest marches to agitate against the deficiencies in universities. And one of her first moves was the removal of a Vice Chancellor (VC) who eradicated ragging in his university, responding to a demand of striking academic, non-academic, and student unions.

4. Psychological, sociological, economic and political dimensions of ragging

Shenali D. Waduge in her article on “From classrooms to coffins: The human cost of ragging in Sri Lanka’s universities” states: “The persistence of ragging in Sri Lankan universities is a multifaceted issue that intertwines socio-economic backgrounds & political affiliations resulting in an institutional culture. Understanding this complex cycle is crucial to formulating a plan to eradicate ragging from the university system.”

“Majority of Sri Lanka’s university entrants come from marginalised socioeconomic & educational backgrounds. They are from rural & economically disadvantaged homes. Their parents toil to send them an allowance to live. Their limitations are a breeding ground for feelings of inferiority & asserting dominance over others is the only way they feel they can become superior”. (https://www.shenaliwaduge.com/from-classrooms-to-coffins-the-human-cost-of-ragging-in-sri-lankas-universities/)

Gamage, Siri, (2017), in his article on “Psychological, Sociological and Political Dimensions of Ragging in Sri Lankan Universities” says: ‘Those from lower socio-economic and rural backgrounds see those from well-to-do families and urban schools or with western outlooks in behaviour (dress, hair style, English language ability, social contacts, etc.) as class enemies who needed to be tamed and put in their place.’ (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321808559_PSYCHOLOGICAL_SOCIOLOGICAL_AND_POLITICAL_DIMENSIONS_OF_RAGGING_IN_SRI_LANKAN_UNIVERSITIES)

Ayanthi.wickramasinghe, Birgitta Essén, Jill Trenholm & Pia Axemo of Uppsala University have conducted a comprehensive study on University Ragging and published online: 23 Jun 2023 under the heading ‘I don’t know how we can stop ragging’: a qualitative study on the perceptions of staff and work-affiliated individuals at a Sri Lankan University, on the phenomena of ragging’ (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09584935.2023.2227113#d1e168)

The Study states, “The most prominent feature of this change was seen in the socioeconomic structure of the student composition, due to the higher intake from rural areas. The previous majority of English-speaking urban upper- and upper-middle classes, were replaced by Sinhalese and Tamil-speaking lower classes from lesser privileged backgrounds

These changes and shortcomings have triggered unrest among the students and are believed to contribute to the practice of ragging.

According to some researchers, large disparities within a society can lead to a higher prevalence of ragging, and similar practices, which may be understood as a method of equalisation. The participants saw ragging as the method of levelling the students: One interviewee felt that the students lacked confidence in the competency of certain lecturers.”

In my opinion, Sri Lankan State universities have lost the glory they enjoyed in the past. Student unrest, ragging, and protest marches are usually highlighted for the deterioration. The issue goes much deeper. There are many more factors that caused the deterioration.

Sir Nicholas Attygalle was the Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the University of Ceylon. Then Prime Minister has telephoned and said that he wanted to meet the VC. Attygalle has promptly responded: Yes, Dudley, you can meet me anytime at the university. The next day, students witnessed humble Dudley being driven in his Humber car towards the University Senate building. That was Nicholas Attygalle, the Vice-Chancellor.

Recently, an appointed MP requested the VC of a university to meet him. I was a Council Member of this university. VC ran to meet the MP, leaving his half-eaten lunch behind. The MP had requested the VC to extend the leave granted for a staff member. He has humbly agreed. When I inquired of the VC, his response was ‘I have to protect my position, Mr. Maliyadde’. Another VC, at a Council meeting, told me, Mr. Maliyadde, you don’t understand academic freedom. A few weeks later, UGC removed him for financial fraud.

Another VC appointed me as a visiting lecturer. There was a single good-looking female student for lectures. VC conducted some lectures, while I did the rest. In the final examination, the student answered 3 questions instead of 4 as specified in the question paper. She has written at the end of the paper “Please consider, in marking, that I have answered all questions.” VC, as the examiner has written below the student’s note, “yes, I agree with the student”, and given marks for a distinction pass. The Head of the Department appointed me as an independent examiner. The student has got barely a pass mark. I was discontinued as a visiting lecturer.

Recently, the UGC requested me to conduct inquiries against 2 VCs on some fraudulent financial transactions. I declined.

6. University academics then and now

During our university days, all teachers were present on the campus from morning till dusk. There was a close relationship between academics and students. We were known by names and even by our nicknames. Today, academics are more absent than present on the university premises. Auditor General has repeatedly made inquiries as to why an attendance register is not maintained for academic staff. Some academics are busy with private work. They love to coordinate fee levying programs. Some universities employ temporary and visiting lecturers to conduct lectures.

There was only one Professor for a subject. He was the Chair-Professor. UGC, with its wisdom, has issued Establishment Circular Letter No 08/2021 explaining about appointing Professors. There are ‘Professor in…’ and ‘Professor of…’ Chair Professor is a ‘Professor of…’ appointed by advertisement to select the best qualified. ‘Professor in…’is merit promoted. More often than not, promotions are made on subjective decisions.

A university once called for applications for a post of Chair-Professor. There were two applicants. One was from the same university, and the other was from another university. I was a member of the selection panel. The performance of the second applicant was outstanding, and the selection panel was convinced that he was the ideal candidate. But there was one hitch. ‘Can we disregard our own man’? I disagreed. University has decided to re-advertise. The same two applied; the same procedure was followed. There was one change. I was not included in the selection Panel.

A VC once mentioned that he requested Deans of Faculties of Arts, Science, and Technology to work out a combined Degree program for arts graduates. The immediate response of the Deans was, “Who will read out the names of combined degree graduates during the convocation, sir?”

7. Ragging starts even before entering the universities

Some suggest ragging starts even before entering the university. The rat race of preparing, sitting, and passing the GCE A Level is a form of ragging. The selection and application process is so cumbersome and lengthy, and worse than ragging. UGC issues a Handbook with guidelines and procedures when applying for university admission. I saw the Handbook issued for the year 2020/2021. It runs to 292 pages. UGC states, “It is your responsibility to carefully read and understand this Handbook and to follow the rules & regulations therein when applying for university admission online as well as getting registered for the selected course of study of the university online. I do not know any other word than ‘Ragging’ to call reading, understanding, and following the rules and regulations in this 292-page handbook.

UGC has enacted the Act, No. 20 of 1998 on Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions. The Act was issued nearly three decades ago. Circumstances have drastically changed since then. The Act mentions penalties for different forms of ragging, but definition of ragging is missing. I do not know how many in the universities have read, gasped, and applied the clauses of it.

8. Need for a holistic solution

Ragging is a complex issue that cannot be isolated from many other difficulties undergone by students and from the issues in higher education. A solution has to come for the overall issue. It is not possible to isolate one issue and tackle it. There should be a holistic approach to the solution.

The Government, the UGC, and universities have issued circulars, introduced measures, and taken action to combat it. They are mostly punitive post-mortem actions against perpetrators who have been reported or caught in the act of ragging. However, ragging continues unabated, and so do the discussions and actions.

The study referred to above by the Uppsala University team concludes, “An integrated action plan on how to reduce ragging should involve all stakeholders such as the politicians, UGC, university administration, lecturers, where student participation is crucial.” I strongly suggest that those who are warming decision-making seats, read this report, at least for pleasure, and take a holistic approach to upscale our university education rather than focusing only on ragging.

I think now you can choose the best answer to the MCQ, I raised at the beginning.
