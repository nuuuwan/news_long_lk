# EU approves first subsidies for hydrogen projects

## Summary ü§ñ

The European Commission has allocated subsidies for renewable hydrogen production projects for the first time, awarding a total of ‚Ç¨720m in its first auction, primarily to Spain and Portugal. Two projects in Norway and Finland received the remaining ‚Ç¨126m. The subsidies will likely result in the production of 1.58 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year, still only a small fraction of the European Union‚Äôs (EU) target of producing 10 million tonnes per year by 2030. The EU‚Äôs new Hydrogen Bank programme, which is aimed at bridging the current gap in costs until hydrogen becomes economically viable, is funding the approved subsidies.


## Follow-up Questions ü§ñ

1. How will these subsidies affect the renewable hydrogen production in Spain and Portugal?
2. How are the specific projects that will be receiving subsidies going to impact the overall production of green hydrogen in the EU?
3. Can you elaborate more on the EU‚Äôs new Hydrogen Bank program? What is its main objective and how does it plan to achieve it?
4. Why do you think there was a high demand for these subsidies yet the level of subsidies requested by the successful bids was low?
5. How does the EU plan to address the possible systematic underbidding by companies?
6. What are the consequences for projects which fail to start production by late 2029?
7. What does the European Commission intend to learn from this pilot auction?
8. How will the EU's Emissions Trading System finance these subsidies?
9. Why were no German projects successful in receiving subsidies from the auction? 
10. Can you provide more details about the upcoming auction round due to take place later this year? 
11. How does this subsidy allocation contribute towards the EU's goal of drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030? 
12. What are the projected costs of large-scale hydrogen production in the EU?
13. How does the production of green hydrogen differ in Iberian and Nordic countries? Why were these regions specifically chosen for the subsidies? 
14. What impact will falling hydrogen production costs have on the overall renewable energy industry in Europe? 
15. What specific lessons has the Commission learned from this first auction, and how will they use this knowledge to improve the selection process in the future?

EU approves first subsidies for hydrogen projects

EnergyEuropeCountry AnalysisEnergy

The European Commission has announced the results of its first auction to allocate subsidies for renewable hydrogen production projects, awarding a total of ‚Ç¨720m, of which more than ‚Ç¨590m went to projects in Spain and Portugal. Two projects in Norway and Finland received the remaining ‚Ç¨126m. The subsidies awarded are projected to result in the production of 1.58m tonnes of green hydrogen a year, representing only 1.5% of the EU‚Äôs target of producing 10m tonnes annually by 2030.¬†Large-scale hydrogen production will remain a challenge for Europe and will need financial support from the EU to succeed in meeting its ambitious targets.

The EU has committed to drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing green hydrogen production to 10m tonnes per year by 2030. The approved subsidies come from the EU‚Äôs new Hydrogen Bank programme, which is aimed at establishing a hydrogen economy by bridging the current gap in costs until hydrogen becomes economically viable as a competitive industry. Green hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water with no emission of greenhouse gases.

The selection of the Iberian and Nordic countries for subsidies reflects the large share of their power production that comes from renewable resources. The Commission wants production to be based in countries with significant renewable energy sources that can also offer competitive costs for the electricity used in producing the gas.

Although demand for the subsidies was high‚Äîmore than 132¬†projects applied for a total of more than ‚Ç¨12bn in support‚Äîthe level of subsidies requested by the successful bids was low. A project to use hydrogen to produce renewable methane in Finland asked for a subsidy of only 37¬†euro cents per kg of hydrogen, while the Iberian and Norwegian projects requested 48¬†cents per kg. This was about ten times lower than the cap of ‚Ç¨4.5 per kg placed on bids and much lower than had been expected. A total of 21 German projects applied for subsidies in the auction, but none proved successful.

The low bids suggest possible systematic underbidding by companies to make their projects appear more cost-competitive, as well as an expectation of falling hydrogen production costs, which are forecast to drop as the technology improves and producers scale up. Firms may also be keen to establish an early presence in the nascent hydrogen industry at lower initial subsidies than would be required to cover the ‚Äúgreen premium‚Äù gap with regular markets.

The subsidies will be financed by the sale of carbon dioxide (CO2) allowances through the EU‚Äôs Emissions Trading System. The projects receiving support must start production by late 2029 or they will be deemed liable for breaking their contracts.

The EU‚Äôs first hydrogen subsidy auction highlights both the high demand for financial support and the cost challenges still facing large-scale hydrogen production if Europe is to meet its renewable energy goals.¬†After this pilot auction, from which the Commission hopes to ‚Äúdraw on the lessons learned‚Äù, another auction round is due to take place later this year.
