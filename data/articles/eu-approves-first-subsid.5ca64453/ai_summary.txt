The European Commission has allocated subsidies for renewable hydrogen production projects for the first time, awarding a total of €720m in its first auction, primarily to Spain and Portugal. Two projects in Norway and Finland received the remaining €126m. The subsidies will likely result in the production of 1.58 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year, still only a small fraction of the European Union’s (EU) target of producing 10 million tonnes per year by 2030. The EU’s new Hydrogen Bank programme, which is aimed at bridging the current gap in costs until hydrogen becomes economically viable, is funding the approved subsidies.
