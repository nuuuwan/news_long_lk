Many organizations are cautious about adopting generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications due to concerns such as privacy and security threats, potential bias, copyright infringement and discrimination. The risks of AI can be categorized into intent and usage. Accidental misuse and deliberate malpractice of AI represent different intentions, while the use of generative AI tools to create content is a different usage from consuming content made with such tools. To reduce these risks, organizations need to detect, identify, and prevent misleading content. A Gartner poll of 2,500 executives found that approximately 70% are considering how to integrate generative AI into their organizations. Furthermore, the AI adoption rates have been reported to increase across all surveyed regions, according to the Stanford AI Index Report.
