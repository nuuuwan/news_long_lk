    "Entrepreneurs are uniquely positioned to provide innovative solutions to urgent challenges that require concentrated, collaborative effort. But to scale these solutions, founders need more than just capital \u2014 they need strong, effective support from their investors. As a result, in recent years, it\u2019s become increasingly common for VCs to claim that they view startup founders as their customers. But what does it take for investors to move beyond platitudes and actually serve the entrepreneurs they fund as effectively as traditional companies serve their customers? Decades of research have shown that NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is a powerful methodology for soliciting and acting on customer feedback in traditional business environments. To truly serve entrepreneurs as customers, VCs should adopt the NPS methodology for their own organizations by following four steps: 1) Solicit feedback, 2) analyze the responses you get, 3) prioritize and implement improvement areas, and 4) communicate the changes back.",
    "Every business is defined by its customers \u2014 but it\u2019s not always obvious who an organization\u2019s customers really are. When it comes to VC firms, investors have historically and unsurprisingly viewed their limited partners (LPs) \u2014\u00a0the source of VCs\u2019 funding \u2014 as their customers.",
