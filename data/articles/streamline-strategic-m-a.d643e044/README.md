In the rapidly evolving Medtech industry, staying on top of growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–related deal activity, is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity.

For one leading MedTech company, Avanos Medical, the challenge was clear: streamline its corporate development and strategy workflows to drive innovation and maintain a competitive edge. The obstacle? A fragmented approach to market intelligence that slowed down decision making and obscured valuable insights.

Avanos’s strategy team needed comprehensive, timely market data, including insights on private markets, and to swiftly navigate vast amounts of information across news, research, filings, and transcripts. With the quick pace of change in industries, news, and technology, dealmakers need to consume far more data, analyze it faster, and make precise decisions on strategy and M&A.

Navigating Complex Data

The MedTech company struggled with disparate data sources that were time-consuming to consolidate. This fragmentation of data sources led to delays in market analysis and made it difficult to identify viable investment opportunities and partnerships, particularly in the private markets. This often resulted in missed opportunities and deferred or delayed strategic decisions.

“It’s always a challenge to find information on companies in a niche or emerging market,” says David Mornhinweg, Director of Corporate Development, Avanos Medical, “and even more challenging to find accurate and current information on potential acquisition targets, including management teams, size, and growth.”

Insight at Every Data Point

To address these challenges, Avanos implemented a robust solution offering in-depth market commentary and comprehensive data coverage. Avanos selected a product from a company that continually invests in its development, ensuring users can quickly and easily access relevant insights.

Avanos also gained workflow benefits. The Corporate Development & Strategy team transformed the company’s workflows with three key improvements:

1. New and granular insights on private markets: Access to extensive private markets data enabled the company to discover and evaluate potential investment opportunities and partnerships that were previously under the radar. This new capability allowed Avanos to expand its reach and use emerging technologies and startups in the MedTech space.

2. Collaboration tools: The solution’s AI-powered Document Viewer tool streamlined the process of data analysis by allowing the team to view and annotate multiple documents within the platform and discover insights faster. The team also began using an advanced charting and forecasting tool, a robust Excel plug-in tool, and a library of 550+ templates, helping it facilitate quicker review cycles and improve collaboration to enhance its strategic decision making.

3.  In-depth aftermarket research: With advanced tools for investment and aftermarket research, Avanos gained insights into market trends, competitor activities, and potential risks. This comprehensive data supported more accurate forecasting and investment strategies better aligned with long-term business objectives.

A Strategic Leap Forward

It’s hard to find a solution with high-quality information on an easy-to-use platform, but Avanos now had one.

“The new Market Maps for our target markets in health care allowed us to quickly identify major players, and the visuals made it easy to see deal trends across M&A and private capital funding,” Mornhinweg says.

“I saved a ton of time using Document Viewer,” he says. “For example, when I open a transcript, I now have a high-level summary before digging into the text. I can also see all the companies mentioned, so I get a sense of important relationships, partnerships, areas of growth, and areas of risk.”

The integration of this solution, S&P Capital IQ Pro, revolutionized Avanos’s market analysis and investment strategy workflows. The integration of private markets, Document Viewer, and investment/aftermarket research features into their workflows led to:

• A significant reduction in time spent on data gathering and analysis, allowing the strategy team to focus on higher-value activities.

• Improved accuracy of market forecasts and strategic decisions, leading to more successful investments and partnerships.

• Enhanced collaboration and information sharing among team members, fostering a culture of informed decision making and proactive strategy formulation.

Avanos Medical’s integration of an industry-leading market intelligence platform has transformed its corporate development and strategy workflows, enabling the team to navigate complex data landscapes. By streamlining market analysis and enhancing collaboration, Avanos can now make better, faster, more informed, and more strategic decisions to drive innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the MedTech sector. This strategic leap forward positions Avanos for sustained growth and competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market.

Many other sectors can also benefit from similar technologies to enhance their data-driven decision-making processes. As industries increasingly rely on timely insights to navigate competitive landscapes, the adoption of advanced analytics solutions will be crucial for maintaining a strategic edge.
