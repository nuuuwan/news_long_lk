That organizational change can overwhelm employees to the point of being harmful is hardly a new concept. We’ve known for years that poorly managed, unintegrated change can not only lead to reduced performance, but risks the well-being of employees as well. For example, one study of 632 public sector employees found that “concerns about change, measured during the anticipation stage of an organizational change process, relate to higher burnout and lower work engagement.”

Many people in the workplace today are reporting substantial change fatigue thanks to constantly shifting workplace flex policies, the arrival of technologies like AI, capricious layoffs, working across multiple generations with different values, and generally, a cognitive load consumed with angst about what all this change will mean for them. I’ve long said that the belief that humans fear change is a myth. What humans actually fear is change that excludes them. And it would seem this recent wave of relentless change validates that: 49% of workers feel that they will be left behind from the pace of change. (I recently wrote about employees’ fears of becoming obsolete, and what they can do to navigate perceived threats to their ambitions.)

All this intensified fatigue won’t bode well for legitimate organizational efforts to improve cultures, build new capabilities and products, and strengthen market performance. Research from Gartner revealed that the post-pandemic increase of sizable change initiatives led to a sharp drop in employees’ willingness to support enterprise change efforts — from 75% in 2016 to just 43% in 2022.

Too often, the seeds of failure are sewn into a defensive conception of change, long before any activity gets underway. But it doesn’t have to be that way. We don’t have to drain our organizations into exhaustion with unrelenting change that never realizes its promise. If you’re responsible for leading a team through substantial transformation and are seeing signs of fatigue, here are some ways you can ensure you aren’t the one causing it.

Investigate your motivation for the change

New research from Declan Fitzsimons, Jennifer Louise Petriglieri, and Gianpiero Petriglieri at INSEAD shows that many large-scale change initiatives are born not of strategic relevance or competitive importance but rather from a leader’s need to stave off their own anxiety about performance challenges. They refer to this as “defensive organizing.”

I spoke with study coauthor Gianpiero Petriglieri, who told me that defensive organizing makes its appearance in four phases. First, the leader has concern over some persistent performance challenge that hasn’t abated. Then, the leader gathers people together to discuss the problem and identify possible remedies. Petriglieri says:

People grasp onto an idea like a life raft in the storm. That idea could be forming a task force, adopting new technology, or some other very attractive notion. As soon as that idea gets brought in, everyone thinks, “This is amazing! It’s absolutely going to work.” This uncritical embrace of an idea generates a sudden shift from concern to enthusiasm, making everyone feel joined together against the problem that’s “out there” somewhere.

Over time, the idea becomes more widely adopted, and more people get involved in order to build buy-in. But as the idea fails to improve the performance challenge, intensified efforts devolve into the third phase of defensive organizing — exhaustion that overrides the burst of initial enthusiasm — and eventually settles into the final phase: widespread resentment for the wasted energy and resources. “The whole time, the initiative’s real purpose is to diffuse and displace leadership’s anxiety over the performance challenge they can’t resolve,” reflects Petriglieri. “And as things slow down, they once again feel the worry, and then have to ramp up the machine again and do more, causing more exhaustion, keeping the vicious cycle in motion.”

If you’re sponsoring change to address some stubborn performance challenge and suddenly find yourself in a groundswell of enthusiasm for an idea that feels like a silver bullet, don’t get excited and relieved — get suspicious and pause the process. Acknowledge that your motivation for fueling such enthusiasm may well be to disperse your anxiety among more people, thus avoiding, not resolving, the real performance challenge.

Confront your denial and limitations

“You can’t change the world if you’re not willing to change your world,” says Petriglieri. “We work in a world where organizations believe leaders have more capacity to predict and affect performance than they do. Leaders don’t want to look in the mirror and face the limits of their control.”

The flurry of intensified activity surrounding change initiatives serves as a numbing agent to keep leaders from feeling the pains of real trouble. I’ve seen organizations whip up innovation crazes, investing tens of millions of dollars into R&D pipelines to confront hemorrhaging market share, ignoring the reality that their core products are rapidly commoditizing or becoming irrelevant and consumers aren’t interested in new-fangled versions of obsolete products. But when the CMO shows up with market analytics that suggest that “improvements” to the core offerings could revitalize sales and grow margins, the company is all in.

For leaders, the pain of acknowledging the end of their monopolistic market share, their refusal to recognize the causes of declining sales, and the inability to admit that the kind of transformation required for them to succeed long term would take more years than shareholders would tolerate, are all too overwhelming to consider. This kind of self-deception, however, conspires to lure the organization into the vicious cycle of defensive organizing.

Before launching into some breakthrough idea, reflect long and hard about what internal or external challenges you may be avoiding. And further, look deep within yourself to be sure you aren’t averting a self-honest acknowledgement of your own limitations.

Surface people’s honest feelings about the change, including your own

After more than three decades of consulting for organizations on strategic change, I’ve seen my fair share of ill-conceived change efforts. And in my experience, there are always people at the periphery of the efforts, and sometimes directly at the center of them, privately harboring pessimism about the odds of success. Many of them talk privately about the absurdity of the efforts despite publicly showing eager support.

Recently I saw this at one organization I was advising as they wrestled with their evolving return-to-office policies. The CEO had mandated what felt like arbitrary rules about when and how often people needed to work in the office. The CHRO had deep concerns about how employees’ negative reactions would diminish their ability to retain key talent. When I asked if she’d offered the CEO alternatives, she said, “You know how he is once he’s made up his mind.” She said many on the team shared her concerns. Yet in the room, I watched them all affirmatively and politely nod in support of the change.

Says Petriglieri, “When questionable change is unfolding, ask yourself if you are being invited into the change, or if you are being coopted into the change. Because if you feel like you’re being coopted, you already know it’s not going to work.”

If your private feelings about your change efforts contradict what you’re saying publicly, acknowledge that your greatest deception is to yourself, not those you’re affirming the change to or colluding with about its pitfalls. Worse, in your betrayal of your own voice, you set the example for others to join you in feeling one thing, but saying another. Without the ability to be honest, your organization is inculcating the greatest form of change fatigue: the cognitive dissonance created by having to hide their true feelings while feigning positive regard for change. It’s exhausting and ultimately gives way to the final phase of defensive organization: resentment.

At the outset of any major change, I have my clients set stringent ground rules about how they will be completely candid with one another, define what criteria they will use to objectively measure progress, and how they will gather wide swathes of opinions about risks from those lower in the organization. Inserting safeguards against groupthink, collusion, and self-deception into the change process can help reduce the threat of months (even years) of wasted effort and resources.

Name what you can’t control

Much of the anxiety fueling defensive organizing comes from the many factors outside the control of leaders trying to stave off disaster or capitalize on market opportunities. The crescendo of enthusiasm for new ideas is largely born from the illusion that if leaders join forces, they can conquer the challenge or opportunity — regardless of precedence, the high degree of uncertainty, and uncontrollable dynamics.

One of the greatest culprits in the failure of strategic change is the untested assumptions that are never surfaced and interrogated. At the start of large-scale strategic change, I have my clients write down all the assumptions they’re making about the prospects of success, failure, each other’s capabilities, the organization’s capacity to execute, and the future outcomes they want from the investments. The common theme among the lists of assumptions is inevitably a gross overestimation of how much control they have over totally uncontrollable factors. Naming the truth of their collective limitations frees leaders to focus on what they can and should control. Says Petriglieri:

When we expect leaders to be knowledgeable and capable in precisely the moments in which everyone else is uncertain and paralyzed, we make it difficult for them to ask for help. The moments when leaders ought to be acknowledging, “I don’t know what’s happening out there” or “I’m not sure what to do; do you know?” are the moments we make them face the existential doubts: “If I don’t have the answer, I must not be competent. How then will I prove I deserve this role? Am I really who I’ve convinced others that I am?”

Accept that the chance to introduce change to your team, department, or enterprise is a privilege. You are leaving an indelible mark on customers, shareholders, and the careers of those you lead. Take that privilege seriously. Don’t let delusions of grandeur or a desperate need to quell anxiety blind you to what you can’t control or your own limitations. Instead, begin the journey of change with a posture of “I don’t know” versus “I already know.” Set the example of admitting your angst about the unknown and what you hope you and your team can learn together, making it safe for them to grow and challenge you along the way. Organize change that way, and you’ll infuse those you lead with energy, not fatigue.
