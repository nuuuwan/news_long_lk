    "To the best of my knowledge, I am not a robot. And yet, like other humans who spend too much time on the internet, I\u2019m routinely asked to prove this fact by clicking on crosswalks and motorcycles in photos, deciphering distorted numbers and letters, and checking little white boxes that affirm my non-robot status. These so-called captchas, or \u201ccompletely automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart,\u201d are supposed to help prevent spam and data scraping, although it now appears that bots are better at solving them than humans. Go figure.\u00a0 Thankfully, the difference between humans and machines in the real world is much easier to discern, at least for now. One of the more robust differentiators involves our unique skill sets. While machines tend to excel at things adults find difficult\u2014playing world-champion-level chess, say, or multiplying really big numbers\u2014they find it difficult (or impossible) to accomplish the stuff a five-year-old can do with ease, such as catching a ball or walking around a room without bumping into things.\u00a0 Related StoryWill we ever trust robots?If most robots still need remote human operators to be safe and effective, why should we welcome them into our homes?",
    "This discrepancy between the relative ease of teaching a machine abstract thinking and the difficulty of teaching it basic sensory, social, and motor skills is what\u2019s known as Moravec\u2019s paradox. Named after an observation the roboticist Hans Moravec made back in the late 1980s, the paradox states that what\u2019s hard for humans (math, logic, scientific reasoning) is easy for machines, and what\u2019s hard for machines (tying shoelaces, reading emotions, having a conversation) is easy for humans.\u00a0 In her latest book, Robots and the People Who Love Them: Holding On to Our Humanity in an Age of Social Robots, science writer Eve Herold argues that thanks to new approaches in machine learning and continued advances in AI, we\u2019re finally starting to unravel this paradox. As a result, a new era of personal and social robots is about to unfold, she says\u2014one that will force us to reimagine the nature of everything from friendship and love to work, health care, and home life.",
    "Robots and the People Who Love Them: Holding On to Our Humanity in an Age of Social RobotsEve HeroldST. MARTIN\u2019S PRESS, 2024   To give readers a sense of what this brave new world of social robots will look like, Herold points us toward Pepper, a doe-eyed humanoid robot that\u2019s made by the Japanese company SoftBank. \u201cRobots like Pepper will soon make themselves indispensable because of their unique, highly personalized relationships with us,\u201d Herold writes, before describing with press-release-like zeal how this chest-high companion can effortlessly read our expressions and emotional states and respond appropriately in its own childlike voice.  If Pepper sounds vaguely familiar, it may be because it was relentlessly hyped as the world\u2019s first \u201cemotional robot\u201d in the years following its 2014 introduction. That abruptly stopped in 2021, however, when SoftBank pulled the plug on Pepper production because of lack of demand and\u2014probably not unrelatedly\u2014the $2,000 android\u2019s general incompetence. Books can obviously take a long time to write, and a lot can change while you\u2019re writing them. But it\u2019s hard to reconcile this particular oversight with the fact that Pepper was canned some three years before the book\u2019s publication.",
    "Positioning a defunct product that nobody seems to have liked or bought as part of some vanguard for a new social-\u00adrobot revolution doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Herold might respond by pointing out that her book\u2019s focus is less on the robots themselves than on what we humans will bring to the new social relationships we forge with them. Fair enough.\u00a0 But while she dutifully unpacks our penchant for anthropomorphizing and walks readers through some rudimentary research on deep learning and the uncanny valley, Herold\u2019s conclusions about human nature and psychology often seem either oversimplified or divorced from the evidence she provides. For someone who says that \u201cthe only way to write about the future is with a high degree of humility,\u201d there are also an unusually large number of deeply questionable assertions (\u201cSo far, the trust we\u2019ve placed in algorithms has been, on balance, well placed \u2026\u201d) and sweeping predictions (\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt some version of a companion robot will be coming soon to homes throughout the industrialized world\u201d). \u00a0\u00a0 Early on in the book, Herold reminds readers that \u201cscience writing that attempts to envision the future often says much more about the time it was written than it says about the future world.\u201d In this respect, Robots and the People Who Love Them is indeed quite revealing. Among other things, the book reflects the way we tend to reduce discussions of technological impacts into binary terms (\u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing\u201d/\u201dIt\u2019ll be terrible\u201d); the shrugging acquiescence with which we seem to regard undesirable outcomes; the readiness of science and technology writers to succumb to industry hype; and the disturbing extent to which the logic and values of machines (speed, efficiency) have already been adopted by humans. It\u2019s probably not one of Herold\u2019s intended takeaways, but if the book demonstrates anything, it\u2019s not that robots are becoming more like us; it\u2019s that we\u2019re becoming more like them.\u00a0  Vox ex Machina: A Cultural History of Talking MachinesSarah A. BellMIT PRESS, 2024   For a more rigorous look at one of the pillars of human social expression\u2014and, specifically, how we\u2019ve tried to transfer it to machines\u2014Sarah A. Bell\u2019s Vox ex Machina: A Cultural History of Talking Machines offers a compelling and insightful history of voice synthesis during the 20th century. Bell, a writer and professor at Michigan Technological University, is interested in how we try to digitally reproduce different expressions of human embodiment, be it speech, emotions, or visual identities. As she points out early on in the book, understanding this process often means understanding the ways in which engineers (almost universally male ones) have decided to measure and quantify aspects of our bodies.  The story begins at the epicenter for many of the century\u2019s most important technological breakthroughs: Bell Labs. By the 1930s, researchers there were already thinking about human speech as a type of signal or, as the head of the acoustics research department put it years later, \u201cspecialized acoustic code.\u201d One of those engineers, Homer Dudley, likened the tongue to a telegraph tapper, seeing it as merely an instrument inside our mouths that \u201cmodulated the \u2018carrier wave\u2019 emanating from the glottis.\u201d In the same way that Morse code broke down writing into parts for later reassembly, Dudley believed, speech sounds\u2014and everything else that makes up the richness of human vocal expression\u2014could similarly be compressed, or reduced to pulses. According to Bell, researchers like Dudley laid the groundwork for pretty much all the voice synthesis work that has come since, \u201cembedding their assumptions about the mechanical nature of the human voice in all the technologies that would follow.\u201d One of the first and most famous examples of Dudley\u2019s work was the Voder, or Voice Demonstrator. Debuting at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair in New York, it was basically a small voice organ that was operated by \u201cVoderettes,\u201d women who went through a year of training to master all the speech sounds the machine could make by manipulating 10 keys, a wrist plate, and a pedal.\u00a0  Debuting at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair in New York, the Voder was a small voice organ operated by \u201cVoderettes,\u201d women trained to master the machine\u2019s speech soundsCOLLECTIONS OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY   The talking-machine demonstrations, although highly choreographed, were a hit with visitors and the press\u2014so much so that people seemed willing to attribute far more understanding and autonomy to the Voder than was warranted. Even though the Voderette was in full view during the entire demonstration, the press usually mentioned the woman responsible for making the sounds only in passing, if at all. Instead, the Voder was anthropomorphized and granted a high degree of agency. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t any mouth, lungs, or larynx\u2014but he talks a blue streak,\u201d wrote Popular Science.\u00a0 Related StoryHow cuddly robots could change dementia careResearchers are using AI and technological advancements to create companion robots",
    "From the Voder and Elektro the Moto-Man to Speak & Spell and Perfect Paul to Alexa and Siri, Vox ex Machina showcases both the products of voice synthesis and the underlying technologies that made them possible. It\u2019s a fascinating tour, particularly when Bell focuses on the ways in which the public\u2019s reaction to these \u201ctalking machines\u201d presaged its reaction to the \u201cthinking\u201d ones that would emerge decades later. While the practice of describing humans with machine metaphors and machines with human metaphors dates back centuries, the ability of machines to simulate human speech (however poorly) \u201cgave machinic personification a new inflection,\u201d writes Bell.",
    "In other words, the more machines could \u201cspeak\u201d and \u201cthink,\u201d the more we started to think of ourselves as machines. Indeed, one can\u2019t help but see striking parallels to what\u2019s happening with today\u2019s artificial intelligence\u2014specifically, our willingness to reduce or minimize what makes us human to better conform to whatever \u201cintelligent\u201d attribute a product may be demonstrating. Sam Altman\u2019s response to the fact that LLMs are just really good word calculators? \u201ci am a stochastic parrot, and so r u.\u201d  \u201cForget about losing jobs to automation. Remarkably, the reality is that humans steal the jobs of robots.\u201d  The Voder may have been one of the first crude attempts at speech synthesis, but the disconnect between the way it worked (with a lot of human training and labor) and the way the public and press perceived it (as a more or less autonomous machine with its own voice) foreshadowed a problem we still face today. In Waiting for Robots: The Hired Hands of Automation, Antonio A. Casilli argues that despite claims to the contrary, human input remains a crucial component of all modern automation and artificial-intelligence tools, regardless of their sophistication. The difference is that instead of this role being obvious\u2014as was the case with the Voderettes\u2014it\u2019s now hidden, and usually on purpose.  Waiting for Robots: The Hired Hands of AutomationAntonio A. CasilliUNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2024   Casilli is a sociology professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Paris who studies the unseen and unacknowledged \u201cdigital labor\u201d that undergirds many of today\u2019s social media platforms, microtask sites, and on-demand services. Rather than viewing automation and AI as destroyers of human jobs, he makes a convincing case that they merely result in the further atomization of work, fracturing it into smaller, more meaningless, more demeaning tasks for many of us. \u201cForget about losing jobs to automation,\u201d he writes. \u201cRemarkably, the reality is that humans steal the jobs of robots.\u201d Whether it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, a service for recruiting hundreds of thousands of micro-taskers to perform video-filtering and image-tagging tasks that machines can\u2019t do, or the perpetual human \u201csupervision\u201d and \u201creinforcement\u201d required for automated learning and AI training, Casilli gives readers plenty of examples of how human labor (much of it coming from Asian, Latin American, and African countries) props up\u2014or, in some cases, pretends to actually be\u2014intelligent systems and products.

    "Ultimately, Casilli is less concerned that robots will replace white-collar workers, and more worried that thousands of lower-paid or unpaid digital workers will. As he points out, we are already unwittingly being recruited by companies to collectively perform millions of hours of free work every year. Take the aforementioned captchas: Google, which owns and deploys one of the most popular versions of the service (ReCAPTCHA and No CAPTCHA), has been using this digital labor for more than a decade. The results help detect house numbers to improve Google Street View, digitize texts for Google Books, and train its computer vision algorithms to detect locations and reconstruct scenes, enhancing Google Images and improving the performance of Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars. \u201cThe irony here is that a service that is supposed to distinguish humans from robots is actually making humans work to produce more robots,\u201d Casilli writes. While all the hype and hyperbole surrounding today\u2019s AI tools can feel unprecedented, Casilli reminds readers that such rhetoric isn\u2019t really new at all. Robots, automation, and various intelligent systems have been just on the verge of taking over all aspects of our work lives and cultural output for decades now. In the end, artificial intelligence is a technological process that isn\u2019t actually artificial, he says. Peer behind the curtains of smooth and seamless efficiency, and it\u2019s humans all the way down. Bryan Gardiner is a writer based in Oakland, California. hide"
