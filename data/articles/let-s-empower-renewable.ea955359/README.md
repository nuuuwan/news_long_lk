Ultimately, we will all benefit—financially, environmentally, and nationally—because we are the ones who will either bear the costs or reap the rewards of our energy decisions

As a patriotic layperson, I feel compelled to bring to the attention of the nation and our policymakers a critical discussion hosted online by a panel of highly distinguished academics and experts in the field of renewable energy. This initiative was voluntary, unbiased, and carried out solely for the benefit of the country.

Sri Lanka is blessed with an abundance of natural resources—hydro, solar, wind, biomass, and more. Most importantly, we have the potential to harness these resources to produce green hydrogen, enabling our nation to transition from a fossil fuel importer to a clean energy exporter.

Energy is fundamental to modern life, powering everything from cooking and lighting to transportation and communication. Producing electricity at the lowest possible cost is not merely a technical goal but a national imperative. Lower energy costs directly reduce the cost of living and make Sri Lanka more attractive for investment. Combined with our skilled and educated workforce, this gives us a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable economic development.

As citizens, we have a responsibility to stay informed and support initiatives like this. We must be willing to understand and embrace the complex—but—essential system upgrades needed for this transformation. Ultimately, we will all benefit—financially, environmentally, and nationally—because we are the ones who will either bear the costs or reap the rewards of our energy decisions.

Every effort counts. Do your part, however small, to support swift and decisive Government action towards advancing renewable energy in Sri Lanka.

That said, we face significant challenges. Our current power infrastructure urgently needs upgrading to maintain a synchronised 50Hz supply. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) must work collaboratively with policymakers to fast-track this transition. We cannot afford to slide deeper into fossil fuel dependency. In this context, the leadership of the CEB, the Government, and all stakeholders must unite to develop and commit to a clear, long-term energy strategy—one that is resilient, apolitical, and grounded in the national interest.

Let us stand together to empower renewable energy in Sri Lanka. With our natural resources and technical capabilities, we can—and must—become a nation that exports clean energy rather than imports dirty fuels.

We encourage you to watch this insightful presentation by world-renowned professionals and thought leaders in the field: YouTube Link: https://youtu.be/pR7b4GhWfag.

Please share it widely—with policymakers, peers, and others in your network. Let your voice be heard—through advocacy, dialogue, or action—for the sake of our country’s energy security and sustainable future.
