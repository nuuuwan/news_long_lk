  "body_paragraphs": [
    "The Central Bank\u2019s latest report reveals that Rs. 1.16 trillion in vehicle-backed loans were issued in just the first six months of 2025\u2014an astonishing 63% of total lending by Licensed Finance Companies. On the surface, this looks like a sign of recovery. Pent-up demand has finally been released after years of import restrictions. Government revenue has improved, and auto sector activity has revived.",
    "But beneath this celebratory headline lies a troubling question:",
    "Are we once again fuelling consumption with debt, instead of funding growth?",
    "In the past, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange crisis was triggered partly by excessive reliance on imported, non-productive consumption goods\u2014vehicles being the most notable example. Now, scarce credit and foreign reserves are again being",
    "funnelled into the same pattern.",
    "From a national economic standpoint, the risks are clear:",
    "nHigher foreign currency leakage \u2014 over $ 1.5 billion payments expected for vehicle imports this year",
    "nWorsening trade deficit \u2014 more pressure on already fragile external stability",
    "nReduced credit to productive sectors \u2014 exports, SMEs, local manufacturing pushed aside",
    "nInflation and fuel demand spike \u2014 as more imported vehicles hit congested roads",
    "nRising household debt burden \u2014 future consumption and financial resilience weakened",
    "And what about the borrowers who are being tempted by easy leasing and promotional offers?",
    "A vehicle is not an appreciating asset\u2014it loses value every day, even from the time it is rolled out of a showroom. When loan instalments stretch beyond incomes, many families risk ending up with a depreciated vehicle and a very real debt. If a future depreciation of the rupee or interest rate hike occurs, that risk becomes even more severe.",
    "So yes\u2014government coffers are smiling today. But is this truly fiscal achievement if it is built on taxing imported cars, instead of growing our economy?",
    "Sri Lanka cannot afford another cycle where debt-driven consumption is mistaken for development. If two-thirds of lending is going into vehicles rather than value-adding to productive enterprises, we are postponing progress\u2014not advancing it.",
    "It is time policymakers asked themselves a simple question:",
    "Are we financing mobility\u2014or mortgaging the future?",
    "A Worried Mind - Moratuwa"
