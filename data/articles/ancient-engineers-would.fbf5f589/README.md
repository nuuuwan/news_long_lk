We were once a kingdom of cascading reservoirs and radiant minds. Let us now become a republic of clean energy and shared prosperity

Centuries before the world debated net-zero targets or climate resilience, Sri Lanka was living the principles of sustainability. Not in theory, but in soil, stone, and water.

From the 3rd century BC to the 13th century AD, this island known to be the pearl of the Indian Ocean was a beacon of engineering brilliance and agricultural wisdom. Monarchs like King Vasabha, Mahasen, and the great Parakramabahu envisioned and built a hydraulic civilisation so intricate and efficient that it astonished modern engineers and environmentalists alike. The crown jewel of this ancient brilliance? A vast, interconnected web of over 30,000 tanks and canals that collected, conserved, and shared water.

Take the Yodha Ela canal: built in the 5th century, it carried water 87 kilometres from Kala Wewa to Tissa Wewa in Anuradhapura with a gradient of just one inch per 1,000 feet. UNESCO called it “an engineering marvel centuries ahead of its time.” This wasn’t just infrastructure; it was national identity. It was how a small island fed millions, even in drought.

But somewhere along the way, we forgot.

Grand promises, missed potential: The lessons of Mahinda Chinthana

In 2005, the Mahinda Chinthana vision swept in with a surge of nationalist pride and large-scale ambition. It promised to transform Sri Lanka into the “Miracle of Asia” with highways, ports, and airports. And yes, it built big. But it also borrowed big.

Projects like the Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport were conceived with geopolitical urgency but delivered questionable utility. By 2017, Mattala had earned the title of “world’s emptiest airport” (Forbes, 2016), while Hambantota—struggling under debt—was leased to China for 99 years to settle dues (New York Times, 2018).

The energy sector fared no better. Coal and diesel were prioritised over renewables. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for thermal plants were signed with minimal transparency. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) became a loss-making giant, bleeding over Rs. 100 billion annually by 2021 (PUCSL Annual Report 2022).

In a nation bathed in sun, solar remained a footnote.

A new dawn: Sri Lanka’s solar pivot

Fast forward to 2024. The economic collapse of 2022 shook Sri Lanka to its core unlike ever before. Blackouts, fuel lines, and food shortages revealed the fragility of our centralised, fossil-fuel dependent system. But crisis, as history shows, breeds clarity.

Enter the Electricity Act of 2024, a quietly revolutionary piece of legislation passed with rare bipartisan support. It:

Unbundles the CEB into generation, transmission, and distribution entities.

Introduces an independent energy regulator.

Opens the sector to private and foreign investment (Reuters, June 2024).

The national target? 70% renewable energy by 2030, with solar expected to generate over 40% of national supply (Sri Lanka Energy Sector Master Plan, 2023-2040).

Already, the gears are turning:

India’s NTPC Ltd. is investing $ 442 million in a 135 MW solar park in Sampur.

Time-of-use tariffs are being piloted to encourage solar-plus-storage systems.

Sri Lanka now chairs the International Solar Alliance’s Asia-Pacific arm, gaining global credibility (ISA Secretariat, 2025).

The direction is clear: from dependency to dignity.

Why global investors should pay attention

Sri Lanka isn’t just reforming. It’s repositioning. Here’s why it deserves a closer look:

Market size and returns

Sri Lanka needs $ 12–15 billion in renewable energy investments by 2030 (ADB Country Energy Outlook, 2023).

Average solar irradiance is 5.97 kWh/m²/day, among the best in Asia (World Bank Solar Atlas).

Green energy projects qualify for 10-year tax holidays and duty exemptions under the BOI (BOI Green Energy Brief, 2024).

Legal and regulatory safeguards

The Electricity Act 2024 guarantees PPA transparency, access to arbitration, and regulatory independence.

The Central Bank and IFC are developing green bond frameworks for climate-linked capital markets (UNDP Green Finance Roadmap, 2023).

Positioned between India and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka is a regional solar corridor.

Recent trilateral energy pacts with India and UAE aim to turn Trincomalee into a clean energy export hub (Reuters, April 2025).

Sri Lanka isn’t asking for sympathy. It’s offering unparalleled market potential.

For policymakers: Turning reform into results

If we want the world to invest, we must de-risk our vision. Here are the next steps:

End ad-hoc pricing changes. Introduce long-term, cost-reflective feed-in tariffs for solar + storage.

Pass enabling regulations for dual-use solar farming.

Integrate solar with irrigation, drying, and post-harvest storage.

Finance local champions

Launch $ 500 m diaspora green bond program.

Offer concessional loans for local SMEs in solar value chains.

Train 50,000+ youth in solar installation, system design, and energy entrepreneurship (Ministry of Skills Development, 2025 Draft).

We owe our people not just power, but purpose.

The agrivoltaic revolution: Where past meets the future

One of the most exciting models emerging is the AgriVoltaic Project in Eastern Province proposed by the UK based

Noteworthy Global Pvt Ltd.:

100 MW solar farm integrated with 3,000+ red chilli farmers.

Free seed distribution, drip irrigation, and a buy-back scheme to stabilise income.

Solar dryers and bee-barrier fencing to reduce post-harvest loss and elephant conflict.

This isn’t innovation for its own sake. It’s a return to what Sri Lanka once was: a civilisation where water, sunlight, and community worked as one.

Closing: This time, let the light last

We were once a kingdom of cascading reservoirs and radiant minds. Let us now become a republic of clean energy and shared prosperity.

The same sun that rose over Mihintale and Polonnaruwa now shines on our rooftops, our fields, our ambitions. This isn’t just about electricity. It’s about rebuilding a nation’s soul.

From tanks to solar fields, Sri Lanka can reclaim its legacy. And this time, let the light last.
