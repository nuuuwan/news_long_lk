The International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme for Sri Lanka benefits primarily the fund itself, the Sri Lankan government and external creditors who are being repaid, while people in the country suffer under the rising cost of living, according to an opinion piece. The author argues that IMF funds don't provide a bailout, but rather put an onerous interest burden of up to 8.604% annually on the government for the next decade, amounting to around $2bn on a $3bn loan. The IMF also refuses to restructure sovereign debt. The solution, the author argues, is for Sri Lanka to form a coalition with other debtor nations and collectively resist repayment, just as rural women have done to predatory microfinance companies.
