    "What people normally do is complete the other six summits before attempting Mt. Everest. I did it in reverse",
    "Johann Peries is a name familiar to Sri Lankans. As the second Sri Lankan to have sumitted Mount Everest, Johann\u2019s journey is a testament to his unyielding spirit, passion and dedication. He is now on a quest to conquer the Seven Summits challenge\u2014summiting the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Johann shared his experiences, insights and the spiritual connection he has with the mountains, offering a glimpse into the mind of a mountaineer who pushes the boundaries of human endurance.",
    "Following are excerpts of the interview:",
    "Is it true that the tougher the climb, the better the view?",
    "I don\u2019t think the view depends on that. I would say the tougher the climb, the greater the achievement. With a tougher climb comes greater challenges and difficulties, which lead to a greater sense of accomplishment.",
    "In your mountaineering experience, which view has been the best thus far?",
    "The view from Everest is similar to flying in a plane. You are above the clouds and surrounded by peaks rising to 7,000-8,000 metres and the sunlight. It\u2019s an amazing view, much like what you see from an airplane, but with your feet on the solid ground.",
    "During my second summit of Mt. Everest in 2018, it was described as one of the best days in 15 or 18 years. There wasn\u2019t a single cloud in sight. It felt like I was gazing into eternity, with an endless horizon. On one side was Nepal and on the other was China. What truly amased me was that the horizon wasn\u2019t straight. I initially thought I was hallucinating due to the lack of oxygen, but I was actually seeing the curvature of the Earth. It was a breathtaking realisation that I was at the top of the world, looking down at the Earth. It always makes me sentimental when I talk about it, knowing that only about 6,000 people in the world have reached the summit of Mt. Everest.",
    "You have mentioned that you are a spiritual person, so when you were at the summit of Mt. Everest and looking at the horizon, what crossed your mind?",
    "I am a spiritual person and spirituality has played a huge role in everything I do. I believe it has given me the strength, courage, and power to achieve what I have. Without that, I feel I would never have accomplished what I did.",
    "Johann at Mt Denali, Alaska",
    "Being a spiritual person, the entire journey felt spiritual. It was something that was prophesied to me\u2014that I would return to Mt. Everest for a second time. I didn\u2019t want to return because I knew how challenging it was. When I went the first time, I witnessed people dying in front of me and had to literally climb over dead bodies. Deciding to return was a huge decision with the constant risk that I might not come back. I had to meditate, pray, and seek guidance on whether I should go. I received a prophecy that I had to undertake this journey.",
    "When I reached the summit for the second time, the first thing I did was lift my hands and thank God, because I knew that the entire journey had been created and set apart for me. Every mountain I climb is a spiritual journey. While it is a worldly notion that the higher you go, the closer you get to God, the experiences I\u2019ve had up there have been deeply personal and spiritually profound.",
    "You carry 50 kg of gear and must manage everything yourself",
    "I know this question has probably been asked at every interview, but how did your journey in mountaineering begin?",
    "My passion for climbing, connecting with the outdoors, and adventure began when I was very young\u2014around five or six years old. My family was always exploring and going on adventures. As a teenager, around 16 or 17 years old, I started climbing mountains in Sri Lanka with my dad. We would camp out, conquer mountains and visit places where people wouldn\u2019t usually venture.",
    "Johann with other climbers at Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa",
    "As I got older, I wanted to take my mountaineering further. I joined friends who enjoyed challenges and whenever a group went out, I joined them to explore mountains abroad. One thing led to another, and eventually, I found myself attempting to summit Mt. Everest; a feat that no one from Sri Lanka had even thought of at the time. It was a huge challenge for Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala and me when we decided to undertake it together.",
    "After summiting Mt. Everest, people kept asking me, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d and I started to ask myself the same question. I\u2019m someone who always seeks new challenges, wants to live life to the fullest, and make the most of every opportunity. So, I decided to take on the Seven Summits challenge.",
    "You\u2019ve completed six of the Seven Summits\u00a0thus far, correct?",
    "I have technically completed six summits. I use the word \u201ctechnically\u201d because, like with Mt. Everest, I was unable to summit two of them. One is Aconcagua in Argentina in 2019, when I went with Jayanthi. We had selected a different route, which was a tough route, and the weather was not the best that day, so we couldn\u2019t complete the final summit.",
    "Last year, when I went to Mount Denali in Alaska\u2014on the last day after 21 days\u2014we were asked to turn back because a storm was coming in, and we had no supplies.",
    "I have the next part of my journey planned out. The final one I am left with is Mount Vinson Massif in Antarctica. I am hoping to leave at the end of this year\u2014by the end of December. The climb is scheduled for the beginning of January. Along with that, I am planning to also attempt the other two summits that I couldn\u2019t complete, and finish everything by May next year. I believe only 350 people in the world have accomplished this. This is significant for us because we are from an island. We don\u2019t have the conditions, and our bodies are not made for these types of challenges. Our bodies are suited for the tropical climate.",
    "Johann Peries at Mt. Everest",
    "Jayanthi\u2019s dream and mine was to take the Sri Lankan flag to the highest point in the world, which we accomplished. My next dream is to conquer the highest points of the seven corners of the world and place the Sri Lankan flag there. It is also something I want to do for the country, because we are known as a very small country. I also want to show the world that we are also great and we can do the things that they do. We have the capability, strength, and determination to do whatever others do, and that is my message to the world.",
    "What was each climb like?",
    "What people normally do is complete the other six summits before attempting Mt. Everest. I did it in reverse because my challenge wasn\u2019t the Seven Summits initially. I considered the Seven Summits only after completing Mt. Everest.",
    "Mt. Everest is the most challenging climb. It\u2019s mentally as challenging as it is physically because you face the reality of death. Seeing dead bodies along the way hits you hard and makes you think that this could also be you. I saw people dying and spoke to someone who died later and all this was mentally challenging. However, you overcome it over time. People asked me, \u2018Weren\u2019t you scared?\u2019 Of course, I was scared. I would be lying if I said I\u2019m never scared when climbing a mountain. There is always a bit of fear. If you don\u2019t have that fear, you\u2019re being arrogant and overconfident. A little fear is beneficial because it makes you take extra precautions, gather more knowledge and undergo thorough training. So, Mt. Everest was the most challenging, spanning a two-month journey.",
    "Australia, on the other hand, was a complete contrast to Mt. Everest. Mount Kosciuszko is the highest point on the Australian continent. Some don\u2019t consider it one of the Seven Summits, but it is. It was like a day picnic. It\u2019s similar to Pidurutalagala, which is 8,000 ft high. It\u2019s a beautiful trek through lovely countryside. The highlight for me was doing it in 2020 with six of my colleagues who had climbed Mt. Everest with me from around the world. We met up for one of their weddings, and decided to climb Mount Kosciuszko together. Although it wasn\u2019t a significant climb, being with that group made it special. The friendships forged on the mountains are lasting. We still meet and keep in touch. I feel a strong bond with them.",
    "Mount Kosciuszko, Australia",
    "Mount Kilimanjaro is often seen as an easier climb, but I advise against underestimating it. Altitude affects you because it\u2019s done in a short timeframe\u2014eight days. It\u2019s quite challenging, but many people do it. There are different routes, and it\u2019s a beautiful mountain.",
    "Mount Elbrus in Russia was also stunning. The organization and logistics were remarkable; everything was planned out perfectly. It worked like clockwork. It was another beautiful mountain, being the highest point in Europe.",
    "Aconcagua in South America was tough because it\u2019s the highest mountain outside the Himalayas at 7,000 metres. It\u2019s quite challenging but absolutely stunning.",
    "Mount Denali in Alaska was extremely demanding. You carry 50 kg of gear and must manage everything yourself. You have about 20 kg on your back and pull a sled through snow and ice, which can be knee-deep. It\u2019s exhausting, and you have to set everything up yourself upon arrival.",
    "The difference between Mount Denali and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, compared to most other climbs, is the lack of support. At Mt. Denali and Vinson Massif, you carry all your supplies. Mt. Vinson is a 14-day climb, while Mt. Denali takes 21 days. You must carry everything, including supplies, tents, and toilets\u201450 kg up the mountain. This makes it incredibly challenging. I\u2019m currently training hard for this, as I plan to tackle all three again. One of the biggest challenges is the funding, which has increased threefold since our Mt. Everest expedition due to the rise in the Dollar. However, I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll secure corporate sponsorships and support from Sri Lankans to take the Sri Lankan flag to the Seven Summits.",
    "How exactly do you plan on conquering the three summits in January next year?",
    "When I go to Mount Vinson, I will stay there and also travel to Argentina, as they are in close proximity. Completing both will take about two months. It\u2019s a massive commitment, and securing the necessary funding is crucial. After that, I\u2019ll return because my body will need to recover; Mt. Denali is very tough. I plan to go back in May 2024 for Denali. Hopefully, by the end of summer, I will have completed all seven summits, and we can celebrate.",
    "What\u2019s the first thing you will be doing once you\u2019re back in Sri Lanka?",
    "I\u2019ll go to the beach and get some sun! I tend to take a break for about two or three days and always try to visit a nice sunny location to help my body adjust back to normal. Although, my body has really adapted to the cold now; I keep getting complaints from my clients that the salon is too cold!",
    "Are there any other challenges that you\u2019d like to take on after the Seven Summits?",
    "I\u2019m not thinking about it just yet. I plan to take a break before considering any new challenges. However, I\u2019d like to explore other opportunities as well. There\u2019s so much to do and so many places to explore around the world. New Zealand is one place I\u2019d really like to visit again. I recently came back from New Zealand, but unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to do any climbing. There are also many other places I haven\u2019t explored yet, like Siberia.",
    "How did yours and Jayanthi\u2019s friendship come about?",
    "In 2010, I went to the Mt. Everest base camp with a group of friends and returned successfully. At that point, I remember standing at base camp with a friend, and the journey was extremely difficult. It took 14 days. When we got there, we were asked if we could go a little bit further into the camps, and we said we were not taking a step further. It was so difficult! We could see these tiny little black dots in the Khumbu Icefall \u2013 those were the people trying to summit Mt. Everest. That amazed me, and I was thinking how mad they were and why they would take this risk. Never did I think that in six years I would be doing the same thing. I had no intention at that time because it seemed so dangerous. But in 2012, I went to a mountain called Island Peak, which is close to Everest, and one of my friends was talking to me and said that there is this other girl who loves climbing, and she was sure the two of us would hit it off well together and asked if they could introduce me to her. I said sure, I would love to have company on that trip. And that\u2019s how we met. We went together, really hit it off, and became really close friends.",
    "Has your family been supportive of your summits, or have they been like, \u2018Think about us, don\u2019t put your life in danger deliberately?\u2019",
    "That\u2019s always a concern when it comes to family. When I decided to go to Mt. Everest the second time, the hardest thing was breaking the news to my family. My father was the one who encouraged me. He\u2019s the one who took me climbing for the first time. So the first time when we were going, my mother freaked out and tried to convince my father to stop me. But my father said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that. I am the one who got him into this. We need to encourage him and make sure he is safe.\u201d When I returned the first time, he was there to listen to the whole story. Then he passed away one month after I came back the first time. The second time I went, he wasn\u2019t there, so everyone\u2014my sister, my mother, and others\u2014was trying to stop me from going. They talked to my friends, trying to convince me not to go. So yes, it does take a toll on the family and loved ones. They really go through a lot, even my close friends. They are on edge until I come back.",
    "On one hand you are a mountaineer, which is a high-adrenaline sport, but on the other hand you\u2019re a stylist. Does this bring some semblance of balance into your life?",
    "I think it does. I am not only a hairdresser; I am also a makeup artiste, a stylist, and I design. It is a very challenging and demanding job as well because you\u2019re dealing with customers and their feelings. This is not the only thing I do\u2014I also engage in wedding planning, run a restaurant, and am about to start a new business making wine. So, mountaineering serves as my getaway, providing a chance to find peace and calm my mind from the busy world. Even though it\u2019s a high-adrenaline and challenging sport, I find it relaxing.",
    "Has there ever been a time when you have had to make a critical decision during a climb?",
    "I think the toughest decision I have ever made in my life was in 2016 when I went to Mt. Everest with Jayanthi. We had completed the two-month climb and had just 400 metres remaining to reach the summit\u2014I could literally touch it. But I was told I had to turn back because I didn\u2019t have sufficient oxygen in my tank. That was one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve had to make. My immediate instinct was to ignore the advice and continue towards the summit. However, my Sherpa guide stopped me and urged me to think about the people I had back home. He even got someone on the radio from base camp to talk to me and convince me not to proceed. I sat down, told them all to leave me alone, and went into meditation. I had to ask myself, \u201cIs this it? Is this what you brought me here for?\u201d I weighed the pros and cons: reaching the summit would make me a hero, but I\u2019d be a dead hero. I realised that life is the most precious gift we have, and everything we do is for life. So, I decided to choose life and made the decision to turn back.",
    "When I returned for the second attempt, I had a different Sherpa guide, one with more experience who had reached the summit eight times. This gave me more confidence and strength. My guide was also determined to take me to the summit.",
    "This is a clich\u00e9 question, but is there anything you\u2019d like to say to people who want to pursue the same mountaineering path?",
    "I think mountaineering, hiking and climbing have completely changed in our country in the last five or six years. I believe that us summiting Everest has also changed the perception of lots of people here. Even when we went to corporates to obtain sponsorship, they laughed and said, \u2018You can climb Mount Everest? Sri Lankans?\u2019. They had this perception that we couldn\u2019t do it because we are from an island and we don\u2019t have the ability to do it. So we broke the box and the ceiling and we went through.",
    "If you look at Facebook, you see everybody hiking, and tourism too has taken a completely different turn. I have companies that book me to sometimes take high profile clients on personal hikes and climbs within Sri Lanka. So perception has completely changed. So I think it\u2019s something that is really growing here, and in the near future I\u2019m sure we are going to see lots more people going to Everest and lots more going to do the seven summits.",
    "My message to them is: don\u2019t give up on your dreams, just keep going and if you have the determination, strength, courage, perseverance and commitment, keep that goal in front of you and keep going and you will achieve it.",
    "There will be downfalls, stumbling blocks on the way, but if you keep your focus, you can make it. It is the journey that counts. Sometimes it\u2019s not the end result, but the journey itself is what makes you into the person you want to be."
