    "More people are traveling to space, but the International Space Station can only hold 11 people at a time. The Aurelia Institute, a nonprofit space architecture lab based in Cambridge, MA, has an approach that may help: a habitat that can be launched in compact stacks of flat tiles and self-assemble in orbit. Building large space habitats is difficult. Structural components, like walls, have to fit on a rocket. There\u2019s often not enough room to launch everything in one go. It takes multiple launches to build larger structures, like the ISS, adding to the expense. Once all the components have made it to space, habitats must be constructed by humans, and that\u2019s dangerous work.\u00a0  \u201cIf you rely on a human to help you assemble something, they have to put on an extravehicular suit,\u201d says Aurelia Institute CEO Ariel Ekblaw. \u201cIt's risking their life. We'd love to have this done more safely in the future.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At a co-working space in Roxbury, MA, in early August, the Aurelia Institute showed off a mock-up of a space habitat called TESSERAE. The structure looks like a futuristic, one-story-tall soccer ball. The team described how the station\u2019s tiles, each about six-feet tall and wide, would come together.",
    "The idea is to make the structure as compact as possible for launch. \u201cRight now, anything that goes up is in the very rigid structure of the payload, which is what sits on top of the rocket,\u201d says Stephanie Sjoblom, Aurelia Institute\u2019s vice president of strategy and business development. \u201cWith this technology, we\u2019re creating tiles that we stack kind of like a flat-packed IKEA box.\u201d\u00a0 Following a successful launch, the tiles would be thrown into space in a balloon-like structure or net to stop them from drifting away. The net would keep the tiles, which have strong magnets in their edges, close enough for magnetic attraction. The hope is that the tiles would then snap together on their own into the correct configuration the first time. If they don\u2019t, the team can pulse a current through the magnets to break apart the incorrectly configured tiles and try again. Following assembly, electrical and plumbing systems can be mounted by hand.",
    "Modules and inflatables So far, the team has successfully assembled smaller hand-sized tiles in space several times, including during Axiom Space\u2019s Ax-1 mission to the ISS in 2022. They have yet to build a to-scale model of TESSERAE in space and say that construction would likely require a partner.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to give an accurate figure of how much longer it will take for it to be human-crewed,\u201d says Ekblaw. \u201cIt probably depends on if we get a partnership with NASA or Axiom. But certainly by the 2030s.\u201d Aurelia won\u2019t share how much money they\u2019ve raised or spent on this work, but they said it has been funded in part by NASA grants and corporate sponsorships.\u00a0 There are lots of groups working on space stations. Axiom Space is working on its own orbital station, the first module of which it aims to launch in 2026 and temporarily attach to the ISS. Blue Origin and Sierra Space are working on Orbital Reef, a project to support up to 10 people at a time in a \u201cmixed-use business park.\u201d These stations will rely on humans for their construction, and launching the pieces will probably take a few trips.\u00a0 There\u2019s another way to make something compact for launch: inflate it in orbit. NASA has already done this\u2014its experimental BEAM habitat, which is connected to the ISS, launched in 2016 and has stored cargo. Sierra Space wants to make inflatable habitats as large as a three-story building, although they\u2019ve yet to test these designs in space.\u00a0 Ekblaw sees the TESSERAE habitat and inflatables as complementary technologies. TESSERAE\u2019s hard outer shell should better protect astronauts from space debris, such as micrometeoroids. And the TESSERAE habitat is more easily repaired than an inflatable, she says, because tiles can simply be switched out. That\u2019s not true for inflatables, where a tear may mean a complicated patch job or replacing the entire habitat. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-inflatables,\u201d Ekblaw says. \u201cI think the answer should be both, not either.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Design challenges The Aurelia Institute envisions that, once constructed, the TESSERAE habitat will be quite different from what we usually see at the ISS: not just functional, but also fun, accessible, and comfortable.",
    "The design contains whimsical elements informed by hundreds of interviews with astronauts. One looks like a massive inflatable sea anemone that sticks out of the wall. But it\u2019s actually a couch\u2014lying down in space isn\u2019t easy, so astronauts could, theoretically, wedge themselves between inflatable branches and get cozy.\u00a0 Scaling up the technology will be difficult, though. Oliver Jia-Richards, an aerospace engineer at University of Michigan, isn\u2019t sure whether Aurelia\u2019s combination of magnets and sensors will be enough to get larger tiles to self-assemble. Moving things in space with precision typically requires a propulsion system. \u201cIf they accomplished this, it would be a breakthrough in terms of how we do this,\u201d says Jia-Richards. Ekblaw says she\u2019s not ruling out the need for propulsion.\u00a0\u00a0 The structures the tiles can currently create are also not airtight, and therefore not human-ready, Ekblaw notes. Her team may add latches at the edges of the tiles, which would knit them together more closely. Another idea is to inflate an airtight balloon in the middle of the space for people to live within. In that case, the tiles would become simply an exoskeleton to an interior, pressurized bladder.\u00a0 The team just got approved by NASA to send more small tiles up to the ISS next year. This time, they\u2019ll send up about 32 (rather than just five) and see if they can build an entire spherical structure on a small scale.\u00a0 hide"
