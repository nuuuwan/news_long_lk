    "The \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 was chock full of controversial policies\u2014Medicaid work requirements, increased funding for ICE, and an end to tax credits for clean energy and vehicles, to name just a few. But one highly contested provision was missing. Just days earlier, during a late-night voting session, the Senate had killed the bill\u2019s 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation.\u00a0 \u201cWe really dodged a bullet,\u201d says Scott Wiener, a California state senator and the author of SB 1047, a bill that would have made companies liable for harms caused by large AI models. It was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last year, but Wiener is now working to pass SB 53, which establishes whistleblower protections for employees of AI companies. Had the federal AI regulation moratorium passed, he says, that bill likely would have been dead.  The moratorium could also have killed laws that have already been adopted around the country, including a Colorado law that targets algorithmic discrimination, laws in Utah and California aimed at making AI-generated content more identifiable, and other legislation focused on preserving data privacy and keeping children safe online. Proponents of the moratorium, such OpenAI and Senator Ted Cruz, have said that a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state-level regulations would place an undue burden on technology companies and stymie innovation. Federal regulation, they argue, is a better approach\u2014but there is currently no federal AI regulation in place. Wiener and other state lawmakers can now get back to work writing and passing AI policy, at least for the time being\u2014with the tailwind of a major moral victory at their backs. The movement to defeat the moratorium was impressively bipartisan: 40 state attorneys general signed a letter to Congress opposing the measure, as did a group of over 250 Republican and Democratic state lawmakers. And while congressional Democrats were united against the moratorium, the final nail in its coffin was hammered in by Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, a Tea Party conservative and Trump ally who backed out of a compromise with Cruz at the eleventh hour.",
    "The moratorium fight may have signaled a bigger political shift. \u201cIn the last few months, we\u2019ve seen a much broader and more diverse coalition form in support of AI regulation generally,\u201d says Amba Kak, co\u2013executive director of the AI Now Institute. After years of relative inaction, politicians are getting concerned about the risks of unregulated artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Related StoryA New York legislator wants to pick up the pieces of the dead California AI billThe new bill being drafted in New York aims to regulate advanced AI systems while addressing concerns with the California bill.",
    "Granted, there\u2019s an argument to be made that the moratorium\u2019s defeat was highly contingent. Blackburn appears to have been motivated almost entirely by concerns about children\u2019s online safety and the rights of country musicians to control their own likenesses; state lawmakers, meanwhile, were affronted by the federal government\u2019s attempt to defang legislation that they had already passed.",
    "And even though powerful technology firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI reportedly lobbied in favor of the moratorium, continuing to push for it might not have been worth it to the Trump administration and its allies\u2014at least not at the expense of tax breaks and entitlement cuts. Baobao Zhang, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, says that the administration may have been willing to give up on the moratorium in order to push through the rest of the bill by its self-imposed Independence Day deadline. Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment. OpenAI noted that the company was opposed to a state-by-state approach to AI regulation but did not respond to specific questions regarding the moratorium\u2019s defeat.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost certainly the case that the moratorium\u2019s breadth, as well as its decade-long duration, helped opponents marshall a diverse coalition to their side. But that breadth isn\u2019t incidental\u2014it\u2019s related to the very nature of AI. Blackburn, who represents country musicians in Nashville, and Wiener, who represents software developers in San Francisco, have a shared interest in AI regulation precisely because such a powerful and general-purpose tool has the potential to affect so many people\u2019s well-being and livelihood. \u201cThere are real anxieties that are touching people of all classes,\u201d Kak says. \u201cIt\u2019s creating solidarities that maybe didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d Faced with outspoken advocates, concerned constituents, and the constant buzz of AI discourse, politicians from both sides of the aisle are starting to argue for taking AI extremely seriously. One of the most prominent anti-moratorium voices was Marjorie Taylor Greene, who voted for the version of the bill containing the moratorium before admitting that she hadn\u2019t read it thoroughly and committing to opposing the moratorium moving forward. \u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years,\u201d she posted last month. And two weeks ago, Pete Buttigieg, President Biden\u2019s transportation secretary, published a Substack post entitled \u201cWe Are Still Underreacting on AI.\u201d \u201cThe terms of what it is like to be a human are about to change in ways that rival the transformations of the Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution, only much more quickly,\u201d he wrote. Wiener has noticed a shift among his peers. \u201cMore and more policymakers understand that we can\u2019t just ignore this,\u201d he says. But awareness is several steps short of effective legislation, and regulation opponents aren\u2019t giving up the fight. The Trump administration is reportedly working on a slate of executive actions aimed at making more energy available for AI training and deployment, and Cruz says he is planning to introduce his own anti-regulation bill. Meanwhile, proponents of regulation will need to figure out how to channel the broad opposition to the moratorium into support for specific policies. It won\u2019t be a simple task. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for all of us to agree on what we don\u2019t want,\u201d Kak says. \u201cThe harder question is: What is it that we do want?\u201d  hide"
