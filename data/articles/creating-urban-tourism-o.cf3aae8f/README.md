Governor Hanif Yusoof made an unexpected statement during his speech at the HSBC Ceylon Literary and Arts Festival, highlighting the transformative potential of soft power. He proposed a bold vision of turning Colombo into the cultural hot spot in Sri Lanka. Far from being an abstract idea, Yusoof—a seasoned businessman turned Governor of the Western Province—outlined a pragmatic approach to using Colombo’s cultural vibrancy as a magnet for tourism and development. His point being tourists arriving in the country spend just a day in the capital city and are then wooshed out to the beaches or other sites out of Colombo. How do we make them stay a couple of days in the city?

The concept of building soft power for the capital city, took root in the most fitting of venues: the Colombo Public Library, where the festival became a melting pot of creativity and vision. Ajai Vir Singh of Colombo Fashion Week fame, who is the Co-Founder/Director of the HSBC Ceylon Literary and Arts Festival, stressed that Sri Lanka’s tourism narrative must expand beyond its traditional appeal of sun, sand, and elephants to encompass the rich tapestry of its traditions and creative culture. HSBC has joined forces with Singh and his team to craft this innovative model for contemporary cultural tourism in the city.

“Soft power, unlike hard power, exerts influence subtly but profoundly, reaching into hearts and minds where brute force cannot. Its impact is far-reaching, often crossing cultural and geographical boundaries with ease. Take for example Mumbai which is often labelled the commercial capital of India, I see it as something far more significant—the soft power capital of India,” says Ajai Vir Singh.

“Bollywood is India’s biggest export of cultural influence. It has penetrated corners of the world where India’s hard power hasn’t ventured. From Russian towns during the Soviet era to Syrian taxi cabs, Bollywood music and films resonate globally. The melodies, stories, and emotions of Bollywood have made their way into societies and hearts that India’s hard power could never reach.”

If one takes a closer look at Mumbai, there’s an entire ecosystem built around this cultural powerhouse. The city generates not just films, but a vibrant creative economy. Actors, directors, cameramen, editors, writers, and musicians all converge there, creating a thriving network of industries. From music studios to camera equipment suppliers, from Apple stores catering to creative professionals to costume designers and set builders—Mumbai is the beating heart of India’s creative economy, Singh says.

“This ecosystem fuels more than artistic expression; it drives Mumbai’s economy. People often attribute the city’s financial prowess to its status as a commercial hub. But dig deeper, and you’ll find Bollywood and the creative industries powering a significant chunk of that economy. The taxes paid by this sector, the jobs it creates, and the ripple effect it has across industries make it more than a cultural phenomenon—it’s an economic force. In fact, soft power, when viewed through the lens of tangible impact, translates into a creative economy. And in Mumbai, this creative economy is not just thriving; it’s reshaping perceptions of power. It proves that cultural influence, with its ability to connect emotionally and transcend barriers, can be far more potent than traditional notions of hard power.

According to recent reports, the Bollywood industry’s turnover is expected to reach approximately $ 5 billion by 2024, an incredible leap from its estimated $ 2.3 billion in 2017.

Art has long served as a window into a nation’s soul, showcasing its history, values, and creativity. By elevating traditional crafts, visual arts, and cultural festivals, nations can preserve their heritage while captivating a global audience. But how does this translate into promoting city tourism? Ajai Vir Singh offers an insightful perspective: Sri Lanka has yet to tap into a burgeoning segment of tourism focused on contemporary art, music, and literary experiences.

Burgeoning segment of tourism

He envisions a shift from the well-trodden path of ancient cultural tourism to one that also embraces urban events. Visitors, he argues, will seek out galleries, concerts, and museums, desiring to immerse themselves in the city’s creative pulse. This vision, however, requires a fundamental change in mindset. According to Singh, authorities must embrace the idea of leveraging the soft power of artists, writers, musicians, and thinkers to attract international attention.

Singh’s vision extends beyond local events, advocating for Sri Lanka to engage with the global art scene through exhibitions, and cultural exchanges. Such participation amplifies visibility, positioning the nation as a creative hub while showcasing its rich talent and heritage. Collaborative art programs, such as artist residencies and international exhibitions, could build bridges between cultures, fostering goodwill and dialogue.

For instance, supporting Sri Lankan artists to exhibit abroad or hosting foreign artists for creative collaborations would not only elevate the country’s reputation but also nurture cross-cultural connections. Yet, the question remains: How can Sri Lanka realise this vision? Achieving this goal will require strategic investment, policy reforms, and a commitment to fostering creativity as a vital component of the nation’s identity and economy.

Mita Kapur, the curator of HSBC Ceylon Literary and Arts Festival, and a noted literary figure from Jaipur, India, echoed this sentiment, urging Sri Lanka to showcase its artistic and cultural wealth with pride. She emphasised that the global spotlight is increasingly turning towards the island as a hotspot for tourism, cultural exploration, and creativity, owing to its renowned art, design, and deeply evolved cultural sensibility.

Extraordinary riches and untapped wealth

Kapur believes that Sri Lanka possesses extraordinary riches and untapped wealth in this area. While acknowledging the challenges involved—such as the need for infrastructure, funding, vision, and effective execution—she asserts that these obstacles are not insurmountable. According to her, every new initiative comes with its share of challenges, regardless of the field. Instead of being deterred by the difficulties, she urges Sri Lanka to boldly project itself on the global stage. She emphasises that the country has immense potential to offer the world.

Mita Kapur also stressed the importance of public-private collaboration, noting that such progress cannot rest solely on a government. Multinational corporations, like HSBC, which is already supporting the festival, must play an active role. Only through this collective effort can Sri Lanka fully harness its soft power and position itself confidently on the global stage.

Mark Surgenor, CEO HSBC Sri Lanka noted that Sri Lanka holds immense untapped potential in the field of art and literature. “The country is home to exceptional writers who, despite their talent and contributions, often remain undiscovered on a global stage. While the world has witnessed how a country’s literary accomplishments impact the economy, Sri Lanka’s creative output has not yet been promoted to its fullest extent. Yet, there is a growing curiosity and demand to explore what the country has to offer. This brings us to an essential mission: to foster a cultural exchange that benefits both Sri Lanka and the global literary and arts community. That’s why, through the HSBC Ceylon Literary and Arts festival, our ambition is to bring the ‘Best of the World’ to Sri Lanka and take the best of Sri Lanka to the world.”

Surgenor says the idea is simple but powerful. “By inviting some of the world’s most acclaimed writers and artists to Sri Lanka and pairing them with some of the finest literary minds on the island, we have created a space where ideas can converge. This isn’t just about showcasing talent—it’s about encouraging collaboration, sharing perspectives and best practices which sparks innovation in storytelling. It’s about creating a fusion of ideas, a melting pot where local and global narratives can blend to inspire new possibilities.

The results speak for themselves. Participants at the festival have expressed how much they’ve enjoyed these sessions, not just for the thought-provoking insights they’ve gained but also for stories on personal challenges writers and artists embraced and further, a chance to engage in meaningful dialogue. Writers have exchanged ideas, built on one another’s thoughts, and pushed boundaries together. This collaborative energy is what makes the world richer, fostering a shared understanding that transcends cultural and geographic divides.

Ultimately, this is about more than literature, it’s about global connections, creativity, and the belief that when people come together to share, they make the world a better place. By bringing Sri Lanka’s literary and artistic talents into the global spotlight and inviting the world’s best to experience what we have to offer, we’re setting the stage for something extraordinary. As the leading international bank with a longstanding presence in Sri Lanka for more than 130 years, it is both a privilege and a responsibility to contribute to the nation’s growth and prosperity,” he added.

Literature and literacy programs offer profound avenues for building soft power. By showcasing national writers, poets, and thinkers on global platforms such as literary festivals or international book fairs, countries can project their intellectual and cultural identity.

Stories and literature serve as tools of cultural storytelling, communicating a nation’s history, values, and aspirations in ways that foster empathy and understanding. Translation initiatives, which make national literature accessible in multiple languages, are critical in expanding its global reach and impact.

Lack of infrastructure

Ashok Ferrey, a Sri Lankan novelist says, “Sri Lankans possess immense talent in writing, but unfortunately, it often goes unappreciated or underappreciated due to several key challenges. One major issue is the lack of infrastructure to support the literary process. We don’t have enough editors, proofreaders, or publishers to help writers refine and elevate their work. While there are some publishers, they are too few to meet the demand.

What we particularly lack are skilled editors—something that’s crucial in other parts of the world. In places like London, for instance, books on the shelves are often the result of rigorous editing and rewriting, sometimes going through dozens of drafts. In contrast, here in Sri Lanka, writers tend to release their work after the first or second draft, often due to impatience or the absence of professional guidance. This is not the fault of the writers—it’s a reflection of the gaps in the system.

However, Ferrey says with just a bit more support, Sri Lankan writers could go so far. “This is, after all, an island of stories. Everyone here seems to be a natural storyteller, in the truest sense of the word. Something as ordinary as a small incident in someone’s home today can, by tomorrow, be transformed into a beautifully polished tale that makes people laugh, cry, or reflect.”

To effectively harness the transformative potential of soft power, experts emphasise the need for a strategic approach that involves several key components. First government and institutional support is crucial. Additionally, public-private partnerships play a vital role in ensuring the sustainability and broader reach of cultural initiatives. By collaborating with corporations and NGOs, nations can secure the funding and resources needed for large-scale cultural events, such as festivals or the promotion of local artists, creating a synergy between private and public ambitions.

Developing infrastructure is vital to nurturing cultural growth. Investments in museums, libraries, performance venues, and digital platforms create essential spaces for artistic and cultural expression, making them more accessible to the public. Additionally, embracing technology plays an increasingly crucial role in connecting with global audiences. Innovations like virtual art galleries, online music streaming, and e-books eliminate geographical limitations, allowing cultural products to reach anyone, anywhere. Together, these initiatives establish a vibrant, globally connected cultural ecosystem—one that has the potential to position Colombo City and the Western Province of Sri Lanka as key destinations for urban tourism.
