1. How does Menges's computational design work in predicting the behavior of wood in a structure?
2. What are some possible challenges or limitations of implementing "self-shaping" timber structures?
3. What are the implications of Menges's work on the sustainability of timber buildings?
4. How do the "self-shaping" techniques add to the cost-effectiveness of building construction?
5. Could the self-shaping techniques be applied to other materials besides wood? 
6. How does the HygroShell's design and construction help demonstrate the potential of Mengesâ€™ approach? 
7. How might the use of computational design change the way architects and designers view and use materials with inherent imprecisions, like wood?
8. What are the possible fire safety implications of using less wood in mass-timber buildings, as suggested by Michael Green?
9. How did Menges's interest in pinecones help shape his approach to self-shaping structures?
10. What more can be done to promote the sustainable and efficient use of wood in building construction?
