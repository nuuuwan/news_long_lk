Opinions:

- Simply encouraging team members to voice their opinions does not necessarily foster an open environment. They will only do so if they feel it's safe.

- Asking direct report "What do you think?" can feel like a trap to employees. 
- It's important for leaders to publicly endorse someone as this can shape whether they get heard by others. 
- Managers who fail to give credit to individuals and instead credit the entire team are demotivating their employees. 
- Effective leadership involves recognizing individual team members and bringing out their best insights and effort. 
- Managers need to remove obstacles preventing team members from voicing their opinions. They should also pave the way for employees to take inherent risks involved in sharing their thoughts and concerns.
