# How to Get Your Team to Actually Speak Up

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts: 

- A leader named Jim was seen as unapproachable by his team, despite believing otherwise. His team members expressed feeling unsupported and believed the timelines set for them were unreasonable. 
- Jim was rated lowest in the leadership competency of "creating psychological safety" by his team.
- Leaders need to understand the factors that prevent people from speaking up in the workplace, such as power dynamics, respect-culture, and self-preservation strategies.  
- A standard set of questions should be used to invite perspectives from team members and avoid catching employees off guard. 
- Managers should be specific about communication avenues and channels, otherwise saying "my door is always open" may be ambiguous. 
- People from minority backgrounds in an organization may find it more challenging to speak up due to biases and underestimation. Leaders can support them by deliberately giving them the floor and reinforcing their messages. 
- Failing to acknowledge individual contributions in favor of team wins can demotivate employees and incline them towards silence. 
- Managers need to actively remove communication obstacles for their team members to promote an organizational culture of voice rather than silence. 

Opinions:

- Simply encouraging team members to voice their opinions does not necessarily foster an open environment. They will only do so if they feel it's safe. 
- Telling someone to "speak up" without understanding why they choose to remain quiet doesn't help, and rarely encourages the feedback that managers want. 
- Asking direct report "What do you think?" can feel like a trap to employees. 
- It's important for leaders to publicly endorse someone as this can shape whether they get heard by others. 
- Managers who fail to give credit to individuals and instead credit the entire team are demotivating their employees. 
- Effective leadership involves recognizing individual team members and bringing out their best insights and effort. 
- Managers need to remove obstacles preventing team members from voicing their opinions. They should also pave the way for employees to take inherent risks involved in sharing their thoughts and concerns.

There is a common leadership misconception that merely encouraging team members to voice their opinions will foster an environment of openness. But people won‚Äôt speak up unless they feel safe doing so. As a leader, this means you have to address the...more

Jim saw himself as an approachable leader: low in ego and interested in different perspectives. He thought he made it clear that he wanted his team to speak up. Time and again, he reminded them, ‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs going on so we can course correct early.‚Äù But whether in groups or one-on-one, people stayed silent.

Jim (not his real name) would then hear second-hand from his peers in different departments that his direct reports thought the timelines he set were unreasonable and the team didn‚Äôt feel supported. His company-initiated 360 feedback confirmed that Jim was part of the problem: He was rated lowest on the leadership competency ‚Äúcreates psychological safety‚Äù from those who reported to him.

What Jim ‚Äî and so many other leaders ‚Äî get wrong is that just telling someone to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù without understanding why they choose to stay silent doesn‚Äôt actually help anyone, and rarely encourages the feedback they want. Instead, leaders need to think about the issues, both individual and systemic, that prevent people from speaking up, whether it‚Äôs offering a different perspective in a brainstorm or raising a concern about the strategic direction of the company. Those issues may include a culture that equates silence with respect, the power differentials between managers and employees, and the fact that learned silence is often a survival strategy for many people in the workplace.

Whether or not to speak up often comes down to a subconscious calculation. Do the benefits of speaking up outweigh the real and perceived costs of doing so? If not, it will feel safer to stay silent.

To help employees speak up ‚Äî and feel safe doing so ‚Äî managers need to recognize their role in creating a culture of transparency and trust, instead of preserving (maybe even inadvertently) a culture that doesn‚Äôt support all voices. They also need to provide alternative paths that feel safe for employees to say what‚Äôs on their minds. In my work with leaders at companies on six continents, across industries, and at different levels of seniority, I‚Äôve seen several tactics that work. Below are ones that managers can start with.

Make clear that you want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. But note that you should only ask for the level of candor that you‚Äôre actually ready and able to receive. Managers can say ‚ÄúI want to hear how things are really going and what you truly think, rather than what you think I want to hear. The only way we can make sound decisions together is if we all know what‚Äôs actually going on.‚Äù

Without a clear and repeated articulation of what you hope to hear from them, there‚Äôs no reason that they‚Äôd be willing to take the risk to find out whether they‚Äôve crossed a line. It‚Äôs important that you back up your requests with your actions. If you get defensive or ignore the input employees share, they are unlikely to share again.

Use Standard Questions

Asking a direct report ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù can feel like a trap. Employees often wonder, ‚ÄúDo they really want to know? What are the repercussions if I say something they don‚Äôt want to hear?‚Äù Instead, use a standard set of complementary questions to repeatedly invite perspective. For example, you might ask: What are the pros of this idea? What are the cons? What about this idea works/doesn‚Äôt work? You‚Äôll adjust the questions depending on what input you‚Äôre asking for and the culture of your organization. Regardless of the exact wording, using standard questions like these establishes important norms such as analyzing issues from multiple perspectives and expressing potentially dissenting options. This practice also makes sure that you‚Äôre not catching employees off guard. When they expect you to ask those questions, they can be prepared ahead of time to share their opinion.

Discuss Communication Preferences

Figuring out where, when, and how to speak up creates an additional hurdle for employees when doing their calculation. Managers can make it easier by clarifying the avenues for input. While saying ‚Äúmy door is always open‚Äù might be well intentioned, it‚Äôs far better to be specific. For example, you might say, ‚ÄúIf thoughts come up after our meeting, reply all on the email thread so everyone has visibility into how the conversation is evolving and we can all move quickly.‚Äù

Better yet, ask employees what communication channels make it easiest for them to share their perspectives. You can simply ask people in your one-on-ones, ‚ÄúWhat channels make it easiest for you to share your thoughts? Do you prefer talking or typing your ideas out? Is it better for you if the conversation is real-time or asynchronous?‚Äù Humans are all wired differently, so different mediums will play to different peoples‚Äô strengths. If you use the mediums that play to theirs rather than yours, they‚Äôre more likely to take action.

People who are in the minority in your organization, whether because of their gender, race, ability, or any other identity, are more likely to be underestimated, interrupted, and othered ‚Äî making it even more risky for them to speak up. You can help to disrupt the biases and increase the likelihood that they‚Äôll share their thoughts and opinions by deliberately giving them the floor, publicly articulating why you think people should listen to them, and reinforcing the employee‚Äôs message after the fact.

Here‚Äôs how those first two tactics might sound: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve asked Ching-En to present today because she is closest to the data and understands the details better than anyone I know.‚Äù Your public endorsement of someone can shape whether they get heard by others.

Attribute Work Accurately

Working hard on something only to have someone else on the team take credit for your work is demeaning and demotivating, and inclines employees toward silence. If someone is going to co-opt your ideas and insights as their own, why would you share them in the first place?

Many managers try to cultivate team cohesion by celebrating wins as team wins. But failing to acknowledge individual contributions, which are often the grounds for promotion, bonuses, or merit increases, can do the opposite.

Accurately give credit to the individuals who did the work, especially when someone tries to attribute it to you. This may be a simple statement like, ‚ÄúI have to give credit to Saleema for that insight.‚Äù Recognizing the people on your team doesn‚Äôt diminish the team‚Äôs or your own success. In fact, it‚Äôs a mark of effective leadership when you‚Äôre able to bring forth an employee‚Äôs best insight and effort.

Urging people to share candid feedback and speak up with their thoughts is simply not enough. Managers need to actively remove obstacles and pave the way for people to take the inherent risks involved in voicing their opinions and concerns. The actions above can change the calculations employees make in deciding whether it‚Äôs worthwhile to share their perspectives and help to create an organizational culture of voice rather than silence.
