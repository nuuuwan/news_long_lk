2. Can you elaborate on the psychological aspect that makes consumers perceive a specific non-rounded discount as a limited-time offer?
3. What is the impact of discounts on customer loyalty? Do customers who are attracted to a store by discounts continue to shop there once the discounts are over?
4. How often do shoppers purchase items they otherwise wouldn't due to discounts? 
5. How effective are discounts in getting consumers to switch from their preferred retailers?
6. What are some of the other strategies that retailers use apart from discounting to attract customers and drive sales?
7. Could you provide examples of the kind of products tested in the studies and their respective discount depths? 
8. Can this precise discount strategy be applicable to all product categories or it works better with specific ones? If so, which ones? 
9. You mentioned that 90% of consumers reported stocking up on groceries when they were on sale. Are there any statistics available about how this behavior affects sales once the products are no longer on sale? 
10. By how much, on average, can a precise discount increase sales? Does it depend upon the type of the product?
