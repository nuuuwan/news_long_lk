The global drive for gender equality in leadership and business took centre stage at the recent International Women’s Day 2025 program organised by the CMA Women’s Leadership Committee. The event, which featured key industry leaders and professionals, highlighted the persistent challenges women face in corporate leadership and the necessary steps to ensure greater inclusivity in management roles.

A call for equality and empowerment

Port of Colombo Chief Commercial Officer of Colombo West International Terminal Dhashma Karunaratne in her keynote address, emphasised that true gender parity in business leadership requires both policy changes and cultural shifts. She noted that while women have made significant strides in the corporate world, entrenched biases and structural barriers continue to hinder their full participation at all levels of hierarchy.

“Leadership must be redefined to recognise the strengths that diversity brings. Women bring resilience, adaptability, and innovation—qualities that modern businesses need to thrive in an evolving global economy. Women should be self-assured, embrace self-development as part of their aspirations, and not feel the need to mimic other women or men in leadership positions. This will help them carve their niche in a mostly male-dominated workplace,” she said.

The panel discussion, moderated by CMA Women’s Leadership Committee Member and Nippon Paint Lanka Head of Business Excellence and Procurement Iranthi Perera focused on the multi-faceted approach needed to empower women in the workforce. The conversation revolved around four key pillars—education, mentorship, cultural shifts, and systemic reforms—which are critical in encouraging confidence and leadership among women.

CMA Sri Lanka Women’s Leadership Committee Chairperson and Deloitte Partners Director Darshini Watawala highlighted a disturbing trend in professional retention, pointing out that while women make up 50% of finance and accounting students, only 25% reach membership status in professional bodies. She attributed this decline to structural barriers, workplace biases, and a lack of mentorship programs designed to support women’s career advancement. She urged institutions to bridge this gap by offering structured mentorship programs and leadership training to help women sustain their professional growth.

Adding to the discussion, Port of Colombo Chief Commercial Officer of Colombo West International Terminal Dhashma Karunaratne Stephen provided insights into gender disparities in male-dominated industries, particularly in the maritime and logistics sectors. She noted that although organisations have made efforts to increase female participation, achieving true gender parity requires more than just numerical representation—it demands inclusive policies, flexible work environments, and targeted recruitment strategies. She also pointed out that automation and technological advancements could serve as equalisers, allowing women to access opportunities traditionally reserved for men.

SAFA Women’s Leadership Committee Chairperson Chamila Cooray emphasised that education is the foundation of confidence, stating that individuals cannot excel in fields where they lack knowledge and exposure. She stressed that leadership and empowerment stem from continuous learning and professional development.

National Development Bank PLC (NDB) Vice President – Human Resources Lasantha Dasanayaka spoke about the importance of negotiation skills and assertive communication, emphasising that many women hesitate to advocate for themselves due to cultural conditioning. He observed that Sri Lankan women are often socialised to be modest and accommodating, which can work against them in professional settings. He advised young professionals to develop strong negotiation skills, seek mentorship, and build confidence in their abilities.

CMA Sri Lanka Director – Examinations Madumi Perera Ginigaddarage noted that while women have increasingly pursued finance and accounting careers, many struggle to break through the glass ceiling and reach top executive roles. She attributed this to a mix of workplace policies, societal expectations, and self-imposed limitations. She emphasised the need for policy interventions that not only encourage female participation but also actively create pathways for women to transition from mid-level roles to leadership positions.

Chartered Architect/Entrepreneur Aruni R. Malalasekera reinforced the idea that success is based on skill and knowledge, not gender. She shared her own experiences in architecture, where the industry values creativity and expertise over gender distinctions. She encouraged aspiring female leaders to focus on building technical competencies while also developing their personal brand and leadership skills.

The discussion underscored the reality that empowerment is not solely the responsibility of institutions or governments—it also requires women to take charge of their own careers, seek opportunities, and push beyond societal limitations. The panellists agreed that while cultural and systemic barriers exist, women must proactively build their networks, enhance their negotiation skills, and take calculated risks to achieve their full potential. They also called for a collaborative effort among policymakers, educational institutions, and corporate leaders to ensure that women have equal access to leadership opportunities and economic participation.

The session concluded on a powerful note, reinforcing that education, mentorship, and systemic change must work together to create a more equitable professional landscape for women. The insights shared by the panellists served as a call to action for both individuals and organisations to take concrete steps toward gender inclusivity and leadership development.

A future of inclusive leadership

As Sri Lanka and the global business community move forward, it’s clear that women’s leadership is essential to sustainable economic growth. Businesses that embrace gender diversity will not only encourage a more equitable work environment but will also gain a competitive edge in an increasingly complex marketplace.

The event concluded with a call to action: organisations must redefine workplace policies, offer leadership development programs, and actively challenge biases. With insights from trailblazers, CMA Sri Lanka’s International Women’s Day forum reinforced the urgency of sustained efforts in achieving true gender equity in leadership.
