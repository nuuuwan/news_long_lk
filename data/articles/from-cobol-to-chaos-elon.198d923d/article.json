    "In trying to make sense of the wrecking ball that is Elon Musk and President Trump\u2019s DOGE, it may be helpful to think about the Evil Housekeeper Problem. It\u2019s a principle of computer security roughly stating that once someone is in your hotel room with your laptop, all bets are off. Because the intruder has physical access, you are in much more trouble. And the person demanding to get into your computer may be standing right beside you. So who is going to stop the evil housekeeper from plugging a computer in and telling IT staff to connect it to the network?  What happens if someone comes in and tells you that you\u2019ll be fired unless you reveal the authenticator code from your phone, or sign off on a code change, or turn over your PIV card, the Homeland Security\u2013approved smart card used to access facilities and systems and securely sign documents and emails? What happens if someone says your name will otherwise be published in an online list of traitors? Already the new administration is firing, putting on leave, or outright escorting from the building people who refuse to do what they\u2019re told.\u00a0 Related StoryGovernment technology is famously bad. It doesn\u2019t have to be.New York City is fixing the relationship between government and technology\u2013and not in the ways you\u2019d expect.",
    "It\u2019s incredibly hard to protect a system from someone\u2014the evil housekeeper from DOGE\u2014who has made their way inside and wants to wreck it. This administration is on the record as wanting to outright delete entire departments. Accelerationists are not only setting policy but implementing it by working within the administration. If you can\u2019t delete a department, then why not just break it until it doesn\u2019t work?",
    "That\u2019s why what DOGE is doing is a massive, terrifying problem, and one I talked through earlier in a thread on Bluesky.\u00a0 Government is built to be stable. Collectively, we put systems and rules in place to ensure that stability. But whether they actually deliver and preserve stability in the real world isn\u2019t actually about the technology used; it\u2019s about the people using it. When it comes down to it, technology is a tool to be used by humans for human ends. The software used to run our democratically elected government is deployed to accomplish goals tied to policies: collecting money from people, or giving money to states so they can give money to people who qualify for food stamps, or making covid tests available to people.",
    "Usually, our experience of government technology is that it\u2019s out of date or slow or unreliable. Certainly not as shiny as what we see in the private sector. And that technology changes very, very slowly, if it happens at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as if people don\u2019t realize these systems could do with modernization. In my experience troubleshooting and modernizing government systems in California and the federal government, I worked with Head Start, Medicaid, child welfare, and logistics at the Department of Defense. Some of those systems were already undergoing modernization attempts, many of which were and continue to be late, over budget, or just plain broken. But the changes that are needed to make other systems more modern were frequently seen as too risky or too expensive. In other words, not important enough.\u00a0 Of course, some changes are deemed important enough. The covid-19 pandemic and our unemployment insurance systems offer good examples. When covid hit, certain critical government technologies suddenly became visible. Those systems, like unemployment insurance portals, also became politically important, just like the launch of the Affordable Care Act website (which is why it got so much attention when it was botched).\u00a0 Political attention can change everything. During the pandemic, suddenly it wasn\u2019t just possible to modernize and upgrade government systems, or to make them simpler, clearer, and faster to use. It actually happened. Teams were parachuted in. Overly restrictive rules and procedures were reassessed and relaxed. Suddenly, government workers were allowed to work remotely and to use Slack.  However, there is a reason this was an exception.\u00a0 In normal times, rules and procedures are certainly part of what makes it very, very hard to change government technology. But they are in place to stop changes because, well, changes might break those systems and government doesn\u2019t work without them working consistently.\u00a0 A long time ago I worked on a mainframe system in California\u2014the kind that uses COBOL. It was as solid as a rock and worked day in, day out. Because if it didn\u2019t, and reimbursements weren\u2019t received for Medicaid, then the state might become temporarily insolvent.\u00a0 That\u2019s why many of the rules about technology in government make it hard to make changes: because sometimes the risk of things breaking is just too high. Sometimes what\u2019s at stake is simply keeping money flowing; sometimes, as with 911, lives are on the line.",
    "Still, government systems and the rules that govern them are ultimately only as good as the people who oversee and enforce them. The technology will only do (and not do) what people tell it to. So if anyone comes in and breaks those rules on purpose\u2014without fear of consequence\u2014there are few practical or technical guardrails to prevent it.\u00a0 One system that\u2019s meant to do that is the ATO, or the Authority to Operate. It does what it says: It lets you run a computer system. You are not supposed to operate a system without one.\u00a0 But DOGE staffers are behaving in a way that suggests they don\u2019t care about getting ATOs. And nothing is really stopping them. (Someone on Bluesky replied to me: \u201cMy first thought about the OPM [email] server was, \u201cthere\u2019s no way those fuckers have an ATO.\u201d)\u00a0 You might think that there would be technical measures to stop someone right out of high school from coming in and changing the code to a government system. That the system could require two-factor authentication to deploy the code to the cloud. That you would need a smart card to log in to a specific system to do that. Nope\u2014all those technical measures can be circumvented by coercion at the hands of the evil housekeeper.\u00a0 Indeed, none of our systems and rules work without enforcement, and consequences flowing from that enforcement. But to an unprecedented degree, this administration, and its individual leaders, have shown absolutely no fear. That\u2019s why, according to Wired, the former X and SpaceX engineer and DOGE staffer Marko Elez had the \u201cability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS).\u201d (Elez reportedly resigned yesterday after the Wall Street Journal began reporting on a series of racist comments he had allegedly made.) We\u2019re seeing in real time that there are no practical technical measures preventing someone from taking a spanner to the technology that keeps our government stable, that keeps society running every day\u2014despite the very real consequences.\u00a0 So we should plan for the worst, even if the likelihood of the worst is low.\u00a0 We need a version of the UK government\u2019s National Risk Register, covering everything from the collapse of financial markets to \u201can attack on government\u201d (but, unsurprisingly, that risk is described in terms of external threats). The register mostly predicts long-term consequences, with recovery taking months. That may end up being the case here.",
    "We need to dust off those \u201cin the event of an emergency\u201d disaster response procedures dealing with the failure of federal government\u2014at individual organizations that may soon hit cash-flow problems and huge budget deficits without federal funding, at statehouses that will need to keep social programs running, and in groups doing the hard work of archiving and preserving data and knowledge. In the end, all we have is each other\u2014our ability to form communities and networks to support, help, and care for each other. Sometimes all it takes is for the first person to step forward, or to say no, and for us to rally around so it\u2019s easier for the next person. In the end, it\u2019s not about the technology\u2014it\u2019s about the people.
