Expatriate employees in multinational corporations depend heavily on the support of local employees to succeed in their roles. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding and recognition of the importance these local colleagues play in international assignments. The performance of expatriates can be a significant factor in career progression within the company. However, failure in these roles can be detrimental to both the expatriate and their family. The performance of expatriates is influenced by many variables, with the role of host-country national colleagues often overlooked or undervalued.
