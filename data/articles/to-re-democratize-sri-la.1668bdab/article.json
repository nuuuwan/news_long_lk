    "A demand at the \u2018Gota Go-home\u2019 campaign was to get rid of the Executive Presidency system",
    "The latent public detest towards Executive Presidency exploded with the slogan \u2018Gota\u00a0 go Home\u2019 chanted at the historic \u2018Peaceful new generation \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 in 2022",
    "As a voter and a stakeholder in the country\u2019s governance and electoral system /process, the writer was enlivened by a clarion call in the press by a group of lawyers, academics and civil rights activists to abolish the Executive Presidency.",
    "To my knowledge, this was a specific demand by a political party as far back as in 1994 to support a major party which was heading towards victory in the General Election of 1994. This popular promise was quickly picked up by all political parties in the fray as their main \u2018Election carrot\u2019 offered to the populace. Alas! it still remains on the back burner for the last 30 years signifying the \u2018truthfulness\u2019 of our traditionally cunning and power-greedy politicians!",
    "The latent public detest towards Executive Presidency exploded with the slogan \u2018Gota go Home\u2019 chanted at the historic \u2018Peaceful new generation \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 in 2022. I am pretty sure that almost all the members in the said group were \u2018heart and soul\u2019\u00a0 with the \u2018Aragalaya\u2019s desperate call to abolish the \u2018Executive Presidency\u2019 as well as with the call to \u2018Ditch the 225\u2019 through a \u2018System change\u2019 to our outdated political and electoral systems. It is unfortunate that the said group including the religious leaders were unable to pick the fallen baton of \u2018System change\u2019 from the \u2018Aragalya\u2019 for reasons best known to them.",
    "At the outset, despite my unwavering advocacy to abolish the Executive Presidency, I beg to differ from the stance that \u2018The only way \u2018system change\u2019 can even begin to be delivered is by abolishing the executive presidency\u2019. On the contrary, at this crucial juncture with a \u2018Hobsons Choice\u2019, it is the best tool to leverage\u00a0 the quick passage of positive\u00a0 and critical \u2018System changes\u2019 stated below, and\u00a0 lay the turf\u00a0 for\u00a0 the next General and PC Elections as desired by the intelligent voters and the new generation who cannot wait for another 5 years! Ample testimony to this potentiality is found in the almost unanimous passage of 19th and 21st Amendments in the Parliament despite the governing Party having less than 113 seats on both occasions.",
    "Be that as it may, the more important issue is to forge the alternative for Executive Presidency. The writer\u2019s alternative arising out of proper home work was published in the press on 4 June 2022 under the title\u00a0 \u2018An open letter to peaceful and intelligent protestors on \u2018System changes\u2019 to remove the curse of the-\u2018225\u2019.\u00a0 The relevant excerpt is as follows.",
    "\u201c Alternate proposal in the present context",
    "Abolish the Executive Presidency and the 20th Amendment and restore the 19th Amendment after suitable changes together with additional amendments including those necessary to provide for a \u2018Parliament elected\u00a0 Presidency\u2019 with additional powers to ensure the execution of the laws as well as programmes in the \u2018Election Manifesto\u2019 of the Governing Party and implementation of Parliamentary and Decentralised Budgets through the Provincial Councils headed by Provincial Governors, as and when approved by the Parliament \u201d",
    "The rest of the article was dedicated to a summary of a holistic package of simple \u2018system changes\u2019 ending with the following concluding note.",
    "This holistic package of \u2018System Changes\u2019\u00a0 is aimed at providing a Democratic, Patriotic, Simple, and a\u00a0 cost-effective\u00a0 alternative with minimum changes to the existing complex \u2018MMV System\u2019, in order to make it possible for an interim-govt. mechanism to approve under the 21st or 22nd Amendment, sans a Referendum andbefore holding the next General and other Elections.",
    "If not, the curse of the \u2018225\u2019 will perpetuate throwing our motherland to the dustbin of history!\u201d",
    "Since over 2 years have now passed, the writer, wishes to place the following updated summary of his package of \u2018system changes\u2019 to our political and Electoral systems for easy reference of the said learned lawyers, academics and civil rights activists including the \u2018country loving\u2019 readers.",

    "1.

Since this option, was not advanced for 2 years, the Hobson\u2019s choice is,",
    "Option-ii\u00a0 Support the best candidate under the existing system, who as per his/her Election Manifesto, will genuinely ensure legalising relevant specified \u2018New generation-System changes\u2019 within 6 months of appointment to enable holding upcoming General and Provincial Council (PC) elections, and other specified \u2018System changes\u2019 including the abolition of the Executive Presidency within 24 months of his/her appointment.

With the formation of \u2018Independent \u2018Jana Sabhas\u2019(JS) at \u2018Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level, as proposed by National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ),\u00a0 JS nominees would be empowered as per their mission and targets to foster a \u2018People-Based Governance\u2018. Low-cost elections can be conducted by Divisional Secretaries.",
    "4. Install a \u2018Sustainable National Cabinet\u2019 system to foster \u2018Sri Lankan ness\u2019 by allocating portfolios to seat-winning parties based on their National Vote % at a General Election.

    "5. Stipulate specific transparent criteria and methodology for District wise nomination of 29 erudite National List MPs also reflecting multi -Community population ratios. Since they were also intended substitutes for \u2018Senate members\u2019 (Abolished in 1972), unelected candidates at a General Election will not qualify for election under the National List.",
    "6. Brand the \u2018Party Election Manifesto\u2019 as a prosecutable document with a monitorable, time- lined 5 year action plan subject to an Audit procedure, to convince the voter to accept it as the primary determinant for a wise voting decision.",
