Following was sent to me by a very dedicated, loyal and caring young parent who wishes to remain anonymous due to obvious reasons. I sincerely hope you will study it well and take the most appropriate steps – not only because Royal College is both our alma mater – but because it’s one of the priceless assets of the nation and a lasting legacy left behind by the British Empire!

Royal College leadership crisis: A systemic failure at the top?

The departure of Mr. Thilak Waththuhewa, principal of Royal College Colombo, has triggered widespread discussion among stakeholders. While his promotion to a higher position in the Ministry of Education is a testament to his dedication and performance, the situation sheds light on the systemic leadership issues plaguing Sri Lanka’s most prestigious school.

Stakeholders are not questioning the fairness of his promotion; rather, they are grappling with a dual dilemma. On one hand, it is entirely fair and just for Mr. Waththuhewa to accept his earned promotion. On the other hand, the sudden transition is undoubtedly a loss for Royal College, which needs stable and consistent leadership to thrive.

An unfair ask: Retaining the Principal

A message circulating on school-related WhatsApp groups requests Mr. Waththuhewa to forgo his promotion and continue as principal. While this sentiment reflects the high regard in which he is held, such a request is ultimately unfair to him. This promotion is a recognition of his hard work and career progression. Asking him to remain at the school denies him a deserved opportunity and places an undue burden on him to compensate for the Ministry’s flawed planning.

The real issue here is not Mr. Waththuhewa’s promotion but the lack of foresight and strategic planning by the Secretary of Education and other top officials. Appointing a principal whose promotion was imminent only underscores the Ministry’s failure to anticipate and address leadership transitions effectively.

Frequent leadership changes: A systemic problem

Royal College has seen a troubling pattern of frequent principal changes in recent years, disrupting its stability and long-term planning.

1. The 8-month tenure principal:

One of Mr. Waththuhewa’s predecessors was appointed just eight months before his mandatory retirement. Despite his commendable efforts during this time, his appointment reflects the Ministry’s lack of strategic planning. How can a principal, with such a limited tenure, deliver sustainable results?

2. Mr. Waththuhewa’s promotion:

His appointment to Royal College came when his promotion within the Ministry was already foreseeable. The question arises: Were the Secretary and senior officials unaware of this impending promotion, or did they simply not consider its implications for the school?

A planned decline in excellence?

There is growing speculation among stakeholders that the leadership instability and deteriorating systems at Royal College are not merely the result of poor planning but part of a deliberate agenda to weaken the institution.

1. Undermining the school’s legacy:

As Sri Lanka’s flagship school, Royal College has long been a symbol of excellence. Some believe the lack of stable leadership and consistent oversight is a calculated move to erode this legacy and diminish the school’s influence.

2. Politicisation of appointments:

The prestigious position of principal at Royal College appears to be treated as a career milestone or political reward rather than a role demanding long-term dedication.

3. Neglect by the Ministry:

The Secretary of Education and other top officials have repeatedly failed to prioritise the strategic needs of the school. Their decisions have led to frequent disruptions, weakening Royal College’s ability to function effectively.

Who bears the responsibility?

The current leadership crisis at Royal College is not the fault of the outgoing principal but of the Ministry of Education’s top officials, including the Secretary. Their inability to foresee career transitions, such as retirements or promotions, has resulted in short-term appointments that leave the school in limbo.

This failure to implement a strategic approach has led to:

A lack of continuity in leadership.

Disruption to ongoing initiatives and long-term plans.

A decline in the school’s overall functionality and morale.

To prevent further damage to Royal College and other premier institutions, the Ministry of Education must take immediate steps to address these systemic issues.

1. Long-term strategic planning:

Principals must be appointed with a minimum tenure of five years, ensuring stability and the ability to implement sustainable initiatives.

2. Transparent appointment processes:

Leadership appointments should be based on merit, with careful consideration of candidates’ career timelines to avoid abrupt transitions.

3. Accountability for top officials:

The Secretary of Education and senior officials must take responsibility for the mismanagement of appointments and ensure that future decisions align with the institution’s long-term interests.

While it is understandable that stakeholders are disheartened by Mr. Waththuhewa’s departure, asking him to remain at the school is both unfair to him and ineffective in addressing the root problem. The real issue lies with the Ministry’s failure to ensure consistent, strategic leadership at Royal College.

If these systemic issues are not resolved, Royal College risks further decline, not because of its principals but because of the inability—or unwillingness—of those at the top to prioritise the school’s legacy and success. It is time for stakeholders to demand accountability and reform, ensuring that Sri Lanka’s premier educational institution receives the leadership it deserves.
