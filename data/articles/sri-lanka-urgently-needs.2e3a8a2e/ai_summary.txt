Sri Lanka is aiming to achieve 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050. As of March 2024, only 1093 MW of the country's power generation capacity of 5,012 MW came from renewable energy sources, excluding hydro. To meet its renewable energy goals, Sri Lanka needs to add around 7,000 MW of renewable energy in the next 25 years, primarily via large-scale wind and solar projects. The country has a potential capacity of 16 GW solar power and 92 GW offshore wind power. Most additional capacity will have to come from the private sector. Indian company Adani Group has proposed to invest $740m to generate 484 MW of wind power in Sri Lanka. The project could save the country $270m annually and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, as well as meet the energy demands of around 0.6 million households. If successful, the project could be a model for achieving Sri Lanka's energy self-sufficiency targets.
