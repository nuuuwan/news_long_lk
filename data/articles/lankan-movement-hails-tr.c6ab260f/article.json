    "MMSL urges the American President to stop international funding agencies from insisting that LGBTQIA++ Woke values should be adhered to",
    "A protester holding a placard demanding her rights at a LGBTIQ protest march held in Colombo. File photo",
    "On Tuesday, the Mothers\u2019 Movement of Sri Lanka (MMSL) will submit to the US embassy here, a petition addressed to President-elect Donald Trump, urging him to keep up his fight against LGBTQIA++ Woke values and help restore traditional social and familial values in America, Sri Lanka, and the world at large.",
    "\u201cLGBTQIA++\u201d is an acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual. The \u201c++\u201d represents other identities that are not included in the acronym.",
    "\u201cWoke\u201d or \u201cwokeism\u201d is an American term that describes attitudes and actions of people who oppose discrimination and injustice done on grounds of ethnicity, race, class, gender or place of origin. With the rise of the political right in the US, wokeism has come to represent \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and an exaggerated sensitivity about ethnicity, race, class, gender or place of origin. In right wing circles it has acquired a pejorative connotation.",
    "The term \u201cwokeism\u201d is derived from the term \u201cwoke\u201d which is Black American lingo for being \u201cawake\u201d or \u201cawakened\u201d. In America of the 1930s, \u201cwoke\u201d meant \u201cbeing aware of one\u2019s surroundings\u201d in order to avoid provoking the White surrounding. Later, it meant \u201cspeaking and acting against racial injustices\u201d, as in the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement.",
    "Still later, wokeism began to be used by social and political right wingers to refer to \u201crestrictive political correctness\u201d. Many right wingers considered wokeism an unnecessary and painful constraint artificially imposed on people who liked to follow traditional forms of expression even if that was not in line with existing notions of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d",
    "Much of the opposition to wokeism was fuelled by a political backlash against the teaching of \u201ccritical race theory\u201d- a theory which says that racism is embedded in American society.\u00a0 This theory makes present-day Whites responsible for the discrimination and atrocities committed by their forefathers against Blacks and other non-Whites.",
    "Mothers\u2019 Movement\u2019s Plea",
    "The petition of the Mothers\u2019 Movement of Sri Lanka to Trump begins by praising him for standing up against the LGBTQIA++ Woke values, and supporting the \u201cRights of the Child, the Biological Woman and societal nucleus, the family\u201d, instead.",
    "The MMSL branded the LGBTQIA++ and Woke agenda, as a \u201csocial illness spreading across America and in Sri Lanka as well.\u201d The petition said that the LGBTQIA++ Woke agenda is against \u201ctreasured Sri Lankan traditions, religions and cultural norms. It has been forced upon our people and schools subtly and progressively by US Funding Agencies and Big Pharma Mafia.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe cannot allow this agenda to destroy our nation, as all religions practiced in Sri Lanka abhor this unethical and immoral coercion upon us,\u201d the petition added.",
    "The petition applauded Trump\u2019s stand against the LGBTQIA++ and Woke agenda \u201cwhich targets innocent children and makes them victims of brainwashing and invasive surgeries, resulting in life-long medications.\u201d",
    "\u201cSuch modern trends have destroyed and castrated countless innocent children and adversely affected many families,\u201d the petition said.",
    "Indeed, following his first inauguration in January 2017, Trump had unleashed a sustained campaign to erase protections for LGBTQ people across the entire US federal government.",
    "According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), these measures included an all-of-government effort to \u201cpush transgender out of existence\u201d by eroding protections for transgender students and workers, and weakening access to gender-affirming health care.",
    "The successor Biden administration reversed many of those policies but Trump promised to go even further if re-elected to the White House. Based on his own campaign promises, and the detailed policy proposals of his \u201cProject 2025\u201d, Trump is expected to pursue his pet agenda vigorously.",
    "The MMSL\u2019s petition charged that the LGBTQIA and Woke agenda is being \u201cunethically\u201d forced on Sri Lankans, who are currently economically vulnerable, making these attitudinal changes a \u201cpre-condition for US-IMF and World Bank handouts.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur appeal (to you) is to remove this condition, enforced upon us by the IMF, World Bank and USAID, for the approval of financial aid, assistance, grants or loans,\u201d MMSL said. Going further it said that \u201cUS taxpayer\u2019s hard-earned money is being unethically used to fund LGBTQIA++/Woke programmes across Sri Lanka. The affected are children, teens, journalists, lawyers, medical professionals, law enforcement authorities, educationists and academics via US-funded NGOs.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis immoral unethical propagation and perpetuation of evil must be stopped. Please be kind enough to issue instructions to immediately end such funding that promotes the implementation of LGBTQIA++/Woke initiatives. Funding and supporting such immoral initiatives brings disrepute and discredit to your acclaimed Great Nation. We want our people to see America as a strong ethical partner in progress and security.\u201d",
    "Trump\u2019s vision for education has revolved around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d In the past, Trump had wanted to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and \u201cstructural\u201d racism. He wanted to abolish diversity and inclusion offices and to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports. Trump had depicted schools as a political battleground against leftists, liberals, and those who support wokeism.",
    "Florida\u2019s Republican Governor, Ron DeSantis, had said that he would\u00a0 fight wokes in the legislature, in education and in businesses and will\u00a0 never, ever, surrender to the woke mob. \u201cOur State is where woke goes to die,\u201d DeSantis declared.",
    "Wokeism has come to represent \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and an exaggerated sensitivity about ethnicity, race, class, gender or place of origin",
    "In 2022, he proposed State legislation to bar schools and workplaces from teaching that individuals are \u201cinherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\u201d His office characterized this as \u201ca legislative proposal that will give businesses, employees, children and families tools to fight back against woke indoctrination. The Stop W.O.K.E. Act will be the strongest legislation of its kind in the nation and will take on both corporate wokeness and Critical Race Theory.\u201d",
    "In August 2022, the \u201cStop Woke Act\u201d led to an injunction from US District Court Judge Mark E. Walker. It blocked the enforcement of the law against businesses. Walker said that the statute was an impermissible limit on the businesses\u2019 speech and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US constitution",
    "In March 2024, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Walker\u2019s injunction, with Judge Britt Grant describing the legislation as the \u201clatest attempt to control speech by re-characterizing it as conduct.\u201d The court also said that the law was too vague to be enforced and that it was unconstitutional because it targeted ideas. He further said that it penalized certain viewpoints, \u201cthe greatest First Amendment sin.\u201d",
    "Activists, politicians and judges have spoken. But what about ordinary Americans? According to a PEW Research Centre Survey, Americans hold a complex set of views on these issues, though broad patterns do emerge.",
    "60% say that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. This is up from 56% in 2021 and 54% in 2017. It means that the majority in America disapproves sex-reassignment surgery.",
    "When it comes to issues surrounding gender identity, young adults are at the leading edge of change and acceptance. 50% of adults from ages 18 to 29 say that a person can be a man or a woman even if that differed from the sex they were assigned at birth. 40% of those between 30 to 49 and about 30% of those 50 and older agree with that view. This means that the young are more radical on this issue than older persons.",
    "These views differ even more sharply, going by political affiliations. Democratic party supporters hold more liberal views as compared to Republican-leaners (61% to 13%). 58% favour proposals that will require transgender athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth.",
    "The public is more evenly split when it comes to making it illegal for public schools to teach gender identity in elementary schools (41% favour and 38% oppose). On investigating parents for \u201cchild abuse\u201d if they help someone younger than 18 get medical care for a gender transition, 37% are in favour and 36% are not. As one sees, there is evenness on this issue."
