Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka

On the occasion of the upcoming Year of the Horse, I am delighted to gather with you all to ring out the old and usher in the new. On behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, I would like to extend festive greetings to all the overseas Chinese, staff of Chinese companies and Chinese students in Sri Lanka. I also wish to express sincere appreciation to friends from all walks of life who have consistently cared for and supported the growth of China-Sri Lanka relations.

Among all festivals, the Spring Festival holds the highest place. Among all seasons, spring stands as the first. As the most ancient, grand and important traditional festival in China, the Spring Festival represents the cultural roots and emotional bonds of the Chinese people, embodies their devotion to family and country, and conveys the values of peace, goodwill and harmony. Although originating in China, the Spring Festival now belongs to the world. Having been inscribed on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, its global influence continues to grow. The Spring Festival is increasingly becoming a window to showcase Chinese culture and a bridge for cultural exchange and mutual learning among civilisations.

Extraordinary chapter on the journey toward building a great country

At the juncture of history, there is always a scene of majestic variety. The year 2025 marks the completion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the formulation of the 15th Five-Year Plan, holding significant importance in the pursuit of Chinese modernisation. In the face of a complicated international landscape and the challenging domestic tasks of advancing  reform, promoting development and ensuring stability, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united the entire party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and led them in overcoming difficulties head-on and forging ahead with determination. Our endeavours have etched an extraordinary chapter on the journey toward building a great country and advancing national rejuvenation.

Over the past year, China, like a colossal ship, has navigated through the waves and sailed steadily forward. China’s performance is impressive. The momentum for stability in our economy has been reinforced, the stride of progress has grown more vigorous, new driving forces of growth have been fostered and expanded, and the resilience of the economy has become more prominent. China’s GDP has exceeded 140 trillion yuan (USD 20 trillion) for the first time. Major breakthroughs and significant advances have been achieved in cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum technology. The Tianwen-2 probe has embarked on its journey to explore outer space. China’s first aircraft carrier equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system was officially commissioned. The “Chinese artificial sun” has set a new world record. The light of scientific and technological innovation has illuminated the way for our journey forward. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee was convened to chart a grand blueprint for continuously advancing Chinese modernisation. We solemnly commemorated the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, demonstrating national grandeur and military prowess, and pooling the strength to forge ahead.

Firmly on the right course

Over the past year, amidst a fast-changing international landscape, China has stayed firmly on the right course and upheld its responsibility. Profound changes not seen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace, the changes are intertwined with disturbances. Nevertheless, China has consistently been a force for peace, stability and progress in the world. The banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind has illuminated the way forward, and the four global initiatives have provided a framework for action to tackle global challenges. Both head-of-state and host-country diplomacy have achieved fruitful results. China’s efforts for peace and dialogue have contributed to easing hotspot issues. All this has delivered valuable stability and positive energy to the world. As a major engine of global growth, China has continued to embrace the world with high-standard opening up. The total volume of goods import and export have topped 45 trillion yuan. The circle of friends in the Belt and Road cooperation continues to expand. Platforms such as the China International Import Expo, the China International Fair for Trade in Services and others have provided opportunities for all countries to share China’s development. With our strong impetus to the global economy, China has written a splendid chapter of forging ahead in step with the world and pursuing shared prosperity for all.

China-Sri Lanka relations

Over the past year, China-Sri Lanka relations have carried forward past achievements and entered a new phase of development. President Xi Jinping and other leaders met with President Dissanayake and Prime Minister Amarasuriya during their visits to China, reaching important consensus and fruitful outcomes of cooperation. These interactions have provided new strategic guidance for the growth of bilateral relations. The two sides have maintained close exchanges at all levels. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation has delivered fruitful results. Exchanges and cooperation in areas such as port economy, modern agriculture, digital economy, culture and tourism have remained vibrant. The Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port are thriving as key coastal hubs, injecting new vitality into Sri Lanka, “the Pearl of the Indian Ocean”. Bridges of friendship between our peoples have crossed mountains and seas and grown ever wider. Chinese martial arts, tea culture and films have won the hearts of the Sri Lankan people. In the aftermath of the Cyclone Ditwah, China provided prompt financial assistance and large quantities of supplies. China has donated school uniform materials for four consecutive years and supported the implementation of numerous livelihood projects across Sri Lanka. Our two peoples have thus grown closer, hand in hand and heart to heart.

Over the past year, our compatriots in Sri Lanka have worked hard in unity to realise shared dreams. The robust progress in China-Sri Lanka relations is inseparable from the dedicated efforts of our compatriots. Chinese companies have overcome difficulties and shouldered significant responsibilities, contributing to bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Chinese teachers and students have promoted Chinese culture and told China’s stories well. Overseas Chinese have remained deeply connected to their roots, giving back to their homeland with sincerity and action. Everyone present here has played an important role in deepening exchanges and cooperation and enhancing the friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka has also actively implemented the vision of “people-centred diplomacy”, continuously improved the quality and efficiency of consular services, and made every effort to address the concerns of our compatriots. With dedication and compassion, we have worked to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese institutions and citizens in Sri Lanka.

2026 marks the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan

The dream is lofty, the journey long—bold strides will get us there. The year 2026 marks the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan. China is advancing with high spirits toward the Second Centenary Goal of building a great modern socialist country in all respects. Guided by the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, the Chinese Embassy will set sail with full vigour, spur ahead like a galloping steed, and spare no effort in advancing all-round practical cooperation between China and Sri Lanka. We will contribute to building a China-Sri Lanka community with a shared future and foster a favourable environment for our compatriots to pursue their endeavours in Sri Lanka. We will always uphold our diplomatic mission to serve the people, keep the well-being and safety of our compatriots close to heart, and work steadfastly to address practical matters, deliver tangible benefits and resolve difficulties—standing as your strong pillar of support. In the new year, we hope all compatriots will unite in purpose, support one another, uphold the positive image of Chinese people overseas and continue to serve as promoters of China-Sri Lanka cooperation, communicators of Chinese culture, and builders of people-to-people friendship.

As the Golden Snake bids farewell to the old year, the Steed heralds a new spring. In Chinese culture, the horse symbolises perseverance, vitality and an indomitable spirit. Let us invigorate the pioneering spirit, muster our determination and drive, and turn our great vision into a splendid reality. In closing,

May our great motherland prosper and thrive, enjoying peace and tranquillity.

May the friendship between China and Sri Lanka endure and flourish through the ages.

May you all enjoy good health, smooth endeavours, family happiness and auspicious blessings in the Year of the Horse.
