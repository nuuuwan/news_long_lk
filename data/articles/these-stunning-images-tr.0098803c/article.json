    "As we run, drive, bike, and fly, we leave behind telltale marks of our movements on Earth\u2014if you know where to look. Physical tracks, thermal signatures, and chemical traces can reveal where we\u2019ve been. But another type of trail we leave comes from the radio signals emitted by the cars, planes, trains, and boats we use.

    "On airplanes, technology called ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast) provides real-time location, identification, speed, and orientation data. For ships at sea, that function is performed by the AIS (Automatic Identification System).  Operating at 161.975 and 162.025 megahertz, AIS transmitters broadcast a ship\u2019s identification number, name, call sign, length and beam, type, and antenna location every six minutes. Ship location, position time stamp, and direction are transmitted more frequently. The primary purpose of AIS is maritime safety\u2014it helps prevent collisions, assists in rescues, and provides insight into the impact of ship traffic on marine life. US Coast Guard regulations say that generally, private boats under 65 feet in length are not required to use AIS, but most commercial vessels are. Unlike ADS-B in planes, AIS can be turned off only in rare circumstances.\u00a0 A variety of sectors use AIS data for many different applications, including monitoring ship traffic to avoid disruption of undersea internet cables, identifying whale strikes, and studying the footprint of underwater noise. Advertisement Using the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association\u2019s Marine Cadastre tool, you can download 16 years of detailed daily ship movements, as well as \u201ctransit count\u201d maps generated from a year\u2019s worth of data showing each ship\u2019s accumulated paths. The data is collected entirely from ground-based stations along the US coasts. I downloaded all of 2023\u2019s transit count maps and loaded them up in geographic information system software called QGIS to visualize this year of marine traffic.",
    "The maps are abstract and electric. With landmasses removed, the ship traces resemble long-exposure photos of sparklers, high-energy particle collisions, or strands of fiber-optic wire.

Some of these are fishing grounds, others are scientific surveys mapping the seafloor, and others represent boats going to and from offshore oil rigs, especially off Louisiana\u2019s gulf coast.",
    "Hiding in plain sight Having a global, near-real-time system for tracking the precise movements of all ships at sea sounds like a great innovation\u2014unless you\u2019re trying to keep your ships\u2019 movements and cargoes secret.

    "In 2023, Bloomberg investigated how Russia evaded sanctions on its oil exports after the invasion of Ukraine by \u201cspoofing\u201d\u2014transmitting fake AIS data\u2014to mislead observers. Tracking a fleet of rusting ships of questionable seaworthiness, reporters compared AIS data with what they actually saw on the sea\u2014and discovered that the ships weren\u2019t where the data said they were.\u00a0 Monitoring the fishing industry Clusters of fishing vessels gravitating toward known fishing grounds create some of the most interesting patterns on the maps.\u00a0 Global Fishing Watch is an international nonprofit that uses AIS to monitor the fishing industry, seeking to protect marine life from overfishing. But it says that only 2% of fishing vessels use AIS transmitters.\u00a0 The organization, which is backed by Google, the ocean conservation group Oceana, and the satellite imagery company SkyTruth, combines AIS data with satellite imagery and uses machine learning to classify the types of fishing technology being used.\u00a0 In a press release announcing the creation of Global Fishing Watch, John Amos, the president and founder of SkyTruth, said: \u201cSo much of what happens out on the high seas is invisible, and that has been a huge barrier to understanding and showing the world what\u2019s at stake for the ocean.\u201d\u00a0 A version of this story appeared in Beautiful Public Data (beautifulpublicdata.com), a newsletter that curates visually interesting datasets collected by government agencies."
