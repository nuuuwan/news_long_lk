Speaking up — and being heard — in organizations is critical, but failed attempts to speak up happen often at work and can lead people to silence themselves and others in the long run. Instead, leaders and team members should frame such situations as opportunities to learn. But this isn’t easy; it can be difficult to recognize such moments as learning opportunities; it can be difficult to move beyond counterproductive emotions like shame and blame,;and we tend to be too busy and focused on the short term to learn. The authors’ research and experience have shown that the antidote starts with all team members, including the leader, explicitly framing such interactions as experiments from which everyone expects to learn; preparing for them; paying attention to them; implementing certain process tools; and thinking more long-term about learning.

Elena, a new member of a manufacturing operations team, has identified possible safety improvements. She’s thought about what she wants to say to the team but is nervous about speaking up. Why? She’s wary of her new boss, Raya; she doesn’t want to get off on the wrong foot with her colleagues; and she isn’t absolutely sure her ideas will work across the multiple plants that the team oversees.
