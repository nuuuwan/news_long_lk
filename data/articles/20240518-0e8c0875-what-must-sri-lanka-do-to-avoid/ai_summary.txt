The article discusses the dire potential consequences of a second default by Sri Lanka on its external debt. It highlights that countries with a history of defaulting are prone to default again within a decade. If Sri Lanka were to default again, the impact could be more severe than the first default in 2022. The IMF, bilateral creditors, and bondholders are expected to impose stricter conditions, further squeezing the country's financial stability. With a significant portion of the population already impoverished from the first default, a second would exacerbate the economic strain, potentially leading to the firesale of state-owned enterprises.

To avoid a second default, the article suggests:
1. **Negotiating Favourable Debt Restructuring:** Seeking greater debt relief from creditors, particularly the ISB bondholders, and emphasizing the need for a larger "haircut."
2. **Improving Credit Ratings:** Enhancing GDP growth, better debt management, fiscal and monetary policies, and political stability to lower borrowing costs.
3. **Promoting Economic Growth:** Expanding the economy through tradable sectors, creating free trade agreements, improving ease of doing business, and investing in education, particularly in STEM fields.
4. **Greater Economic Partnership with India:** Capitalizing on India's economic growth, particularly with Tamil Nadu, to drive long-term economic growth and attract investments.

The article concludes that Sri Lanka must engage in long-term planning and political consensus to prevent another default, ensuring debt restructuring, lowering borrowing costs, and fostering economic integration and growth.
