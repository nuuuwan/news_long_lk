    "Imagine this: You\u2019ve been feeling unwell, so you call up your doctor\u2019s office to make an appointment. To your surprise, they schedule you in for the next day. At the appointment, you aren\u2019t rushed through describing your health concerns; instead, you have a full half hour to share your symptoms and worries and the exhaustive details of your health history with someone who listens attentively and asks thoughtful follow-up questions. You leave with a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and the sense that, for once, you\u2019ve been able to discuss your health with the care that it merits. Related StoryAI companies have stopped warning you that their chatbots aren\u2019t doctorsOnce cautious, OpenAI, Grok, and others will now dive into giving unverified medical advice with virtually no disclaimers.",
    "The catch? You might not have spoken to a doctor, or other licensed medical practitioner, at all.  This is the new reality for patients at a small number of clinics in Southern California that are run by the medical startup Akido Labs. These patients\u2014some of whom are on Medicaid\u2014can access specialist appointments on short notice, a privilege typically only afforded to the wealthy few who patronize concierge clinics. The key difference is that Akido patients spend relatively little time, or even no time at all, with their doctors. Instead, they see a medical assistant, who can lend a sympathetic ear but has limited clinical training. The job of formulating diagnoses and concocting a treatment plan is done by a proprietary, LLM-based system called ScopeAI that transcribes and analyzes the dialogue between patient and assistant. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system\u2019s recommendations.",
    "\u201cOur focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,\u201d says Jared Goodner, Akido\u2019s CTO.\u00a0 According to Prashant Samant, Akido\u2019s CEO, this approach allows doctors to see four to five times as many patients as they could previously. There\u2019s good reason to want doctors to be much more productive. Americans are getting older and sicker, and many struggle to access adequate health care. The pending 15% reduction in federal funding for Medicaid will only make the situation worse.",
    "But experts aren\u2019t convinced that displacing so much of the cognitive work of medicine onto AI is the right way to remedy the doctor shortage. There\u2019s a big gap in expertise between doctors and AI-enhanced medical assistants, says Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley.\u00a0 Jumping such a gap may introduce risks. \u201cI am broadly excited about the potential of AI to expand access to medical expertise,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not obvious to me that this particular way is the way to do it.\u201d AI is already everywhere in medicine. Computer vision tools identify cancers during preventive scans, automated research systems allow doctors to quickly sort through the medical literature, and LLM-powered medical scribes can take appointment notes on a clinician\u2019s behalf. But these systems are designed to support doctors as they go about their typical medical routines. What distinguishes ScopeAI, Goodner says, is its ability to independently complete the cognitive tasks that constitute a medical visit, from eliciting a patient\u2019s medical history to coming up with a list of potential diagnoses to identifying the most likely diagnosis and proposing appropriate next steps. Under the hood, ScopeAI is a set of large language models, each of which can perform a specific step in the visit\u2014from generating appropriate follow-up questions based on what a patient has said to to populating a list of likely conditions. For the most part, these LLMs are fine-tuned versions of Meta\u2019s open-access Llama models, though Goodner says that the system also makes use of Anthropic\u2019s Claude models.\u00a0  During the appointment, assistants read off questions from the ScopeAI interface, and ScopeAI produces new questions as it analyzes what the patient says. For the doctors who will review its outputs later, ScopeAI produces a concise note that includes a summary of the patient\u2019s visit, the most likely diagnosis, two or three alternative diagnoses, and recommended next steps, such as referrals or prescriptions. It also lists a justification for each diagnosis and recommendation. ScopeAI is currently being used in cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care clinics and by Akido\u2019s street medicine team, which serves the Los Angeles homeless population. That team\u2014which is led by Steven Hochman, a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine\u2014meets patients out in the community to help them access medical care, including treatment for substance use disorders.\u00a0 Previously, in order to prescribe a drug to treat an opioid addiction, Hochman would have to meet the patient in person; now, caseworkers armed with ScopeAI can interview patients on their own, and Hochman can approve or reject the system\u2019s recommendations later. \u201cIt allows me to be in 10 places at once,\u201d he says. Since they started using ScopeAI, the team has been able to get patients access to medications to help treat their substance use within 24 hours\u2014something that Hochman calls \u201cunheard of.\u201d",
    "This arrangement is only possible because homeless patients typically get their health insurance from Medicaid, the public insurance system for low-income Americans. While Medicaid allows doctors to approve ScopeAI prescriptions and treatment plans asynchronously, both for street medicine and clinic visits, many other insurance providers require that doctors speak directly with patients before approving those recommendations. Pierson says that discrepancy raises concerns. \u201cYou worry about that exacerbating health disparities,\u201d she says. Samant is aware of the appearance of inequity, and he says the discrepancy isn\u2019t intentional\u2014it\u2019s just a feature of how the insurance plans currently work. He also notes that being seen quickly by an AI-enhanced medical assistant may be better than dealing with long wait times and limited provider availability, which is the status quo for Medicaid patients. And all Akido patients can opt for traditional doctor\u2019s appointments, if they are willing to wait for them, he says. Part of the challenge of deploying a tool like ScopeAI is navigating a regulatory and insurance landscape that wasn\u2019t designed for AI systems that can independently direct medical appointments. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, says that any AI system that effectively acts as a \u201cdoctor in a box\u201d would likely need to be approved by the FDA and could run afoul of medical licensure laws, which dictate that only doctors and other licensed professionals can practice medicine. The California Medical Practice Act says that AI can't replace a doctor\u2019s responsibility to diagnose and treat a patient, but doctors are allowed to use AI in their work, and they don\u2019t need to see patients in-person or in real-time before diagnosing them. Neither the FDA nor the Medical Board of California were able to say whether or not ScopeAI was on solid legal footing based only on a written description of the system.  But Samant is confident that Akido is in compliance, as ScopeAI was intentionally designed to fall short of being a \u201cdoctor in a box.\u201d Because the system requires a human doctor to review and approve of all of its diagnostic and treatment recommendations, he says, it doesn\u2019t require FDA approval.\u00a0 At the clinic, this delicate balance between AI and doctor decision making happens entirely behind the scenes. Patients don\u2019t ever see the ScopeAI interface directly\u2014instead, they speak with a medical assistant who asks questions in the way that a doctor might in a typical appointment. That arrangement might make patients feel more comfortable. But Zeke Emanuel, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who served in the Obama and Biden administrations, worries that this comfort could be obscuring from patients the extent to which an algorithm is influencing their care. Pierson agrees. \u201cThat certainly isn\u2019t really what was traditionally meant by the human touch in medicine,\u201d she says. DeAndre Siringoringo, a medical assistant who works at Akido\u2019s cardiology office in Rancho Cucamonga, says that while he tells the patients he works with that an AI system will be listening to the appointment in order to gather information for their doctor, he doesn\u2019t inform them about the specifics of how ScopeAI works, including the fact that it makes diagnostic recommendations to doctors.",
    "Because all ScopeAI recommendations are reviewed by a doctor, that might not seem like such a big deal\u2014it\u2019s the doctor who makes the final diagnosis, not the AI. But it\u2019s been widely documented that doctors using AI systems tend to go along with the system\u2019s recommendations more often than they should, a phenomenon known as automation bias.\u00a0 At this point, it\u2019s impossible to know whether automation bias is affecting doctors\u2019 decisions at Akido clinics, though Pierson says it\u2019s a risk\u2014especially when doctors aren\u2019t physically present for appointments. \u201cI worry that it might predispose you to sort of nodding along in a way that you might not if you were actually in the room watching this happen,\u201d she says.",
    "An Akido spokesperson says that automation bias is a valid concern for any AI tool that assists a doctor\u2019s decision-making and that the company has made efforts to mitigate that bias. \u201cWe designed ScopeAI specifically to reduce bias by proactively countering blind spots that can influence medical decisions, which historically lean heavily on physician intuition and personal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also train physicians explicitly on how to use ScopeAI thoughtfully, so they retain accountability and avoid over-reliance.\u201d Akido evaluates ScopeAI\u2019s performance by testing it on historical data and monitoring how often doctors correct its recommendations; those corrections are also used to further train the underlying models. Before deploying ScopeAI in a given specialty, Akido ensures that when tested on historical data sets, the system includes the correct diagnosis in its top three recommendations at least 92% of the time. But Akido hasn\u2019t undertaken more rigorous testing, such as studies that compare ScopeAI appointments with traditional in-person or telehealth appointments, in order to determine whether the system improves\u2014or at least maintains\u2014patient outcomes. Such a study could help indicate whether automation bias is a meaningful concern. \u201cMaking medical care cheaper and more accessible is a laudable goal,\u201d Pierson says. \u201cBut I just think it\u2019s important to conduct strong evaluations comparing to that baseline.\u201d  hide"
