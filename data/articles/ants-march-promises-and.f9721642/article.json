    "A year later, the Government\u2019s rhythm remains, yet its melody has dulled",
    "One year on, the moral march of Anura Kumara Disanayake\u2019s Government echoes Jonathan Chait\u2019s warning: movements that mistake conviction for wisdom risk becoming moral parades rather than governing forces [1].",
    "1. The promise of the march",
    "\u201cThe ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah\u2026 The little one stops to tie his shoe\u2026\u201d Adapted from an old folk rhyme, the song endures because its rhythm carries a warning: unity preserves survival, but unthinking motion breeds futility.",
    "When Anura Kumara Disanayake (AKD) and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) took office, their campaign sounded like that hopeful parade of ants escaping a storm. They promised to rebuild the rule of law, purge corruption, and restore national dignity. To weary citizens, the rhythm of their march felt redemptive \u2014 an orderly exit from chaos.",
    "2. The drift \u2014 motion without meaning",
    "A year later, the Government\u2019s rhythm remains, yet its melody has dulled. Discipline endures, but direction has faded.",
    "Debt and the surrender of sovereignty. AKD pledged to renegotiate the IMF program on fairer terms. Instead, the agreement was accepted almost intact, yielding roughly a 10% debt haircut while Argentina under Mart\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n achieved around 45%. The resulting austerity has placed the burden squarely on households, turning sovereignty from a principle into a slogan.",
    "Judicial appointments and rule of law. The promised cleansing of institutions soon gave way to continuity. Individuals previously linked to controversy now hold senior judicial or prosecutorial posts, and a former Chief Justice facing public criticism was later nominated to a UN position. The symbolic \u201cpause to tie the shoe\u201d \u2014 the moral moment to reflect before marching \u2014 never occurred.",
    "3. The container affair \u2014 when the march turned blind",
    "In early 2025, media reports revealed that over 300 containers left the Colombo Port without inspection. The DGC later stated that the release order followed joint advice from President Disanayake and Ports Minister Bimal Ratnayake [2]. Whether or not the cargo contained illicit goods, the breach was serious: executive direction overriding institutional autonomy \u2014 the opposite of the NPP\u2019s pledge of transparency.",
    "4. The Chait Lens \u2014 From Washington to Colombo",
    "Jonathan Chait\u2019s analysis of post-defeat paralysis in the US Democratic Party illuminates the NPP\u2019s post-victory drift [1].",
    "The cult of purity: dissent becomes disloyalty; critique becomes betrayal.",
    "Timid moderation, loud rhetoric: AKD\u2019s rhetoric is thunderous; governance is cautious.",
    "Detachment from the electorate: the NPP increasingly speaks to its own echo chamber.",
    "Moral theatre versus responsibility: governance becomes performance; virtue becomes costume.",
    "5. Lessons from the ants and the democrats",
    "Ideological rigidity: Refusal to admit error \u2014 whether over IMF negotiations or foreign dependency \u2014 turns policy into creed.",
    "Moral narcissism: Conviction in one\u2019s righteousness blinds leaders to compromise.",
    "Timidity as principle: Avoidance of confrontation is recast as prudence; genuine courage lies in persuasion and disclosure.",
    "6. Fault lines after one year",
    "Fiscal fragility: Debt service absorbs most revenue.",
    "Persistent hardship: Prices of essentials remain punishing.",
    "Foreign dependency: The rhetoric of sovereignty coexists with reliance on India and the IMF.",
    "Democratic closure: Parliamentary and institutional checks have weakened.",
    "Declining confidence: Early public enthusiasm is eroding.",
    "Each is another verse in a song that now sounds mechanical.",
    "7. Integrity and the Burkina Faso contrast",
    "At the 80th UN session, AKD presented himself as leading a crusade against corruption. Yet beside Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso \u2014 who spoke of dignity, independence, and self-sacrifice \u2014 AKD\u2019s speech sounded managerial rather than moral; calculated, not courageous.",
    "8. Selective accountability \u2014 the Ranil test",
    "AKD pledged to \u201cbring the culprits under the law.\u201d Yet his most visible action against Ranil Wickremesinghe concerns a mere Rs. 16.6 million travel-fund case, while far larger scandals remain untouched:",
    "LPG procurement (2022\u20132023): Auditor General reported losses of Rs. 1.349 billion; the reversal of the cheaper Siam Gas tender occurred under Ranil as Finance Minister [3].",
    "Central Bank Bond Issue (2015): Estimated public losses exceeded Rs. 11 billion. Arjuna Mahendran remains at large [4].",
    "Batalanda (1995\u20131998): The Commission found Ranil politically responsible for detention and torture centres. No renewed action under AKD [5]. The Shylocks of Batalanda have been crying for justice for 36 years.",
    "If accountability is the cornerstone of democratic governance, it must extend beyond Rs. 16.6 million to the Rs. 1.349 billion in LPG losses, the Rs. 11 billion Bond scandal, and the non-monetary harms at Batalanda.",
    "9. Duty-free permits (2015) \u2014 a rule of law test",
    "AKD pledged equal standards under the law. Yet the 2015\u20132016 duty-free vehicle-permit episode remains unresolved.",
    "224\u2013225 MPs received permits valued at ~$ 62,500 each, many resold for Rs. 20\u201333 million profits.",
    "Critics argue the scheme lacked statutory footing and misapplied concessions meant for income-producing activity [7].",
    "Maithripala Sirisena as President (not MP), reportedly imported a vehicle on an MP permit [7].",
    "Six JVP/NPP MPs according to Election Commission records held by this author, sold their vehicles and credited ~Rs. 30 million to party funds [6].",
    "Test of consistency: If the Government is serious, it should publish the full permit list, quantify losses, recover unlawful gains, and legislate a permanent ban in favour of a transparent pooled vehicle fleet for MPs.",
    "10. The moral of the march",
    "Unity without thought becomes obedience. Order without reflection breeds decay. The \u201clittle one\u201d who stops to tie his shoe symbolises conscience in action \u2014 a pause that preserves direction. If rulers will not pause, citizens eventually will.",
    "11. Conclusion \u2014 from parade to governance",
    "After one year, the challenge is not rhythm but purpose. To restore the rule of law, symbolic prosecutions will not suffice. Genuine reform requires equal standards across the largest wounds: Batalanda, the Bond scandal, LPG procurement, and duty-free permits.",
    "Publish and prosecute \u2014 release complete files with timelines.",
    "Recover and remedy \u2014 quantify losses and initiate recovery.",
    "Legislate fairness \u2014 abolish discretionary privileges; ensure transparent asset disclosures and parliamentary oversight.",
    "These are not partisan demands but constitutional ones. Only by embodying the restraint it asks of citizens can the administration reclaim moral authority \u2014 and help Sri Lanka recover the republic it was promised.",
