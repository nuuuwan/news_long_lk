    "Our baseline forecast assumes a 20-percentage-point increase in the effective tariff rate on Chinese exports to the US, reducing China\u2019s GDP by about 0.6 percentage points from 2025 to 2027. Second-order effects on manufacturing investment and domestic consumer sentiment will further dampen economic growth.If Donald Trump enforces a 60% tariff threat on China, the total impact on GDP growth could be a loss of 2.5 percentage points over 2025-27. The revocation of China\u2019s preferential trade status would signal a significant deterioration in bilateral relations.China is likely to respond with moderate and targeted tariff retaliation, while relying primarily on non-tariff measures. The probability of a trade deal focused on trade reduction is low.Mr\u00a0Trump, the incoming US\u00a0president, is set to impose additional tariffs on goods imported from China after he takes office in January\u00a02025. This will pose a\u00a0major external challenge\u00a0to China\u2019s economy in 2025-26.\u00a0In this analysis, EIU will assess the macroeconomic impact of these tariffs and how the Chinese government will respond.We devise three\u00a0tariff scenarios in our analysis, reflecting the unpredictability of Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s policies. Our assessment is partly based on the US-China trade war under Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s first presidency, which brought the\u00a0US\u2019s weighted average tariff rate (WATR) against imported Chinese products from less than\u00a03% in 2017 to 10.3% in\u00a02023. We have also incorporated the changes in circumstances since the late\u00a02010s, including China\u2019s lower exposure to US\u00a0tariffs as a result of falling direct bilateral trade (China\u2019s share of US\u00a0direct imports has, as a result, fallen from\u00a021.9% in 2017 to\u00a013.8% in\u00a02023); \u201cconnector\u201d countries interposing themselves between the\u00a0US and China; and potential US\u00a0tariffs against other economies that would complicate business efforts to readjust their supply\u00a0chains.How will US tariffs affect China\u2019s economy?US tariffs will affect the Chinese economy directly through exports, besides second-order effects on manufacturing investment and domestic consumer sentiment.\u00a0To what extent US imports respond to tariff rate changes (such as elasticity) is crucial in determining the effect on trade volume. Elasticity denotes how much consumers and firms substitute from Chinese to other countries\u2019 goods when tariffs increase; the higher the elasticity, the greater the sensitivity to tariffs on Chinese goods.\u00a0Trade is initially inelastic, as importers struggle to find substitutes, but elasticity increases over time.\u00a0Academic studies provide a wide range of estimates for trade elasticity. A 2024\u00a0study (Haberkorn et al) on US tariff increases against China in 2018-19 showed that trade elasticity of tariffs was just over 1, one year after tariff imposition. But by 2022 it rose to\u00a04, meaning that a 1-percentage-point tariff increase corresponds to a 4-percentage-point drop in trade value of the goods concerned. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that the tariff elasticity of US\u00a0imports from China is\u00a01 within one\u00a0year of tariff\u00a0imposition.Our analysis is based on effective WATR as a key input for assessing trade shocks.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump could threaten or even impose high statutory tariffs, but the actual burden facing businesses tends to be lower owing to business lobbying, exemptions and trade substitution. This was evident in Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s first\u00a0term (Trump\u00a01.0)\u2014although statutory US\u00a0WATR against Chinese goods was\u00a019.3%, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, we estimate that the effective WATR was only\u00a010.3% as at\u00a02023.In the baseline scenario, we assume that the US will raise its effective WATR against Chinese goods by a total of 20\u00a0percentage points over 2025-27. We expect the effective tariff rate on China to rise by 5-10\u00a0percentage\u00a0points in 2025, owing to the imposition of tariffs related to\u00a0fentanyl smuggling disputes. Mr\u00a0Trump will further phase in tariffs from late\u00a02025 with a wider range of excuses and policy tools, eventually bringing the effective WATR facing Chinese exports to about\u00a030% by 2027. We expect the following\u00a0impact:We anticipate a 20% reduction in China\u2019s exports to the US\u00a0over 2025-27,\u00a0assuming elasticity at\u00a01, with the majority of the impact being felt in\u00a02026.\u00a0Chinese exports will show some resilience in 2025 owing to trade front-loading, the initial inelasticity of trade and the gradual nature of tariff\u00a0imposition.",
    "The contraction in China\u2019s exports to the US by itself will reduce GDP growth by 0.6\u00a0percentage points over\u00a02025-27, with the majority of the impact being felt in 2026-27.\u00a0The drag on the economy in 2025 comes more from the shock to private investment and consumption, reflecting dampened sentiment. As trade substitution accelerates, the effects will become more pronounced, dampening GDP growth further over\u00a02028-29.",
    "The impact will be partially absorbed by the renminbi\u2019s depreciation, but the currency will not be devalued excessively, owing to the heightened priority of currency stability. The renminbi will become more volatile and depreciate to Rmb7.45:US$1 by end-2026. Policymakers will intervene at critical exchange-rate levels to prevent a depreciatory\u00a0spiral.",
    "China will implement stimulus from early 2025, focused on greater levels of fiscal expansion and monetary loosening.\u00a0The total size of the stimulus package will amount to Rmb4.1trn per\u00a0year, or 3.2% of nominal\u00a0GDP in 2023\u00a0(measured by aggregating additional spending implied by the incremental budget deficit over\u00a03%, the increase in local government special bond quota and the expected size of special sovereign bond\u00a0issuance).",
    "Real GDP growth will slow by\u00a04.6% in 2025, 4.3% in 2026, and 4.1% in\u00a02027, as stimulus partially mitigates the tariff\u00a0shocks.Upside scenario (15% probability): not so much a shockThe upside scenario assumes that effective WATR will rise by a total of 10\u00a0percentage\u00a0points over 2025-27, similar to the increase experienced during\u00a0Trump\u00a01.0.\u00a0The fentanyl-related tariffs will not be fully imposed, and Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s other tariff threats against China will be diluted by constructive bilateral negotiations, effective business lobbying and domestic inflation concerns. The economic impact on China will be therefore limited:Direct US imports from China will be reduced by 10\u00a0percentage\u00a0points over 2025-27.\u00a0The drag on GDP will be around 0.3\u00a0percentage\u00a0points over the same period. The impact of tariffs on China\u2019s economy will be largely offset by supply-chain shifts, domestic policy responses and Chinese exporters/US importers absorbing the extra\u00a0costs.",
    "The renminbi will depreciate following tariff announcements, but receive support from the stimulus. Despite bouts of volatility, the exchange rate will end at Rmb7.25-7.35:US$1 by\u00a0end-2026.",
    "We anticipate a milder fiscal package compared to the baseline scenario, at Rmb2.9trn\u00a0per\u00a0year, or equivalent to 2.3% of nominal GDP in\u00a02023.",
    "Real GDP growth will remain strong at 4.8% in\u00a02025 owing to policy support and export front-loading.\u00a0It will slow to\u00a04.5% in 2026, as tariffs introduced in late\u00a02025 start to weigh on the\u00a0economy.Downside scenario (25% probability): growth will be nearly halved without Chinese stimulusIn this scenario, we anticipate Mr Trump threatening a blanket tariff increase of up to 60%, which would ultimately lead to an effective WATR increase of 40 percentage points, after carve-outs.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump will not only impose fentanyl-related tariffs in full in early\u00a02025, but also translate his other threats into actual, phased tariffs later on. China\u2019s permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status, which provides the legal basis for the country to conduct free\u00a0trade with the US, could be revoked. Tariffs on goods which the\u00a0US relies on import from China will be partially exempted, subject to business request, but\u00a0effective WATR will end up at\u00a050%. The economic impact on China will therefore be profound, and will not be nearly offset by policy response from the Chinese\u00a0government:Direct US imports from China will decline by about 40\u00a0percentage\u00a0points within one\u00a0year after tariffs are raised by 40\u00a0percentage points (most likely in\u00a02026), reducing total Chinese exports by around\u00a06% in the first year of tariff imposition or around\u00a010% annual average within\u00a0 the three\u00a0years after the tariff imposition, assuming a higher substitution effect from the second\u00a0year and the corresponding compounded\u00a0impact.",
    "The aggregate shock to real GDP growth over 2025-27 will be 2.5\u00a0percentage points, with 1.5\u00a0percentage points from the trade shock, and 1\u00a0percentage\u00a0point from second-order impact on investment and consumption) if China does not stimulate its\u00a0economy.",
    "The renminbi will come under significant depreciatory pressures, temporarily reaching Rmb8:US$1 upon tariff announcements or PNTR\u00a0revocation, but will settle at Rmb7.7-7.8:US$1 through forceful government intervention. We do not expect China to depreciate its currency aggressively to boost exports, but instead pursue a managed\u00a0devaluation.",
    "China will escalate its fiscal stimulus to Rmb6.9trn per year, or 5.5% of its nominal GDP in\u00a02023.\u00a0Monetary policy will become more accommodative, with a cumulative 60-basis-point reduction in the policy interest rate and a 200-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio\u00a0(RRR) over\u00a02025-27.",
    "We would then expect China\u2019s real GDP growth to decelerate to\u00a04% in 2025 and 3.5% in\u00a02026, before picking up modestly to 3.6% in\u00a02027.Chinese responses: non-tariff measures will be keyChina will feel compelled to hit back, but its tariff retaliation will be more restrained compared to a tit-for-tat approach during Trump\u00a01.0.\u00a0The country\u2019s large trade surplus with the US limits its ability to levy tariffs reciprocally. China\u2019s caution also derives from the perception that Chinese tariffs on US goods are detrimental to its own economy. That mindset is evident in its muted response to recent US\u00a0tariffs on China\u2019s electric-vehicle exports; China refrained from imposing tit-for-tat tariffs and instead just launched an anti-dumping investigation that is much more limited in\u00a0scale.We believe that China will target its tariffs at US agricultural and energy commodities with a 10%\u00a0tariff increase on both product types, while sparing most other goods. China is well-positioned given its strategic diversification of its commodity imports; for example, it increasingly substitutes Brazil soybeans for US ones. Any increase in Chinese tariffs will be defensive, contingent on how the Trump administration moves forward with its tariff\u00a0plans.China will probably focus on non-tariff measures to inflict damage on the\u00a0US.\u00a0The policy space for such measures is broader, as China is a significant market for US businesses in many industries. Potential Chinese actions\u00a0include:Fast-tracking substitution for US products in areas including civil aviation and\u00a0software;",
    "expanding export controls against the US to more strategic goods, such as rare-earth metals and\u00a0graphites; and",
    "targeting US firms that openly side with the US government in the dispute, including investigations and discriminatory treatment in public procurement or launching antitrust and anti-dumping investigations on US\u00a0firms.\u00a0Bilateral negotiations will resume, but the probability of China and the US reaching significant deals\u2014where, for example, China accepts US\u00a0demands in exchange for tariff removal\u2014is low.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump will continue to use tariff threats to bring China to the negotiating table, but deep disagreements in several areas will hinder meaningful progress. Renegotiating the US-China phase-one trade deal, which was poorly executed by both sides, also lacks appeal to politicians and the public. US\u00a0export controls on China, particularly in advanced chips and manufacturing machinery, along with China\u2019s own preoccupation with supply-chain security, will further narrow the potential for\u00a0a\u00a0deal.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
