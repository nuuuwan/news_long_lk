Sri Lanka has rejected a report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 'enforced disappearances' in the country, arguing it lacks the mandate to issue such a report. However, the Foreign Ministry appears to have overlooked important resolutions that assign the High Commissioner the role of voicing concerns about severe human rights violations. The High Commissioner selected enforced disappearances due to the large number of alleged incidents in Sri Lanka that are yet to be accounted for. The report goes back to 1971, covering the period following Sri Lanka's independence and the country's first reports of enforced disappearances. The authors of the report believe enforced disappearances are a characteristic feature of Sri Lanka's alleged culture of impunity regarding human rights abuses.
