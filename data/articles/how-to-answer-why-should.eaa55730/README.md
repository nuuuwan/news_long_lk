How do you tell a potential employer that you’re right for the job they are interviewing you for? If you make it all about yourself, you might come across too self-absorbed or boastful. If you make it all about the company, they don’t get a chance to learn why you might be the right fit. In this article, the author outlines clear steps for how to tell an interviewer why you’re the best candidate for this position and why they should hire you, along with sample language to use as a guide.

At first glance, the popular interview question “Why should we hire you?” sounds similar to “Why do you want to work here?” but the shift in perspective requires a shift in your response because instead of starting with your hopes and expectations, you’re leading with theirs. In other words, this isn’t about what benefits you so much as what benefits them.
