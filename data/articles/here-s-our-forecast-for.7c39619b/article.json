    "This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here. In December, our small but mighty AI reporting team was asked by our editors to make a prediction: What\u2019s coming next for AI?\u00a0  In 2024, AI contributed both to Nobel Prize\u2013winning chemistry breakthroughs and a mountain of cheaply made content that few people asked for but that nonetheless flooded the internet. Take AI-generated Shrimp Jesus images, among other examples. There was also a spike in greenhouse-gas emissions last year that can be attributed partly to the surge in energy-intensive AI. Our team got to thinking about how all of this will shake out in the year to come.\u00a0 As we look ahead, certain things are a given. We know that agents\u2014AI models that do more than just converse with you and can actually go off and complete tasks for you\u2014are the focus of many AI companies right now. Building them will raise lots of privacy questions about how much of our data and preferences we\u2019re willing to give up in exchange for tools that will (allegedly) save us time. Similarly, the need to make AI faster and more energy efficient is putting so-called small language models in the spotlight.",
    "We instead wanted to focus on less obvious predictions. Mine were about how AI companies that previously shunned work in defense and national security might be tempted this year by contracts from the Pentagon, and how Donald Trump\u2019s attitudes toward China could escalate the global race for the best semiconductors. Read the full list. What\u2019s not evident in that story is that the other predictions were not so clear-cut. Arguments ensued about whether or not 2025 will be the year of intimate relationships with chatbots, AI throuples, or traumatic AI breakups. To witness the fallout from our team\u2019s lively debates (and hear more about what didn\u2019t make the list), you can join our upcoming LinkedIn Live this Thursday, January 16. I\u2019ll be talking it all over with Will Douglas Heaven, our senior editor for AI, and our news editor, Charlotte Jee.",
    "Related StoryAI\u2019s emissions are about to skyrocket even furtherData center emissions have tripled since 2018. As more complex AI models like OpenAI\u2019s Sora see broad release, those figures will likely go through the roof.",
    "There are a couple other things I\u2019ll be watching closely in 2025. One is how little the major AI players\u2014namely OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google\u2014are disclosing about the environmental burden of their models. Lots of evidence suggests that asking an AI model like ChatGPT about knowable facts, like the capital of Mexico, consumes much more energy (and releases far more emissions) than simply asking a search engine. Nonetheless, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman in recent interviews has spoken positively about the idea of ChatGPT replacing the googling that we\u2019ve all learned to do in the past two decades. It\u2019s already happening, in fact.\u00a0 The environmental cost of all this will be top of mind for me in 2025, as will the possible cultural cost. We will go from searching for information by clicking links and (hopefully) evaluating sources to simply reading the responses that AI search engines serve up for us. As our editor in chief, Mat Honan, said in his piece on the subject, \u201cWho wants to have to learn when you can just know?\u201d  Now read the rest of The Algorithm Deeper Learning What\u2019s next for our privacy? The US Federal Trade Commission has taken a number of enforcement actions against data brokers, some of which have\u00a0 tracked and sold geolocation data from users at sensitive locations like churches, hospitals, and military installations without explicit consent. Though limited in nature, these actions may offer some new and improved protections for Americans\u2019 personal information.\u00a0 Why it matters: A consensus is growing that Americans need better privacy protections\u2014and that the best way to deliver them would be for Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. Enforcement actions from agencies like the FTC might be the next best thing in the meantime.
