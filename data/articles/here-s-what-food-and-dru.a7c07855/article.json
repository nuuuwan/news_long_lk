    "Earlier this week, two new leaders of the US Food and Drug Administration published a list of priorities for the agency. Both Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad are controversial figures in the science community. They were generally highly respected academics until the covid pandemic, when their contrarian opinions on masking, vaccines, and lockdowns turned many of their colleagues off them. Given all this, along with recent mass firings of FDA employees, lots of people were pretty anxious to see what this list might include\u2014and what we might expect the future of food and drug regulation in the US to look like. So let\u2019s dive into the pair\u2019s plans for new investigations, speedy approvals, and the \u201cunleashing\u201d of AI.

    "First, a bit of background. Makary, the current FDA commissioner, is a surgeon and was a professor of health policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. He\u00a0initially voiced support for stay-at-home orders during the pandemic but later changed his mind. In February 2021, he incorrectly predicted that\u00a0the US would \u201chave herd immunity by April.\u201d He has also been very critical of the FDA, writing in 2021 that\u00a0its then leadership acted like \u201ca crusty librarian\u201d and that drug approvals were \u201cerratic.\u201d Prasad, an oncologist, hematologist, and health researcher, was named director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research last month. He has long been a proponent of rigorous evidence-based medicine. When I interviewed him back in 2019, he told me that cancer drugs are often approved on the basis of weak evidence, and that they can end up being ineffective or even harmful. He has written a book arguing that drug regulators need to raise the bar of evidence for drug approvals. He was widely respected by his peers.",
    "Things changed during the pandemic. Prasad made a series of contrarian comments; he claimed that the covid virus\u00a0\u201cwas likely a lab leak\u201d despite the fact that\u00a0the vast majority of scientists believe that the virus jumped to humans from animals in a market. He\u00a0railed against Anthony Fauci, and advised readers of his blog to\u00a0\u201cbreak all home Covid tests.\u201d In 2023, he authored a post titled\u00a0\u201cDo not report Covid cases to schools & do not test yourself if you feel ill.\u201d He has even\u00a0drawn parallels between the US covid response and fascism in Nazi Germany. Suffice to say he\u2019s lost the support of many of his fellow academics. Makary and Prasad published their\u00a0\u201cpriorities for a new FDA\u201d in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday. (Funnily enough, JAMA is one of the journals that their boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., described as \u201ccorrupt\u201d just a couple of weeks ago\u2014one that\u00a0he said he\u2019d ban government scientists from publishing in. Lol.)",
    "Let\u2019s go through a few of the points the pair make in their piece. They open by declaring that the US medical system has been \u201ca 50 year failure.\u201d It\u2019s true that the US spends a lot more on health care than other wealthy countries do, and yet has a lower life expectancy. And around\u00a025 million Americans don\u2019t have health insurance. \u201cIn some ways, it is absolutely a failure,\u201d says Christopher Robertson, a professor of health law at Boston University. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s the envy of the world [because] it\u2019s very good at delivering high-end care.\u201d Either way, the reasons for failures in health care are not really the scope of the FDA, which has a focus on ensuring the safety and efficacy of food and medicines.

And that\u2019s worth the risk.",
    "Makary and Prasad then state that they want the FDA to \u201cexamine the role of ultraprocessed foods\u201d as well as additives and environmental toxins, suggesting that all these may be involved in chronic diseases. This is a favorite talking point of RFK Jr., who has made similar promises about investigating a possible connection. But this would also go beyond the current established purview of the FDA, says Robertson. There isn\u2019t a clear, agreed-upon definition of \u201cultraprocessed food,\u201d for a start, so it\u2019s hard to predict what exactly would be included in any investigation. And as things stand, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s role is primarily binary: They either allow or reject products,\u201d adds Robertson. The agency doesn\u2019t really give dietary advice.  Perhaps that could change. At his confirmation hearing, Makary\u00a0told senators he planned to evaluate school lunches, seed oils, and food dyes. \u201cMaybe three years from now the FDA will change and have much more of a food focus,\u201d says Robertson. The pair also write that they want to speed up the process of approving new drugs, which can currently take more than 10 years. Their suggestions include allowing drug developers to submit final paperwork early, while testing is still underway, and getting rid of \u201crecipes\u201d that strictly limit what manufacturers can put in infant formula. Here\u2019s where things get a little more controversial. Most new drugs fail. They might look very promising in cells in a dish, or even in animals. They might look safe enough in a small phase I study in humans. But after that, large-scale human studies reveal plenty of drugs to be either ineffective, unsafe, or both. Speeding up the drug approval process might mean some of these failures aren\u2019t noticed until a drug is already being sold and prescribed. Even preparing paperwork ahead of time might result in a huge waste of time and money for both drug developers and the FDA if that drug later fails its final round of testing, says Robertson.",
    "And as for infant formula recipes, they are in place for a reason: because we know they\u2019re safe. Loosening that requirement might allow for more innovation. It could lead to the development of better recipes. But, as Robertson points out, innovation is a double-edged sword. \u201cSome innovation saves lives; some innovation kills people,\u201d he says. Along the same lines, the pair also advocate for reducing the number of clinical trials required for the FDA to approve a drug. Instead of two \u201cpivotal\u201d clinical trials, drugmakers might only need to complete one, they suggest.

In one state, they\u2019ll allow healthy people to access unproven treatments.",
    "This is also controversial. A drug might look promising in one clinical trial and fail in another. That\u00a0was the case for aducanamab (Aduhelm), the Alzheimer\u2019s drug that\u00a0was approved by the FDA in 2021 despite the concerns of several senior officials. (Biogen, the company that developed the drug, abandoned it in 2024, and it was later withdrawn from the market.) At any rate, the FDA has already implemented several pathways for \u201cexpedited approval.\u201d The\u00a0Accelerated Approval Program fast-tracks the process for drugs that treat serious conditions or fulfill an unmet need. (Side note: This approval pathway relies on the very kind of weak evidence that Prasad has campaigned against.) The\u00a0Fast Track Program serves a similar purpose. As does the\u00a0Breakthrough Therapy designation. Some health researchers are worried that programs like these, along with other factors, are responsible for\u00a0a gradual lowering of the bar of evidence for new drugs in the US. Calling for an acceleration of cures, as the authors do, isn\u2019t really anything new. Makary and Prasad also list artificial intelligence as a priority\u2014specifically, generative AI. They write that \u201con May 8, 2025, the agency implemented the first AI-assisted scientific review pilot using the latest generative AI technology.\u201d It\u2019s not clear exactly which technology was used, or how. But this priority didn\u2019t surprise Rachel Sachs, a professor of health law at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cBoth this administration and the previous administration were very interested in the use of AI technologies,\u201d she says. She points out that as of last year, the FDA\u00a0had already approved over a thousand medical devices that make use of AI and machine learning. And the agency has also been considering how it might use the technologies in its review process, she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s not a new idea.\u201d There\u2019s another sticking point. Writing a list of priorities in JAMA is one thing. Implementing them amid hugely disruptive and damaging cuts underway across federal health and science agencies is quite another.",
    "Makary and Prasad have both made claims to the effect that they support \u201cgold standard\u201d science and have built their careers on extolling the virtues of evidence-based medicine. But it\u2019s hard to square this position with the actions of the administration, including the\u00a0huge budget cuts made to the National Institutes of Health, restrictions on government-funded research, and\u00a0mass layoffs across multiple government health agencies, including the FDA. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the two sides are talking past each other,\u201d says Sachs. As a result, it's impossible to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019ll have to wait to see how this all pans out.
