    "Many managers view gaming as a frivolous activity, reflecting poorly on discipline and productivity. However, research increasingly shows that gaming can build cognitive, social, and emotional skills that are relevant to organizational success. Skills developed through various types of gaming, including tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) and video games, are becoming more critical as organizations navigate complex environments. TTRPGs like Dungeons & Dragons foster collaboration, creativity, and leadership, challenging the negative stereotypes associated with gamers. Video games can build cognitive abilities like quicker reaction times and stress management skills. To overcome the stigma against gamers, managers should ask potential hires about their gaming experience, encourage gaming conversations in the workplace, and lead by example by engaging in gaming themselves. Normalizing gaming not only supports inclusivity but also helps organizations recognize and harness the diverse skills gaming can bring to the workforce.",
