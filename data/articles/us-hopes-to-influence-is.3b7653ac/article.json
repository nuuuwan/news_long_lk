    "On October 14th the US delivered the first components of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile\u2011defence system\u2014which will be operated by 100 US troops\u2014to Israel. According to media reports, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, subsequently informed Joe Biden, the US president, that Israel would not strike Iranian nuclear or energy facilities in its widely expected retaliatory attack in response to Iran\u2019s missile barrage against Israel earlier in the month. We expect Israel to broadly align with the US on this issue and to strike a military target in Iran in the coming weeks.",
    "The US and Israel have been engaged in intense negotiations about the targets of a probable Israeli attack in retaliation for Iran\u2019s October 1st missile attack against Israel. Despite the US\u2019s long-standing position as Israel\u2019s closest ally and main security guarantor, the US has struggled to influence or restrain Israeli military actions since the outbreak of the Israel\u2011Hamas war both in the Gaza conflict and, since late September, in Israel\u2019s intense offensive against Hizbullah, an Iranian-sponsored Lebanese Shia group.",
    "Mr Netayanhu has had a testy relationship with Mr Biden and has reportedly made promises to him that were broken later. Mr Netanyahu has also made clear that the final decision about targeting Iran would depend on Israel\u2019s own national interests, but taking a stance that could be seen to influence the outcome of the US elections (which take place on November 5th) could also prove to be counter-productive for Israel. Israel also risks opening a third major front, if it selects a target that would trigger a sustained confrontation with Iran.",
    "The US is struggling to balance providing security protection to Israel while not emboldening Israel to act beyond what the US views as its broader regional and global security interests. Although the Biden administration has explicitly acknowledged Israel\u2019s right to retaliate against the direct attack from Iran, it is concerned that an attack on Iranian oil installations would knock out enough global supply to raise petroleum prices or prompt a wider regional conflagration (not our central scenario).",
    "An Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities would potentially be viewed by the regime there as a systemic threat and could not only provoke a major retaliation directed against Israel but could also trigger an acceleration of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme or attacks on Saudi and other Gulf oil installations (not our main scenario), which would drive up international oil prices further. The US believes (and so do many in Israel) that an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities stands a poor chance of succeeding, owing to Israel\u2019s lack of bunker-busting bombs powerful enough to destroy sites lying deep underground. In addition, an unsuccessful Israeli attack might prompt Iran to accelerate its nuclear weapons programme.",
    "Moreover, Israel\u2019s ability to defy the US on this issue is constrained by concerns about its ability to withstand an Iranian counter-attack as effectively as it has\u00a0defended\u00a0itself against past missile attacks. Media reports say that the last Iranian attack depleted much of Israel\u2019s stock of Arrow\u00a0(anti-ballistic missiles) and David\u2019s Sling\u00a0(a system developed jointly by Israel and the US to counter longer\u2011range missiles) anti-missile missiles, which are the main components of Israel\u2019s own highly developed interception systems\u2014hence the Israeli request for the THAAD system to fortify its ability to counter ballistic missiles.",
    "Once the THAAD becomes operational, we expect an Israeli targeted strike in the coming weeks.\u00a0Israel will probably choose from among an array of Iranian military targets, including missile and drone launchers, storage sites and factories, as well as military bases and possibly major government buildings.\u00a0Given\u00a0Iran\u2019s reluctance\u00a0to be drawn into direct conflict with Israel, we expect it to absorb this attack, but fighting in Gaza and Lebanon will continue into early 2025. However, the risk of further escalation remains\u00a0high.",
