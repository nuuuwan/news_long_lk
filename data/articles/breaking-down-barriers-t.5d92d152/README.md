Women of color continue to be underrepresented in the tech industry. In this article, the author describes the findings from her doctoral research on workplace belonging. The goal of the study was to measure the level of workplace belonging reported, the top belonging contributors and detractors, and to identify recommendations to increase it. Peers and coworkers were reported as the highest contributors to belonging, and organizational culture was reported as the top detractor. The author offers three recommendations to boost workplace belonging: 1) Invest in programs that foster peer-based relationships, 2) Enable sponsorship and mentoring opportunities, and 3) Hold leaders accountable to “walk the talk.”

The underrepresentation of women of color in technology continues to be a persistent issue. “While 27% of computing roles in the U.S. market are held by women, just 3% and 2% are held by African-American and Hispanic American/Latina women respectively,” according to a research report from Accenture. And “women overall leave tech roles at a 45% higher rate than men.” Given these dismal statistics, tech companies must invest in ensuring women of color are retained in the workplace.
