Sri Lanka's recent decision to outsource its visa issuance to VFS Global has sparked controversy due to what critics say was a secretive selection process and a lack of consideration for alternatives that may have offered better value for money. There is criticism that the public and parliament only learned crucial details about the 12-year contract, which could not be changed without legal repercussions, after it began. The government justified the lack of a competitive bidding process by claiming it believed no competitors could challenge VFS Global's market dominance. Critics claim there has been no clear explanation for the $25 visa application fee or the 12-year contract period, suggesting potential corruption. They warn that the high visa cost could damage the country's tourism industry.
