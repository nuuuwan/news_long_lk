When idea pitches fail to resonate, it doesn’t always have to do with the merit of the idea, your presentation style, or charisma; the problem could stem from a deeper disengagement in your organization. To make pitches more appealing and increase the chances of ideas resonating, the author recommends engaging three main learning styles that may be in your audience: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Drawing from his experience at Disney, the author uses examples of successful presentations in each style and gives tips on engaging each. For visual learners, use images, charts, and visual aids; for auditory learners, employ compelling narratives, varied tones, and relevant sounds; and for kinesthetic learners, include hands-on elements and physical activities.

Imagine you’re in a meeting, pitching a killer idea you’ve been working on, but it’s like tossing a sparkler into a pool: it fizzles out; no fireworks. The issue isn’t merely a matter of your idea, presentation style, or charisma. It often stems from a deeper problem of disengagement within the organization. In an age where only 33% of workers are engaged, how can you ensure your idea pitches land successfully?
