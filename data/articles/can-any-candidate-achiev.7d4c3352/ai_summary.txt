Elections are due to take place in Sri Lanka between September and October this year, with no clear favorite looking likely to secure more than 50% of the vote, leading to potential multiple rounds of vote counting. Past elections have seen the winning candidate collect between 50.4% and 62.28% of the vote, with varying levels of election-related violence and allegations of misconduct. The current incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to leave office, with his term completed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, elected by Parliament in a secret ballot. The country faces significant economic challenges, with poverty widespread and living costs high, which could influence the election outcome. Further, there is talk of a boycott by Tamil voters, which could result in no candidate securing the necessary votes needed for an outright win.
