In a statement, they added that they consider voting a spiritual-political act, which is an opportunity for voters to not only exercise their rights to choose their leaders, but also express compassion and solidarity with marginalised and vulnerable groups and contribute towards a better country for all. All Sri Lankans should focus on the commitment of candidates to these ideals including bringing realistic policies that will bring \u201cgood news to the poor\u00a0 and oppressed\u201d (Luke 4:18) and ensure \u201clife in its fullness for all\u201d (John 10:10), they further said.",

    "Boycotts and Wasting of Votes",
    "The NCCSL notes with concern that some persons and groups are considering and promoting the boycotting of\u00a0 elections or wasting their votes. This has also happened in the past in Sri Lanka and other countries. The NCCSL acknowledges that these campaigns may be based on disappointments and frustration at the unwillingness and\u00a0 inability of those elected by the majority to address long-standing and legitimate grievances of numerical minorities\u00a0 and other marginalised persons and communities. However, the NCCSL believes that the upcoming elections offer\u00a0 opportunities for a better future for all Sri Lankans and thus calls upon all Sri Lankans to use their democratic right\u00a0 to vote to ensure that the best person is elected to the powerful office.",
    "All citizens who are eligible to vote and may have any doubts about the possibility of casting their votes should contact relevant officials or seek guidance well in advance.",
    "All voters are encouraged to clearly indicate their 1st, 2nd and possibly even 3rd preference of candidates, as the\u00a0 preference votes may determine the winner in this closely fought election.",
    "All voters are encouraged to cast their votes as early as possible on the day of elections.",
    "The NCCSL added that the Sri Lankan constitution recognises that \u201cSovereignty lies in the People and is inalienable\u201d and that \u201cSovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise\u201d. They thus called upon all Sri Lankans to exercise their civic duty and exercise their franchise with responsibility."
