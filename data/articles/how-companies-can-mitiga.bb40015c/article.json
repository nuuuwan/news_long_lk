    "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly ubiquitous in business and governance, its substantial environmental impact \u2014 from significant increases in energy and water usage to heightened carbon emissions \u2014 cannot be ignored. By 2030, AI\u2019s power demand is expected to rise by 160%. However, adopting more sustainable practices, such as utilizing foundation models, optimizing data processing locations, investing in energy-efficient processors, and leveraging open-source collaborations, can help mitigate these effects. These strategies not only reduce AI\u2019s environmental footprint but also enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, balancing innovation with sustainability.",
    "By 2026, computing power dedicated to training AI is expected to increase tenfold. As more power is expended, more resources are needed. As a result, we\u2019ve seen exponential increases in energy and perhaps more unexpectedly, water consumption. Some estimates even show running a large AI model generates more emissions over its lifetime than the average car. A recent report from Goldman Sachs found that by 2030, there will be a 160% increase in demand for power propelled by AI applications.",
