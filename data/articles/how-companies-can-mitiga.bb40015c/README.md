# How Companies Can Mitigate AI’s Growing Environmental Footprint

## Summary 🤖

1️⃣ Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in business and global governments, but its environmental impact is substantial, leading to higher power and water usage, and greater carbon emissions. 🌏💻
2️⃣ By 2030, the power demand for AI is predicted to increase by a whopping 160%. ⚡📈
3️⃣ To mitigate the environmental impact, sustainable practices such as foundation models can be employed. 🌱⚖️
4️⃣ Besides, optimizing data processing locations, investing in energy-efficient processors, and engaging in open-source collaborations can also help. 🌐💡
5️⃣ These strategies not only reduce the environmental effects of AI but also improve operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 🔄💰
6️⃣ In the next 5 years, the computing power needed for training AI is anticipated to increase ten times. 🖥️💹
7️⃣ This increased need for power means more resources are required leading to a sky-rocketing consumption of energy and water resources. 🛢️💧
8️⃣ Surprisingly, some estimates show that running a large AI model might generate more emissions over its lifetime than an average car! 🚗🌪️
9️⃣ Goldman Sachs' recent report indicates that by 2030, AI applications will drive a 160% increase in the demand for power. 🔌⚠️
🔟 By adopting sustainable practices, it is believed that innovation can be balanced with sustainability. 💼🍃

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly ubiquitous in business and governance, its substantial environmental impact — from significant increases in energy and water usage to heightened carbon emissions — cannot be ignored. By 2030, AI’s power demand is expected to rise by 160%. However, adopting more sustainable practices, such as utilizing foundation models, optimizing data processing locations, investing in energy-efficient processors, and leveraging open-source collaborations, can help mitigate these effects. These strategies not only reduce AI’s environmental footprint but also enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, balancing innovation with sustainability.

By 2026, computing power dedicated to training AI is expected to increase tenfold. As more power is expended, more resources are needed. As a result, we’ve seen exponential increases in energy and perhaps more unexpectedly, water consumption. Some estimates even show running a large AI model generates more emissions over its lifetime than the average car. A recent report from Goldman Sachs found that by 2030, there will be a 160% increase in demand for power propelled by AI applications.
