1️⃣ Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in business and global governments, but its environmental impact is substantial, leading to higher power and water usage, and greater carbon emissions. 🌏💻
2️⃣ By 2030, the power demand for AI is predicted to increase by a whopping 160%. ⚡📈
3️⃣ To mitigate the environmental impact, sustainable practices such as foundation models can be employed. 🌱⚖️
4️⃣ Besides, optimizing data processing locations, investing in energy-efficient processors, and engaging in open-source collaborations can also help. 🌐💡
5️⃣ These strategies not only reduce the environmental effects of AI but also improve operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 🔄💰
6️⃣ In the next 5 years, the computing power needed for training AI is anticipated to increase ten times. 🖥️💹
7️⃣ This increased need for power means more resources are required leading to a sky-rocketing consumption of energy and water resources. 🛢️💧
8️⃣ Surprisingly, some estimates show that running a large AI model might generate more emissions over its lifetime than an average car! 🚗🌪️
9️⃣ Goldman Sachs' recent report indicates that by 2030, AI applications will drive a 160% increase in the demand for power. 🔌⚠️
🔟 By adopting sustainable practices, it is believed that innovation can be balanced with sustainability. 💼🍃
