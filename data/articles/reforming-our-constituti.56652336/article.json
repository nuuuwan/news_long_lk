    "A strong Constitution protects citizens\u2019 rights, guarantees equality before the law, and ensures efficient, transparent, and accountable governance",
    "Parliament of Sri Lanka and the Constitution",
    "A nation at a crossroads",
    "The economic and social crises of 2022 marked a turning point in Sri Lanka\u2019s modern history. They forced the nation to confront an uncomfortable truth: our constitutional framework\u2014designed to centralise political power\u2014has long contributed to national decline.",
    "Out of that turmoil emerged a renewed call for genuine constitutional reform\u2014a demand for a fair, people-centred system built on peace, prosperity, and zero tolerance for corruption. The current government was elected on this mandate and pledged to complete this long-overdue task. It is now the duty of every citizen to ensure that the promise is fulfilled. Drafting, debating, and passing a new constitution\u2014culminating in a national referendum\u2014may take more than two years. By then, political rivalries could once again derail progress.",
    "Learning from history",
    "Since its independence in 1948, Sri Lanka has adopted three constitutions. The first, drafted by Sir Ivor Jennings, followed the Westminster model. The 1972 Constitution declared Sri Lanka a republic, while the 1978 Constitution introduced the executive presidency\u2014later amended 22 times\u2014concentrating power in the hands of a few and weakening constitutional governance.",
    "Global experience shows that countries adopting executive presidencies without adequate checks and balances often drift toward authoritarianism and economic stagnation. In contrast, Commonwealth nations that retained parliamentary democracy\u2014such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, and Singapore\u2014have generally prospered.",
    "Meanwhile, nations that embraced presidential systems, blurring the separation of powers\u2014such as Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and Nigeria\u2014have faced recurring instability. The Nordic countries, consistently ranking among the world\u2019s strongest democracies, further demonstrate that democratic governance and development go hand in hand.",
    "The \u2018Aragalaya\u2019 of 2022 was a people\u2019s movement demanding accountability and reform. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to rebuild public trust through a constitution that genuinely reflects the will of the people.",
    "Parliament must act now to safeguard this process\u2014possibly through a two-thirds majority\u2014to ensure reform remains free from political manipulation and that current representatives can complete their terms without disruption. Delaying tactics disguised as \u201cfurther deliberation\u201d must be resisted. Issues such as delimitation should not hinder progress; a nationwide referendum will ultimately decide the final constitution. After decades of politics defined by ethnicity, religion, and region, the public has had enough of division. Reform delayed is reform denied.",
    "Principles for a people\u2019s Constitution",
    "A strong constitution protects citizens\u2019 rights, guarantees equality before the law, and ensures efficient, transparent, and accountable governance. Sri Lanka\u2019s next constitution must:",
    "Guarantee equality before the law for all citizens\u2014regardless of ethnicity, religion, or background\u2014without granting undue privileges to any group.",
    "Recognise diversity within a framework of shared citizenship, promoting inclusion and unity.",
    "Clearly define the powers and responsibilities of national and provincial administrations within a unitary framework.",
    "Uphold constitutional conventions and public ethics that reinforce accountability and the national interest.",
    "The constitution must be published in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, with the English version serving as the authoritative text for legal interpretation. This will reduce ambiguity and build confidence among all communities, particularly minorities who rely on English for civic and legal engagement.",
    "Practical governance for a small nation",
    "With a population of just 22 million, Sri Lanka does not need a sprawling political system modelled on global superpowers. What the country needs is an affordable, efficient, and accountable structure that reflects the people\u2019s will and reinforces our identity as a Democratic Socialist Republic.",
    "Our existing three-pillar system aligns with liberal democratic principles, but the 1978 reforms and subsequent amendments distorted that balance. It is time to restore effective governance through a unitary model\u2014one national government with clearly defined, limited powers delegated to autonomous provincial administrations. This model can empower regions to develop their unique strengths in culture, resources, and values, within a single national framework of security and stability.",
    "In an increasingly interconnected world, unity combined with local autonomy is not just a moral imperative\u2014it is an economic and strategic necessity.",
    "Building accountability into the future",
    "Every constitution must evolve. We therefore propose the establishment of a permanent, independent Constitutional Commission composed of designated representatives from multiple disciplines, professional bodies, social sectors, and regional nominees. This body would periodically evaluate the constitution\u2019s performance, identify weaknesses, and recommend reforms to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.",
    "Such a mechanism would ensure that the constitution remains relevant in a rapidly changing geopolitical environment\u2014protecting Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty, avoiding dependency, and preventing the nation from becoming a pawn in global power politics or trapped once again in unsustainable debt.",
    "Sri Lanka has the wisdom and capacity to craft a constitution that reflects its people\u2019s aspirations, strengthens democratic governance, and safeguards cultural values. Now is the moment to act\u2014calmly, rationally, and united in purpose\u2014before political inertia squanders this rare opportunity.",
    "The success of this endeavour depends on building strong institutions\u2014an independent judiciary, a robust legislature, a free press, an efficient bureaucracy, and adequate checks and balances. Our focus must be on empowering systems, not individuals.",
