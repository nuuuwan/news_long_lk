    "A bill that allows medical clinics to sell unproven treatments has been passed in Montana.\u00a0 Under the legislation, doctors can apply for a license to open an experimental treatment clinic and recommend and sell therapies not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to their patients. Once it\u2019s signed by the governor, the law will be the most expansive in the country in allowing access to drugs that have not been fully tested.\u00a0 Related StoryLongevity enthusiasts want to create their own independent state. They\u2019re eyeing Rhode Island.Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro has provided a temporary home for people who plan to set up a new jurisdiction to encourage biohacking and fast-track drugs that slow or reverse aging.",
    "The bill allows for any drug produced in the state to be sold in it, providing it has been through phase I clinical trials\u2014the initial, generally small, first-in-human studies that are designed to check that a new treatment is not harmful. These trials do not determine if the drug is effective. The bill, which was passed by the state legislature on April 29 and is expected to be signed by Governor Greg Gianforte, essentially expands on existing Right to Try legislation in the state. But while that law was originally designed to allow terminally ill people to access experimental drugs, the new bill was drafted and lobbied for by people interested in extending human lifespans\u2014a group of longevity enthusiasts that includes scientists, libertarians, and influencers.",
    "These longevity enthusiasts are hoping Montana will serve as a test bed for opening up access to experimental drugs. \u201cI see no reason why it couldn\u2019t be adopted by most of the other states,\u201d said Todd White, speaking to an audience of policymakers and others interested in longevity at an event late last month in Washington, DC. White, who helped develop the bill and directs a research organization focused on aging, added that \u201cthere are some things that can be done at the federal level to allow Right to Try laws to proliferate more readily.\u201d\u00a0 Supporters of the bill say it gives individuals the freedom to make choices about their own bodies. At the same event, bioethicist Jessica Flanigan of the University of Richmond said she was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the measure, because \u201cit\u2019s great any time anybody is trying to give people back their medical autonomy.\u201d",
    "Ultimately, they hope that the new law will enable people to try unproven drugs that might help them live longer, make it easier for Americans to try experimental treatments without having to travel abroad, and potentially turn Montana into a medical tourism hub. But ethicists and legal scholars aren\u2019t as optimistic. \u201cI hate it,\u201d bioethicist Alison Bateman-House of New York University says of the bill. She and others are worried about the ethics of promoting and selling unproven treatments\u2014and the risks of harm should something go wrong. Easy access? No drugs have been approved to treat human aging. Some in the longevity field believe that regulation has held back the development of such drugs. In the US, federal law requires that drugs be shown to be both safe and effective before they can be sold. That requirement was made law in the 1960s following the thalidomide tragedy, in which women who took the drug for morning sickness had babies with sometimes severe disabilities. Since then, the FDA has been responsible for the approval of new drugs.\u00a0\u00a0 Typically, new drugs are put through a series of human trials. Phase I trials generally involve between 20 and 100 volunteers and are designed to check that the drug is safe for humans. If it is, the drug is then tested in larger groups of hundreds, and then thousands, of volunteers to assess the dose and whether it actually works. Once a drug is approved, people who are prescribed it are monitored for side effects. The entire process is slow, and it can last more than a decade\u2014a particular pain point for people who are acutely aware of their own aging.\u00a0 Related StoryWho gets to decide who receives experimental medical treatments?For many patients, pushing for access to unproven treatments is their best chance of survival. And that\u2019s worth the risk.",
    "But some exceptions have been made for people who are terminally ill under Right to Try laws. Those laws allow certain individuals to apply for access to experimental treatments that have been through phase I clinical trials but have not received FDA approval. Montana first passed a Right to Try law in 2015 (a federal law was passed around three years later). Then in 2023, the state expanded the law to include all patients there, not just those with terminal illnesses\u2014meaning that any person in Montana could, in theory, take a drug that had been through only a phase I trial. At the time, this was cheered by many longevity enthusiasts\u2014some of whom had helped craft the expanded measure. But practically, the change hasn\u2019t worked out as they envisioned. \u201cThere was no licensing, no processing, no registration\u201d for clinics that might want to offer those drugs, says White. \u201cThere needed to be another bill that provided regulatory clarity for service providers.\u201d",
    "So the new legislation addresses \u201chow clinics can set up shop in Montana,\u201d says Dylan Livingston, founder and CEO of the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives, which hosted the DC event. Livingston built A4LI, as it\u2019s known, a few years ago, as a lobbying group for the science of human aging and longevity. Livingston, who is exploring multiple approaches to improve both funding for scientific research and to change drug regulation, helped develop and push the 2023 bill in Montana with the support of State Senator Kenneth Bogner, he says. \u201cI gave [Bogner] a menu of things that could be done at the state level \u2026 and he loved the idea\u201d of turning Montana into a medical tourism hub, he says.\u00a0 After all, as things stand, plenty of Americans travel abroad to receive experimental treatments that cannot legally be sold in the US, including expensive, unproven stem cell and gene therapies, says Livingston.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go and get an experimental gene therapy, you might as well keep it in the country,\u201d he says. Livingston has suggested that others might be interested in trying a novel drug designed to clear aged \u201csenescent\u201d cells from the body, which is currently entering phase II trials for an eye condition caused by diabetes. \u201cOne: let\u2019s keep the money in the country, and two: if I was a millionaire getting an experimental gene therapy, I\u2019d rather be in Montana than Honduras.\u201d  \u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d Honduras, in particular, has become something of a home base for longevity experiments. The island of Roat\u00e1n is home to the Global Alliance for Regenerative Medicine clinic, which, along with various stem cell products, sells a controversial unproven \u201canti-aging\u201d gene therapy for around $20,000 to customers including wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson.\u00a0 Related StoryBryan Johnson wants to start a new religion in which \u201cthe body is God\u201dThe multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI.",
    "Tech entrepreneur and longevity enthusiast Niklas Anzinger has also founded the city of Infinita in the region\u2019s special economic zone of Pr\u00f3spera, a private city where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. It\u2019s the second time he\u2019s built a community there as part of his effort to build a \u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d on the island, a place where biotech companies can develop therapies that slow or reverse human aging \u201cat warp speed,\u201d and where individuals are free to take those experimental treatments. (The first community, Vitalia, featured a biohacking lab, but came to an end following a disagreement between the two founders.)\u00a0 Anzinger collaborated with White, the longevity enthusiast who spoke at the A4LI event (and is an advisor to Infinita VC, Anzinger\u2019s investment company), to help put together the new Montana bill. \u201cHe asked if I would help him try to advance the new bill, so that\u2019s what we did for the last few months,\u201d says White, who trained as an electrical engineer but left his career in telecommunications to work with an organization that uses blockchain to fund research into extending human lifespans.\u00a0 \u201cRight to Try has always been this thing [for people] who are terminal[ly ill] and trying a Hail Mary approach to solving these things; now Right to Try laws are being used to allow you to access treatments earlier,\u201d White told the audience at the A4LI event. \u201cMaking it so that people can use longevity medicines earlier is, I think, a very important thing.\u201d",
    "The new bill largely sets out the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for clinics that want to sell experimental treatments, says White. It states that clinics will need to have a license, for example, and that this must be renewed on an annual basis.\u00a0 \u201cNow somebody who actually wants to deliver drugs under the Right to Try law will be able to do so,\u201d he says. The new legislation also protects prescribing doctors from disciplinary action.",
    "And it sets out requirements for informed consent that go further than those of existing Right to Try laws. Before a person takes an experimental drug under the new law, they will be required to provide a written consent that includes a list of approved alternative drugs and a description of the worst potential outcome. On the safe side \u201cIn the Montana law, we explicitly enhanced the requirements for informed consent,\u201d Anzinger told an audience at the same A4LI event. This, along with the fact that the treatments will have been through phase I clinical trials, will help to keep people safe, he argued. \u201cWe have to treat this with a very large degree of responsibility,\u201d he added.  \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to be killing people,\u201d says Livingston.\u00a0 But he also adds that he, personally, won\u2019t be signing up for any experimental treatments. \u201cI want to be the 10 millionth, or even the 50 millionth, person to get the gene therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not that adventurous \u2026 I\u2019ll let other people go first.\u201d Related StoryThe quest to legitimize longevity medicineLongevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there\u2019s a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.",
    "Others are indeed concerned that, for the \u201cadventurous\u201d people, these experimental treatments won\u2019t necessarily be safe. Phase I trials are typically tiny, and they often involve less than 50 people, all of whom are typically in good health. A trial like that won\u2019t tell you much about side effects that only show up in 5% of people, for example, or about interactions the drug might have with other medicines. Around 90% of drug candidates in clinical trials fail. And around 17% of drugs fail late-stage clinical trials because of safety concerns. Even those that make it all the way through clinical trials and get approved by the FDA can still end up being withdrawn from the market when rare but serious side effects show up. Between 1992 and 2023, 23 drugs that were given accelerated approval for cancer indications were later withdrawn from the market. And between 1950 and 2013, the reason for the withdrawal of 95 drugs was \u201cdeath.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that they want to make drugs available after phase I testing,\u201d says Sharona Hoffman, professor of law and bioethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cThis could endanger patients.\u201d \u201cFamously, the doctor\u2019s first obligation is to first do no harm,\u201d says Bateman-House. \u201cIf [a drug] has not been through clinical trials, how do you have any standing on which to think it isn\u2019t going to do any harm?\u201d But supporters of the bill argue that individuals can make their own decisions about risk. When speaking at the A4LI event, Flanigan introduced herself as a bioethicist before adding \u201cbut don\u2019t hold it against me; we\u2019re not all so bad.\u201d She argued that current drug regulations impose a \u201cmassive amount of restrictions on your bodily rights and your medical freedom.\u201d Why should public officials be the ones making decisions about what\u2019s safe for people? Individuals, she argued, should be empowered to make those judgments themselves. Other ethicists counter that this isn\u2019t an issue of people\u2019s rights. There are lots of generally accepted laws about when we can access drugs, says Hoffman; people aren\u2019t allowed to drink and drive because they might kill someone. \u201cSo, no, you don\u2019t have a right to ingest everything you want if there are risks associated with it.\u201d",
    "The idea that individuals have a right to access experimental treatments has in fact failed in US courts in the past, says Carl Coleman, a bioethicist and legal scholar at Seton Hall in New Jersey.\u00a0 He points to a case from 20 years ago: In the early 2000s, Frank Burroughs founded the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs. His daughter, Abigail Burroughs, had head and neck cancer, and she had tried and failed to access experimental drugs. In 2003, about two years after Abigail\u2019s death, the group sued the FDA, arguing that people with terminal cancer have a constitutionally protected right to access experimental, unapproved treatments, once those treatments have been through phase I trials. In 2007, however, a court rejected that argument, determining\u00a0 that terminally ill individuals do not have a constitutional right to experimental drugs. Bateman-House also questions a provision in the Montana bill that claims to make treatments more equitable. It states that \u201cexperimental treatment centers\u201d should allocate 2% of their net annual profits \u201cto support access to experimental treatments and healthcare for qualifying Montana residents.\u201d Bateman-House says she\u2019s never seen that kind of language in a bill before. It may sound positive, but it could in practice introduce even more risk to the local community. \u201cOn the one hand, I like equity,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t like equity to snake oil.\u201d After all, the doctors prescribing these drugs won\u2019t know if they will work. It is never ethical to make somebody pay for a treatment when you don\u2019t have any idea whether it will work, Bateman-House adds. \u201cThat\u2019s how the US system has been structured: There\u2019s no profit without evidence of safety and efficacy.\u201d The clinics are coming Any clinics that offer experimental treatments in Montana will only be allowed to sell drugs that have been made within the state, says Coleman. \u201cFederal law requires any drug that is going to be distributed in interstate commerce to have FDA approval,\u201d he says. White isn\u2019t too worried about that. Montana already has manufacturing facilities for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer. \u201cThat was one of the specific advantages [of focusing] on Montana, because everything can be done in state,\u201d he says. He also believes that the current administration is \u201cpredisposed\u201d to change federal laws around interstate drug manufacturing. (FDA commissioner Marty Makary has been a vocal critic of the agency and the pace at which it approves new drugs.) At any rate, the clinics are coming to Montana, says Livingston. \u201cWe have half a dozen that are interested, and maybe two or three that are definitively going to set up shop out there.\u201d He won\u2019t name names, but he says some of the interested clinicians already have clinics in the US, while others are abroad.\u00a0 Mac Davis\u2014founder and CEO of Minicircle, the company that developed the controversial \u201canti-aging\u201d gene therapy\u2014told MIT Technology Review he was \u201clooking into it.\u201d \u201cI think this can be an opportunity for America and Montana to really kind of corner the market when it comes to medical tourism,\u201d says Livingston. \u201cThere is no other place in the world with this sort of regulatory environment.\u201d hide"
