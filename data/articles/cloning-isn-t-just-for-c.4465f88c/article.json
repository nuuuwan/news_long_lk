    "This week, we heard that Tom Brady had his dog cloned. The former quarterback revealed that his Junie is actually a clone of Lua, a pit bull mix that died in 2023. Brady\u2019s announcement follows those of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Barbra Streisand, who also famously cloned their pet dogs. But some believe there are better ways to make use of cloning technologies.

Cloning itself isn\u2019t new. The first mammal cloned from an adult cell, Dolly the sheep, was born in the 1990s. The technology has been used in livestock breeding over the decades since.",
    "Say you\u2019ve got a particularly large bull, or a cow that has an especially high milk yield. Those animals are valuable. You could selectively breed for those kinds of characteristics. Or you could clone the original animals\u2014essentially creating genetic twins. Scientists can take some of the animals\u2019 cells, freeze them, and store them in a biobank. That opens\u00a0the option to clone them in the future. It\u2019s possible to thaw those cells, remove the DNA-containing nuclei of the cells, and insert them into donor egg cells.",
    "Those donor egg cells, which come from another animal of the same species, have their own nuclei removed. So it\u2019s a case of swapping out the DNA. The resulting cell is stimulated and grown in the lab until it starts to look like an embryo. Then it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate animal\u2014which eventually gives birth to a clone. There are a handful of companies offering to clone pets. Viagen, which claims to have \u201ccloned more animals than anyone else on Earth,\u201d will clone a dog or cat for $50,000. That\u2019s the company that cloned Streisand\u2019s pet dog Samantha, twice. This week, Colossal Biosciences\u2014the \u201cde-extinction\u201d company that claims to have resurrected the dire wolf and\u00a0created a \u201cwoolly mouse\u201d as a precursor to reviving the woolly mammoth\u2014announced that it had acquired Viagen, but that Viagen\u00a0will \u201ccontinue to operate under its current leadership.\u201d Pet cloning is controversial, for a few reasons. The companies themselves point out that, while the cloned animal will be a genetic twin of the original animal, it won\u2019t be identical. One issue is mitochondrial DNA\u2014a tiny fraction of DNA that sits outside the nucleus and is inherited from the mother. The cloned animal may inherit some of this from the surrogate.  Mitochondrial DNA is unlikely to have much of an impact on the animal itself. More important are the many, many factors thought to shape an individual\u2019s personality and temperament. \u201cIt\u2019s the old nature-versus-nurture question,\u201d says Samantha Wisely, a conservation geneticist at the University of Florida. After all, human identical twins are never carbon copies of each other. Anyone who clones a pet expecting a like-for-like reincarnation is likely to be disappointed.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) described it as \u201ca horror show,\u201d and the UK\u2019s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) says that \u201cthere is\u00a0no justification for cloning animals for such trivial purposes.\u201d\u00a0 But there are other uses for cloning technology that are arguably less trivial. Wisely has long been interested in diversifying the gene pool of the critically endangered black-footed ferret, for example. Today, there are around 10,000 black-footed ferrets that have been captively bred from only seven individuals, says Wisely. That level of inbreeding isn\u2019t good for any species\u2014it tends to leave organisms at risk of poor health. They are less able to reproduce or adapt to changes in their environment.",
    "Wisely and her colleagues had access to frozen tissue samples taken from two other ferrets. Along with colleagues at not-for-profit Revive and Restore, the team created clones of those two individuals. The first clone, Elizabeth Ann,\u00a0was born in 2020. Since then, other clones have been born, and the team has started breeding the cloned animals with the descendants of the other seven ferrets, says Wisely. The same approach has been used to\u00a0clone the endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse, using decades-old tissue samples stored by the San Diego Zoo. It\u2019s too soon to predict the impact of these efforts. Researchers are still evaluating the cloned ferrets and their offspring to see if they behave like typical animals and could survive in the wild. Even this practice is not without its critics. Some have pointed out that cloning alone will not save any species. After all, it doesn\u2019t address the habitat loss or human-wildlife conflict that is responsible for the endangerment of these animals in the first place. And there will always be detractors who accuse people who clone animals of \u201cplaying God.\u201d\u00a0 For all her involvement in cloning endangered ferrets, Wisely tells me she would not consider cloning her own pets. She currently has three rescue dogs, a rescue cat, and \u201cgeriatric chickens.\u201d \u201cI love them all dearly,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are a lot of rescue animals out there that need homes.\u201d This article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.
