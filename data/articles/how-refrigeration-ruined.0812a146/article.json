    "Before you buy orange juice, it probably waited, for as long as two years, in a two-story, stainless-steel tank filled with 265,000 gallons of viscous brown slush. It\u2019s orange juice, but with its water and volatile flavor molecules burned off. The result is a simple syrup six times more sugary than juice and devoid of any of an orange\u2019s fruity, floral zing.\u00a0 Bananas? They may not be chilled in the grocery store, but they\u2019re the ultimate refrigerated fruit. It\u2019s only thanks to what Nicola Twilley calls \u201ca seamless network of thermal control\u201d that they\u2019re able to be a global commodity rather than a luxury. And that bag of salad you picked up for dinner? It\u2019s not just a plastic bag but, as Twilley explains in her new book Frostbite: How Refrigeration Changed Our Food, Our Planet, and Ourselves, \u201ca highly engineered respiratory apparatus, designed in layers of differentially semipermeable films to slow spinach, arugula, and endive metabolism and extend their shelf lives.\u201d  Three-quarters of everything in the average American diet, she explains, passes through the cold chain\u2014the network of warehouses, shipping containers, trucks, display cases, and domestic fridges that keep meat, milk, and more chilled on the journey from farm to fork. As consumers, we put a lot of faith in terms like \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201cnatural,\u201d but artificial refrigeration has created a blind spot, says Twilley. We\u2019ve gotten so good at preserving (and storing) food, she writes, that \u201cwe know more about how to lengthen an apple\u2019s life span than a human\u2019s,\u201d and most of us don\u2019t give that extraordinary process much thought at all. \u00a0  Refrigeration is such a significant contributor to global warming and ozone depletion that Project Drawdown points to refrigerant management as the No. 1 thing we can do to mitigate climate change.  \u201cWhat we eat, what it tastes like, where it\u2019s grown, and how it affects both our health and that of the planet: these things shape our daily lives as well as our continued existence as a species,\u201d Twilley writes, \u201cand they\u2019ve been entirely transformed by manufactured cold.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Author Nicola Twilley suits up for a tour of Americold, a global network of 240 temperature-controlled warehouses.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY   At the Delaware warehouse for Citrosuco, one of the world largest orange juice companies, tanks are filled with a variety of frozen orange juice concentrate\u2014different colors and flavors from different seasons and locales, which are eventually mixed together into a finished product.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY     Twilley\u2014a frequent contributor to the New Yorker and cohost of the podcast Gastropod, which looks at food through the lens of science and history\u2014offers in her book a behind-the-scenes look at the cold chain, concluding that \u201cour food system is frostbitten: it has been injured by its exposure to cold.\u201d We\u2019ve gained convenience at the expense, she writes, \u201cof diversity and deliciousness.\u201d\u00a0 Twilley believes that refrigeration is an enabling technology for lots of the downsides we see in our current food system, from the push toward scale and monoculture to a measurable decline in the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables to harmful impacts on our climate. It is such a significant contributor to global warming and ozone depletion, she explains, that Project Drawdown, a climate solutions nonprofit, has pointed to refrigerant management as the No. 1 biggest thing we can do to mitigate climate change.",
    "\u201cOur food system is frostbitten: it has been injured by its exposure to cold.\u201d  We have used refrigeration to solve problems but haven\u2019t done a true accounting of the environmental, nutritional, and even sociocultural costs, Twilley argues. \u201cThe goal of my book was to ask, \u2018Could we do things better?\u2019\u201d\u00a0 You spent years researching enclosed spaces for your previous book, Until Proven Safe: The History and Future of Quarantine, which was co-written with your frequent collaborator and spouse, Geoff Manaugh. It seems like refrigerated food is, in a way, being quarantined.",
    "Yes! Quarantine and refrigeration are both weird ways of using space and time. With refrigeration, you\u2019re building these particular spaces for your food that kind of work as a time machine and allow you to extend the shelf life and also move it around the globe. You\u2019re manipulating geography. In quarantine, you\u2019re using space and time to give you certainty that you won\u2019t get a disease. Both are about control of nature in the end.\u00a0  Americold's Ontario facility.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY    I wouldn\u2019t have thought of refrigeration as a spatial issue, but it makes sense. I was interested in this idea that there was this vast artificial winter we\u2019d built for our food to live in, this artificial cryosphere that is mostly invisible.  You have to cast your mind back to when I first got interested in this, like 15 years ago. Everyone was talking about \u201cfarm to table\u201d\u2014Michael Pollan, Eric Schlosser, Alice Waters. Every trendy new restaurant was farm-to-table. But the focus was all on the farm, which made me curious about the \u201cto\u201d part\u2014how things move from the farm to the table. Pollan showed us what a feedlot looks like; I thought, maybe I can show people the spaces we\u2019ve built for our food to live in after it\u2019s harvested.  We had built this incredibly sophisticated architecture for our food to live in between the farm and the table. All the foodies might go visit the farm, but not that space between. So yeah, it started as a spatial question.\u00a0 Related StoryHow to hack a smart fridgeYour smart home devices know more about you than you might think\u2014and they\u2019re less secure than you\u2019d hope.",
    "All the mechanics and chemicals and manipulation involved in refrigeration seem counter to everything the farm-to-table movement was pushing at that time. Oh, totally. It\u2019s just a giant blind spot, I think, for most people, and for a journalist and writer, that\u2019s always an interesting place to go. The blind spot is where the good stuff is. I don\u2019t think you can understand our modern food system without understanding refrigeration\u2014and it really hadn\u2019t been done.  You write that \u201cfreshness is a belief system.\u201d Tell me more about that. Our concept of what freshness is has radically changed. People don\u2019t know how old their food is\u2014and that is an engineered and deliberate move. Companies aren\u2019t telling you how old your milk is\u2014only when you should throw it out. \u201cBest before\u201d and \u201csell by\u201d dates, which became widespread in the 1970s, are sort of reassuring structures but have no real scientific basis. I\u2019ve been telling people, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re buying an American apple in July, that apple is coming up on its first birthday.\u201d People find that disconcerting. They don\u2019t know how old their food is.\u00a0   Cranberry bins stacked inside a Maritime International warehouse in New Bedford, Massachusetts.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY   Carcasses hang inside the Bronx-based Master Purveyors facility before being processed for restaurants, hotels, and consumers.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY   Forklift charging stations inside Philadelphia\u2019s Wholesale Produce Market.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY     In the 1880s, when people [first] encountered refrigerated foods, many saw them as immoral and dangerous. It was like zombie food. Imagine that previously you\u2019ve known what fresh foods are, and suddenly you\u2019re presented with something that completely confounds that. People felt they were being hoodwinked, tricked, cheated, poisoned. Of course in many cases they were actually being poisoned, because the early warehouse men didn\u2019t know exactly how to store food safely. What\u2019s extraordinary is that, from a 20th- to 21st-century perspective, we think if it isn\u2019t refrigerated, it can\u2019t be fresh, right?",
    "Advertisement In the book, I quote historian William Cronon [who wrote Nature\u2019s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West in 1991]\u2014and I\u2019m paraphrasing\u2014that forgetfulness was refrigeration\u2019s most significant impact. It divorces us from the origin of our food and has turned our understanding of freshness into a belief system by detaching us from any certainty or sense of proximity to our food\u2019s origins.  Paul Rosenblatt, shown here with an ethylene generator, shipped a million boxes of bananas every year from the Banana Distributors of New York facility in the Bronx before his recent retirement. Bananas are the ultimate refrigerated fruit, writes Twilley, subject to the supply chain\u2019s evolving architecture of atmospheric control.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY   Twilley, who writes that she was \u201cflush with excitement at the prospect of being able to create cold from scratch,\u201d built a fridge with the help of Kipp Bradford, an engineer and cofounder of an HVAC startup.COURTESY OF NICOLA TWILLEY     I was also struck by this phrase in your book that \u201ccold is the absence of heat.\u201d You say there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as cold, in that it\u2019s not a thing or a force or a property that exists and is measurable in its own right.\u201d For people like me who always thought of cold as just the opposite of hot, what does this really mean? I only started thinking about what cold actually is, as opposed to its impacts, quite late on in this book. I thought, Oh, wait\u2014 I should learn how to make cold. And then I was of course like, Oh, you don\u2019t make cold. Cooling is just the sense of loss as heat is moved away. It\u2019s really sort of poetic, you know. Cold is absence.\u00a0 As part of my research, I built a fridge to understand how it works. It is an incredibly ingenious piece of thermodynamics. You can understand how it took humans so long to figure it out. As long as there have been humans, they have realized that cold has preservative power, and yet we had not found a way of controlling it for most of human history. Galileo, Francis Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, Robert Boyle\u2014all of them wrestled with cold. What the hell is it? Where does it come from?",
    "The first person to create cold at will was the Scottish doctor William Cullen in the late 18th century, and he didn\u2019t even know what to do with it\u2014it was almost more of a party trick. You imagine the first human who built a fire realized they were onto something, but the first human to make ice artificially didn\u2019t really, and that still kind of blows my mind.\u00a0  Employees of the Jamaica Pond Ice Company make deliveries in Boston, Massachusetts, circa 1890. By the 1850s, it was common for middle-income people to store ice at home. The company had 22 icehouses to provide it to them.LIBRARY OF CONGRESS    I see those historic pictures of giant ice blocks, and the very idea of anyone thinking that transporting those was a good idea seems wild. When you read about Frederic Tudor\u2019s attempts in 1806 to ship ice and become rich, everyone thought he was nuts. The list of reasons why it\u2019s a bad idea is endless: It\u2019s heavy, slippery, it\u2019s cold, and the moment you have it available to ship, guess what? It melts. I mean, on every level, it was a ludicrous project, and people told him so at the time. But without him, I think, people would never have really realized, \u201cOh, cold at scale is not just something that\u2019s nice for, you know, having ice cream or cool drinks in the summer.\u201d It\u2019s fundamentally reshaped how we move food around the world.\u00a0  Are we basically making our world less inhabitable the better we get at refrigeration? Much of human history has been a war of us versus rot. A refrigerator doesn\u2019t stop rot; it is merely slowing it. The sense that we have triumphed over rot leads to a huge amount of food waste.\u00a0 People treat their fridge like a bank vault\u2014you put something in it, and it will be safe. Before domestic refrigerators, you weren\u2019t stockpiling perishable food in the same way. Now that we can, we waste much more food at the consumer level. We\u2019ve been fooled by the endless abundance of the supermarket. Refrigerators have expanded in size, and many households now have more than one. People drive to the store, then fill their refrigerators and freezers so full they can\u2019t find anything in them. That behavior changes the shape of the city: Houses get bigger, roads expand, stores need bigger parking lots. It\u2019s all connected in a way that has really negative impacts on our environment.",

    "But food preservation doesn\u2019t have to mean refrigeration. For me the exciting part is once you see how the cold chain works, you see how to redesign it. We could create a system that produces food that is more delicious, healthier, and better for the environment. There are alternative methods of food preservation. One example is Apeel coating, which\u2014like refrigeration\u2014works by slowing respiration rates, but does so using atmospheric adjustment rather than thermal control. Using this nanoscale coating for fruit and vegetables, you could get the same shelf life as you would in a refrigerator.\u00a0 Cooling has only been the answer for 100 years, and it doesn\u2019t have to be our only answer for the future.\u00a0 This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations."
