    "This is today's edition of\u00a0The Download,\u00a0our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. How a top Chinese AI model overcame US sanctions  The AI community is abuzz over DeepSeek R1, a new open-source reasoning model.\u00a0 The model was developed by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which claims that R1 matches or even surpasses OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o1 on multiple key benchmarks but operates at a fraction of the cost.",
    "DeepSeek\u2019s success is even more remarkable given the constraints facing Chinese AI companies in the form of increasing US export controls on cutting-edge chips. But early evidence shows that these measures are not working as intended. Rather than weakening China\u2019s AI capabilities, the sanctions appear to be driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration.

    "Useful quantum computing is inevitable\u2014and increasingly imminent \u2014Peter Barrett is a general partner at Playground Global, which invests in early-stage deep-tech companies On January 8, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang jolted the stock market by saying that practical quantum computing is still 15 to 30 years away, at the same time suggesting those computers will need Nvidia GPUs in order to implement the necessary error correction.\u00a0  However, history shows that brilliant people are not immune to making mistakes. Huang\u2019s predictions miss the mark, both on the timeline for useful quantum computing and on the role his company\u2019s technology will play in that future.I\u2019ve been closely following developments in quantum computing as an investor, and it\u2019s clear to me that useful quantum computing is inevitable and increasingly imminent. And that\u2019s good news, because the hope is that they will be able to perform calculations that no amount of AI or classical computation could ever achieve. Read the full story.  The must-reads I\u2019ve combed the internet to find you today\u2019s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.",
