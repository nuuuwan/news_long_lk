    "By Janani Kandaramage",
    "Former UN diplomat Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka delivered a pointed critique of global institutions over their response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza on Tuesday.",
    "Addressing a room of civil society representatives at the Founders\u2019 Day of the All Ceylon Union of Muslim League Youth Fronts, Dr. Jayatilleka underscored the growing failure of international mechanisms to deliver justice \u2013 warning that this erosion of credibility threatens the legitimacy of the multilateral order and enables impunity for powerful actors.",
    "Reflecting on decades of diplomatic service, he recounted his tenure at the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), where he played a leading role in shaping policy on global equity and development. However, it was his recollection of a key moment at UNESCO in 2011 that framed the evening\u2019s central message.",
    "\u201cAt that time, we were under intense pressure,\u201d Dr. Jayatilleka said, referring to a vote on Palestinian membership. \u201cThe US Secretary of State at the time Hillary Clinton warned us there would be consequences \u2014 major funding cuts if we proceeded.\u201d Despite the political risks, he said the choice was clear: \u201cWe voted for Palestine. And for the first time, Palestine was voted into a UN body.\u201d",
    "The move was symbolic, he noted, but one that captured the deeper contradictions within the international system \u2013 where political pressure often overrides principles of justice and self-determination when power is concentrated in the hands of a few nations.",
    "Dr. Jayatilleka also raised grave concerns about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza, asserting that the situation has reached a level of devastation that, in his words, \u201cexceeds even the horrors of the Vietnam War.\u201d",
    "In particular, he criticised the use of starvation as a weapon of war, describing the deliberate deprivation of food to children and civilians as \u201cstate policy masquerading as strategy.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese are not unintended consequences. This is a systemised form of suffering, and the global community is complicit through its silence,\u201d he declared, drawing strong reactions from the room.",
    "At the same time, he acknowledged the severity of the 7 October attacks by Hamas, especially the assault on a music festival, calling it \u201cabhorrent and indefensible.\u201d Nevertheless, he emphasised that Gaza\u2019s collective punishment long predates those events.",
    "Dr. Jayatilleka added that, unlike the war in Ukraine \u2013 where two clear sides are involved: Ukraine, supported by NATO, and an armed Russia \u2013 the situation in Palestine does not involve two conventional armies or states. Instead, it is a one-sided conflict, with one party exerting overwhelming force to displace the other. \u201cWhen a conflict becomes this asymmetrical,\u201d he said, \u201cit is no longer war\u2014it is genocide.\u201d",
    "Speaking about the historical discrimination of Palestinians, the former diplomat said: \u201cThe West imposed sweeping sanctions on Gaza after Hamas was democratically elected in 2006 \u2013 well before the internal Palestinian conflict erupted,\u201d he reminded. \u201cThere was no justice, no fair play from the get-go.\u201d",
    "Elaborating further, he pointed to the inconsistency of international responses to conflict. \u201cEuropean nations were swift in sanctioning Gaza but now seem hesitant even to debate whether Israel\u2019s market access should be reviewed,\u201d he noted, questioning what he called the \u2018selective urgency\u2019 of the global response.",
    "\u201cWe cannot expect global institutions to retain credibility if moral consistency is sacrificed for political convenience,\u201d he warned, noting that inaction sets a dangerous precedent of complacency for nations in conflict.",
    "Acknowledging the significant strides made by student protest movements at elite US universities \u2013 along with the 100,000 demonstrators in the Netherlands rallying against the genocide, he criticised the prevailing political apathy within Sri Lanka in the face of both global and domestic injustices.",
    "\u201cAccording to surfers, Israeli nationals have illegally established businesses and religious centres in Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka, raising concerns about national sovereignty and legal violations,\u201d he remarked, urging the public to harness Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic potential to demand strengthened Government action that upholds law and defends their rights.",
    "He opined that as the conflict in Gaza persists, institutional reform \u2013 particularly within global peacemaking bodies like the UN \u2013 has become increasingly necessary.",
    "However, he also asserted that such change is only achievable through sustained and strategic public pressure, calling on Sri Lankans to actively engage their Government in global efforts advocating for reform.",
