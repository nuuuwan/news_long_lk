In response to 2022 protests advocating for the recovery of stolen assets, Sri Lanka's Government has committed to enacting a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) by April 2024. A draft framework for this Act, detailed in a 182-page report by a committee chaired by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda, outlines mechanisms to manage and return recovered assets. This framework establishes the Proceeds of Crime Management Authority (PCMA) and the Victims of Crime Reparation Trust Fund (VCRTF) but faces criticism for potential risks and procedural flaws.

The framework is criticized for two main issues: the risk of re-stealing recovered assets and potential abuse of power during asset recovery. To address these, the framework should involve more public participation and safeguard individual rights more effectively. International examples highlight the high risk of corruption even in asset recovery processes, stressing the need for robust safeguards to prevent the misuse of funds.

Asset handling by the PCMA and VCRTF requires stringent protections against fraud and corruption. Furthermore, the draft framework allows investigative overreach without sufficient judicial oversight. Public participation, as endorsed by the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), is essential. This includes granting legal standing to citizens in criminal proceedings and ensuring transparency through access to information, which the current framework lacks.

The proposed framework should not be rushed but rather subjected to broader public consultation to address high-level corruption effectively. Improvements needed include better due-process safeguards, public legal standing in recovery processes, and removal of clauses that restrict freedom of information. This law will face resistance from powerful entities, thus, achieving an appropriate balance between swift asset recovery and protecting individual rights is paramount.
