Opinions:
- The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has urged the Union Minister for External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, to convene the Joint Working Group to secure the release of all the fishermen and their boats from Lankan custody.
- Stalin also insisted on measures to prevent further arrests in the future and highlighted how the frequent arrests of fishermen from Tamil Nadu have created an atmosphere of insecurity amongst the fishing community.
- The article suggests that the Sri Lankan Navy’s account of the mid-sea confrontation reflects a long-standing fisheries conflict in the Palk Strait, which deeply affects the daily waged fisherfolk in northern Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu but lacks any durable solution.
- Leaders of the northern fishing community in Sri Lanka have appealed for a “progressive” solution to the fisheries conflict that “threatens the historically strong relationship” between the Tamil communities in both countries.
