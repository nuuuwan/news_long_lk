As they prepare for the coming years’ likely trade battles, company leaders — particularly CEOs and boards — need to recognize that uncertainty and volatility won’t be short-term things; they’re becoming features of the global trade system. To thrive in this kind of environment, leaders need to be opportunistic and strategic at the same time: quick to see a threat or seize on an opening, but also long-term smart about industry trends and competitive dynamics. It’s not easy, but the alternative is to be stuck a step behind. Leadership teams need to craft a five-part response, which includes three immediate actions and two longer-term initiatives.

As the Trump administration prepares to take power in Washington, businesses around the world need to ready themselves for U.S. actions that impose tariffs or other trade restrictions — and for the actions other countries might take in response. Donald Trump campaigned on a call for a general tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports — and 60% or more on goods imported from China. He has announced his intention to impose immediate 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods unless those countries take action on immigration, while adding an additional 10% to tariffs already extant in China.
