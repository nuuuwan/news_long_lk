Three Fundamental Rights Applications have been filed against the reappointment of “former” High Court Judge Kanishka Wijeratne as the Director General (DG) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). The appointment is being challenged on various grounds, including the lack of transparency in the process, violation of the Anti-Corruption Act (ACA) and Wijeratne's lack of criminal prosecution experience. Additionally, they accuse Wijeratne of benefiting from a conflict of interest as he continued in his position throughout the selection process. The petitioners argue that Wijeratne's reappointment could have serious consequences for the integrity and effectiveness of CIABOC, possibly leading to a standstill in its work. These concerns are set against a backdrop of increasing corruption in Sri Lanka, as indicated by the country's recent drop in the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International.
