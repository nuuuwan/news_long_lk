The construction industry in Sri Lanka has suffered a setback, shrinking by 65-70% during the last four years. Consequently, professionals such as quantity surveyors, architects, and engineers have been leaving the country, resulting in a significant shortage of skilled workers. The drop-off in projects is also impacting the small contractors whose numbers have dwindled from around 5,000 to just 500. The writer of the article, who is the President of the Ceylon Institute of Builders, urged the government to restart halted projects and to introduce a skilled training program to tackle the skills shortage. The author further suggested that investment should be redirected from vehicle importation towards kickstarting the stagnated construction projects, which used to contribute 9% to the country's GDP. Restarting these projects could help to provide economic uplift, as the construction industry is a sector where income is distributed across all levels of society.
