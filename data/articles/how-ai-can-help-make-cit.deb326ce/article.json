    "In recent decades, cities have become increasingly adept at amassing all sorts of data. But that data can have limited impact when government officials are unable to communicate, let alone analyze or put to use, all the information they have access to. This dynamic has always bothered Sarah Williams, a professor of urban planning and technology at MIT. \u201cWe do a lot of spatial and data analytics. We sit on academic papers and research that could have a huge impact on the way we plan and design our cities,\u201d she says of her profession. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t getting communicated.\u201d  Shortly after joining MIT in 2012, Williams created the Civic Data Design Lab to bridge that divide. Over the years, she and her colleagues have pushed the narrative and expository bounds of urban planning data using the latest technologies available\u2014making numbers vivid and accessible through human stories and striking graphics. One project she was involved in, on rates of incarceration in New York City by neighborhood, is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Williams\u2019s other projects have tracked the spread and impact of air pollution in Beijing using air quality monitors and mapped the daily commutes of Nairobi residents using geographic information systems.\u00a0  Cities should be transparent in how they\u2019re using AI and what its limitations are. In doing so, they have an opportunity to model more ethical and responsive ways of using this technology.  In recent years, as AI became more accessible, Williams was intrigued by what it could reveal about cities. \u201cI really started thinking, \u2018What are the implications for urban planning?\u2019\u201d she says. These tools have the potential to organize and illustrate vast amounts of data instantaneously. But having more information also increases the risks of misinformation and manipulation. \u201cI wanted to help guide cities in thinking about the positives and negatives of these tools,\u201d she says.",
    "In 2024, that inquiry led to a collaboration with the city of Boston, which was exploring how and whether to apply AI in various government functions through its Office of Emerging Technology. Over the course of the year, Williams and her team followed along as Boston experimented with several new applications for AI in government and gathered feedback at community meetings. On the basis of these findings, Williams and the Civic Data Design Lab published the Generative AI Playbook for Civic Engagement in the spring. It\u2019s a publicly available document that helps city governments take advantage of AI\u2019s capabilities and navigate its \u00adattendant risks.\u00a0This kind of guidance is especially important as the federal government takes an increasingly laissez-faire approach to AI regulation.",
    "\u201cThat gray zone is where nonprofits and academia can create research to help guide states and private institutions,\u201d Williams says.\u00a0 Related StoryHow the federal government is tracking changes in the supply of street drugsThe National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s new harm reduction initiative is helping prevent needless deaths.",
    "The lab\u2019s playbook and academic papers touch on a wide range of emerging applications, from virtual assistants for Boston\u2019s procurement division to optimization of traffic signals to chatbots for the 311 nonemergency services hotline. But Williams\u2019s primary focus is how to use this technology for civic engagement. AI could help make the membrane between the government and the public more porous, allowing each side to understand the other a little better.\u00a0 Right now, civic engagement is mostly limited to \u201csocial media, websites, and community meetings,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can create more tools to help close that gap, that\u2019s really important.\u201d One of Boston\u2019s AI-powered experiments moves in that direction. The city used a large language model to summarize every vote of the Boston City Council for the past 16 years, creating simple and straightforward descriptions of each measure. This easily searchable database \u201cwill help you find what you\u2019re looking for a lot more quickly,\u201d says Michael Lawrence Evans, head of the Office of Emerging Technology.\u00a0 A quick search for \u201chousing\u201d shows the city council\u2019s recent actions to create a new housing accelerator fund and to expand the capacity of migrant shelters. Though not every summary has been double-checked by a human, the tool\u2019s accuracy was confirmed through \u201ca really robust evaluation,\u201d Evans says.\u00a0  AI tools may also help governments understand the needs and desires of residents.\u00a0The community is \u201calready inputting a lot of its knowledge\u201d through community meetings, public surveys, 311 tickets, and other channels, Williams says. Boston, for instance, recorded nearly 300,000 311 requests in 2024 (most were complaints related to parking). New York City recorded 35 million 311 contacts in 2023. It can be difficult for government workers to spot trends in all that noise. \u201cNow they have a more structured way to analyze that data that didn\u2019t really exist before,\u201d she says. AI can help paint a clearer picture of how these sorts of resident complaints are distributed geographically. At a community meeting in Boston last year, city staff used generative AI to instantly produce a map of pothole complaints from the previous month.\u00a0 AI also has the potential to illuminate more abstract data on residents\u2019 desires. One mechanism Williams cites in her research is Polis, an open-source polling platform used by several national governments around the world and a handful of cities and media companies in the US. A recent update allows poll hosts to categorize and summarize responses using AI. It\u2019s something of an experiment in how AI can help facilitate direct democracy\u2014an issue that tool creator Colin Megill has worked on with both OpenAI and Anthropic.\u00a0 But even as Megill explores these frontiers, he is proceeding cautiously. The goal is to \u201cenhance human agency,\u201d he says, and to avoid \u201cmanipulation\u201d at all costs: \u201cYou want to give the model very specific and discrete tasks that augment human authors but don\u2019t replace them.\u201d",
    "Misinformation is another concern as local governments figure out how best to work with AI. Though they\u2019re increasingly common, 311 chatbots have a mixed record on this front. New York City\u2019s chatbot made headlines last year for providing inaccurate and, at times, bizarre information. When an Associated Press reporter asked if it was legal for a restaurant to serve cheese that had been nibbled on by a rat, the chatbot responded, \u201cYes, you can still serve the cheese to customers if it has rat bites.\u201d (The New York chatbot appears to have improved since then. When asked by this reporter, it responded firmly in the negative to the nibbling rat question.)

    "These AI mishaps can reduce trust in government\u2014precisely the opposite of the outcome that Williams is pursuing in her work.\u00a0 \u201cCurrently, we don\u2019t have a lot of trust in AI systems,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why having that human facilitator is really important.\u201d Cities should be transparent in how they\u2019re using AI and what its limitations are, she says. In doing so, they have an opportunity to model more ethical and responsive ways of using this technology.\u00a0 Next on Williams\u2019s agenda is exploring how cities can develop their own AI systems rather than relying on tech giants, which often have a different set of priorities. This technology could be open-source; not only would communities be able to better understand the data they produce, but they would own it.\u00a0 \u201cOne of the biggest criticisms of AI right now is that the people who are doing the labor are not paid for the work that they do [to train the systems],\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m super excited about how communities can own their large language models. Then communities can own the data that\u2019s inside them and allow people to have access to it.\u201d \u00a0 Benjamin Schneider is a freelance writer covering housing, transportation, and urban policy. hide"
