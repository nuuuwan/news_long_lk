# 3 Ways to Clearly Communicate Your Company‚Äôs Strategy

## Summary ü§ñ

Many business leaders fail to provide enough context for their employees to fully understand a company's strategy. To address this, leaders should explain the alternative strategies that were considered and why they were not chosen, show how each decision aligns with the company's purpose, and involve employees in developing the strategy. The importance of clear communication is illustrated by an aviation accident resulting from a misunderstood instruction. These practices can enhance internal and corporate communication, and help employees grasp business and finance basics, thus leading to an enterprise mindset.

For all the communication around strategy, we know that leaders at many companies don‚Äôt provide the necessary context for employees to understand what the words and sentences in a strategy statement actually mean. What can leaders do to help employees understand enough context to understand a strategy? In this article, the authors offer three recommendations: 1) Present the alternatives considered and explain why they were not adopted. 2) Explain how each choice is linked to the organization‚Äôs purpose. 3) Involve employees in strategy development.

A pilot once told us a story about an accident on an early morning flight in the 1950s. As the aircraft accelerated to take off, the captain noticed his flight engineer‚Äôs sullen expression and called out, ‚ÄúCheer up, George.‚Äù But in his sleepy state, what the engineer heard was, ‚ÄúGear up, George‚Äù ‚Äî and he duly raised the landing gear ‚Äî prematurely as they were not quite airborne. The aircraft sank onto its fuselage and slid to a halt, causing much damage. Luckily, nobody was hurt.
