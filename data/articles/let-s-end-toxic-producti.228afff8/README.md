Toxic productivity is an unhealthy compulsion to be productive at all times, often at the expense of our mental and physical well-being, relationships, and overall quality of life. It’s a common sentiment in today’s work culture, where the drive to be constantly productive is often celebrated, if not expected. But this mindset isn’t just harmful; it’s dangerous. People are already struggling to meet their core job requirements, but when you factor in a staggering 192% increase in weekly meetings post-pandemic, it becomes significantly more challenging. We are over-meeting, over-looping, and over-collaborating — one of the worst work habits brought on by the crisis. Despite the longstanding perception that more hours worked means higher productivity, data and research are finding otherwise. Leaders play a crucial role in either perpetuating or breaking this cycle of toxic productivity.

“I’ll sleep when I’m dead.” I’m embarrassed to admit that this is a line I used to repeat, whether to justify working until 2:00 am to hit a deadline or squeezing in just one more email or skipping meals because “I don’t have time.”
