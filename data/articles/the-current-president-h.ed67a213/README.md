Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ratnapura District MP Thalatha Atukorale, who resigned from her seat in parliament on Wednesday, said she is yet undecided on supporting any of the presidential candidates, but she could no longer remain in the SJB given the manner in which the party is being run.

“There are many reasons why I chose to quit, but I don’t want to say much as we are in the middle of an election campaign. From the beginning, I had the feeling that the leader (SJB leader Sajith Premadasa) was not listening to whatever we told him, and we were not appreciated. There is also no proper plan for the party. In addition to that, there were some issues involving my district,” Ms. Atukorale told the Sunday Times.

After resigning from parliament on Wednesday, the former MP travelled to Ratnapura, where she hopes to speak to her supporters and gauge their views on her decision. “This decision was taken on my own. Some of my voters may not agree with it. Those who agree will stay with me, and then the others might take another path,” she said.

Since her resignation, rumours have been rife that she will extend her support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is the leader of the United National Party (UNP), of which Ms. Atukorale was a member along with most of the others in the SJB.

“I was never for the breakup of the party, but when people who were very close to Mr. Wickremeisnghe started getting away, I also joined them. There was also a group that remained with the UNP who wanted to see that some were out. Mr. Wickremeisnghe also has to bear some responsibility for the split in the party,” she said.

Ms. Atukorale said that after the conclusion of the 2020 general election, she had attempted to bring about rapprochement between the UNP leader and Mr.Premadasa but at the time both were in no mood for compromise, and hence she gave up.

“Soon after the election, I was heartbroken. It is the UNP that got divided. It was the UNPers who came with us when we formed the SJB. Of course now there are some who have come onboard as they have nowhere to go and fear for their political future,” she said.

The former MP said she believes that most of the grassroots level supporters of the UNP want a reconciliation among the two groups. “When the split happened, there were certain things made up against the current president, but after the country went bankrupt, he came forward and he proved himself,” she added.

She said she believes there are many others in the SJB who feel the same way.

“The current president has proven his abilities. He single handedly brought the situation of the country under control. I know not everyone is happy, and we have some way to go, but we can get there together,” she added.

She said despite her joining the SJB, she has always maintained a cordial relationship with Mr. Wickremesinghe and has known him for nearly 50 years.

“I can meet him anytime I want. That relationship I have maintained whatever political differences we may have had. Some SJB key people met him for their own personal perks, to get lands, contracts, and so many other things. There are 19 who got Rs 50 million each from the decentralised budget. I have not done that. I have never asked for personal favours. I am very proud of that. I only want what is good for the country,” she added.

Ms. Atukorale said she has about a month within which to decide which candidate she should support.

She also said she is not deterred by the criticism that has come her way since her resignation. “I believe that when you point a finger at someone, there are four pointing back at you. I don’t engage in third-class politics. I have never attacked anyone or launched personal attacks. I don’t agree with that kind of politics. I will never stoop to this level, but if I decide to speak out, I have many things to say,” she said.

Ms. Atukorale said she has received an invitation for the UNP’s special convention scheduled for this afternoon, but she is undecided on what she’s going to do in the future. “I am only thinking of how things can turn out for the country and the people. I must talk to my people and be guided by what they say,” she added.
