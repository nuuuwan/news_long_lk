The Office of United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) has urged the Sri Lankan government to establish an independent prosecutorial authority and special courts to address international law and humanitarian law violations. The report calls for the enhancement of the Office on Missing Persons and strict investigation into mass graves. In addition to addressing past atrocities due to armed uprisings since the early 1970s, the UN is urged to also address ongoing human rights abuses, such as the genocide in Palestine, and to hold all nations accountable for their crimes, ensuring justice is properly applied to all.
