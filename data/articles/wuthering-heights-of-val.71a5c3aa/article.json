    "The bubbly Valentine\u2019s Day could also be a brand trap",
    "Valentine\u2019s Day spins around romance and gift giving. Without a doubt this day is an eagerly awaited marketing and sales window for many brands. For instance, greeting cards find the highest sales on Valentine\u2019s Day in comparison to other occasions (the popular greeting cards brand Hallmark reports that February is its busiest month, and Valentine\u2019s cards claim 20% of its annual sales). Similarly flowers,\u00a0 chocolates and jewelry too find bigger sales around this time.",
    "Still, as Valentine\u2019s Day has expanded to commercially boosted celebration from its\u00a0 \u00a0day of romantic expressions (that it used to be) , it has also become an opportunity for brands to captivate the consumer with alluring offers. Their massaging plays a pivotal role in positioning them among the Valentine consumers.\u00a0 Confused / misplaced messaging attempts put the brand in peril. Valentine\u2019s Brand campaign messaging would sound routine and straight forward-until it is not.",
    "KitKat\u2019s campaign to encourage people to \u2018Have a Break\u2019 from Valentine\u2019s Day, focused on skipping the \u2018romantic pressure\u2019 of the holiday. While the campaign was well received it also faced unexpected criticism due to its destructive tone (despite the destructive aspect was still being played cheekily).",
    "During 2013 Valentine\u2019s Day Cadbury\u00a0 encouraged promiscuity and invited Facebook users to post pictures of their illicit affairs (!) with \u2018Creme Eggs on the brand\u2019s Facebook page\u201d. With the digital campaign the brand pushed \u201cCreme Eggs\u201d from its well known family oriented consumer base to an adult consumer segment, receiving criticism. The family theme (now changed to an adult theme) had overtones of behavior incompatible in family settings.",
    "Can a well known written work which has less focus on romance be remade and replayed coinciding Valentine\u2019s Day well, without abandoning its core? Wuthering Heights (2026-stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, directed by Emerald Fennell) is not a \u201cbrand\u201d as Cadbury / KitKat but simply a movie. It presents the historic novel in a more romantic -and a raunchier-way. Writing in The Australian, the newspaper\u2019s chief film critic Nikki Gemmell says of the movie: \u2018In Emerald Fennell\u2019s hands we get the essence of women-directed sex. Sex through the female gaze. What women actually want. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s filthy. Brace yourselves.\u201d",
    "Let us note that Wuthering Heights movie finds less \u2018love\u2019 but more of \u2018sex\u2019.\u00a0 Despite making it raunchier than the novel, the movie received critical attention (\u201cWuthering Heights became this year\u2019s most divisive film\u201d says BBC!) and has been projected to ace the box office during Valentine\u2019s Day weekend (14-15 February).",
    "The secret? Not definitively known yet. Could it be that by presenting in a raunchier version, while distancing from the boring \u201clove\u201d theme of Valentine\u2019s Day, the movie reinvented its message? Perhaps! Haymarket Media Group Ltd discovered its Valentine\u2019s Day 2026 data to find \u201cthe word \u2018love\u2019 reduces Valentine campaign performance... \u201cThis February 14th signals a need for brands to look beyond the fluff and focus on authentic, inclusive, social-media driven Valentine\u2019s campaigns\u201d Haymarket adds in www.performancemarketingworld.com.",
    "Valentine Day campaigns, to be a success, cannot rely on the well known, routine themes anymore. Innovative, creative presentations are needed... Still, the \u201ccreative\u201d need to balance between the tastes welcomed by the audiences and the brand\u2019s positioning.",
    "That balance is a very fine one.."
