    "It is a yellow blob with no brain, yet some researchers believe a curious organism known as slime mold could help us build more resilient cities. Humans have been building cities for 6,000 years, but slime mold has been around for 600 million. The team behind a new startup called Mireta wants to translate the organism\u2019s biological superpowers into algorithms that might help improve transit times, alleviate congestion, and minimize climate-related disruptions in cities worldwide.  Mireta\u2019s algorithm mimics how slime mold efficiently distributes resources through branching networks. The startup\u2019s founders think this approach could help connect subway stations, design bike lanes, or optimize factory assembly lines. They claim its software can factor in flood zones, traffic patterns, budget constraints, and more. \u201cIt\u2019s very rational to think that some [natural] systems or organisms have actually come up with clever solutions to problems we share,\u201d says Raphael Kay, Mireta\u2019s cofounder and head of design, who has a background in architecture and mechanical engineering and is currently a PhD candidate in materials science and mechanical engineering at Harvard University.",
    "As urbanization continues\u2014about 60% of the global population will live in metropolises by 2030\u2014cities must provide critical services while facing population growth, aging infrastructure, and extreme weather caused by climate change. Kay, who has also studied how microscopic sea creatures could help researchers design zero-energy buildings, believes nature\u2019s time-tested solutions may offer a path toward more adaptive urban systems.

When searching for food, it extends tentacle-like projections in multiple directions simultaneously. It then doubles down on the most efficient paths that lead to food while abandoning less productive routes. This process creates optimized networks that balance efficiency with resilience\u2014a sought-after quality in transportation and infrastructure systems.",
    "The organism\u2019s ability to find the shortest path between multiple points while maintaining backup connections has made it a favorite among researchers studying network design. Most famously, in 2010 researchers at Hokkaido University reported results from an experiment in which they dumped a blob of slime mold onto a detailed map of Tokyo\u2019s railway system, marking major stations with oat flakes. At first the brainless organism engulfed the entire map. Days later, it had pruned itself back, leaving behind only the most efficient pathways. The result closely mirrored Tokyo\u2019s actual rail network. Since then, researchers worldwide have used slime mold to solve mazes and even map the dark matter holding the universe together. Experts across Mexico, Great Britain, and the Iberian peninsula have tasked the organism with redesigning their roadways\u2014though few of these experiments have translated into real-world upgrades. Historically, researchers working with the organism would print a physical map and add slime mold onto it. But Kay believes that Mireta\u2019s approach, which replicates slime mold\u2019s pathway-building without requiring actual organisms, could help solve more complex problems. Slime mold is visible to the naked eye, so Kay\u2019s team studied how the blobs behave in the lab, focusing on the key behaviors that make these organisms so good at creating efficient networks. Then they translated these behaviors into a set of rules that became an algorithm. Some experts aren\u2019t convinced. According to Geoff Boeing, an associate professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, such algorithms don\u2019t address \u201cthe messy realities of entering a room with a group of stakeholders and co-visioning a future for their community.\u201d Modern urban planning problems, he says, aren\u2019t solely technical issues: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how to make infrastructure networks efficient, resilient, connected\u2014it\u2019s that it\u2019s politically challenging to do so.\u201d Michael Batty, a professor emeritus at University College London\u2019s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, finds the concept more promising. \u201cThere is certainly potential for exploration,\u201d he says, noting that humans have long drawn parallels between biological systems and cities. For decades now, designers have looked to nature for ideas\u2014think ventilation systems inspired by termite mounds or bullet trains modeled after the kingfisher\u2019s beak.\u00a0 Like Boeing, Batty worries that such algorithms could reinforce top-down planning when most cities grow from the bottom up. But for Kay, the algorithm\u2019s beauty lies in how it mimics bottom-up biological growth\u2014like the way slime mold starts from multiple points and connects organically rather than following predetermined paths.\u00a0 Since launching earlier this year, Mireta, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has worked on about five projects. And slime mold is just the beginning. The team is also looking at algorithms inspired by ants, which leave chemical trails that strengthen with use and have their own decentralized solutions for network optimization. \u201cBiology has solved just about every network problem you can imagine,\u201d says Kay.
