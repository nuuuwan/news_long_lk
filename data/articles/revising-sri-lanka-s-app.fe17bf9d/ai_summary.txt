🇱🇰 Sri Lanka aims to escalate Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to support infrastructure projects.
🔨 PPPs are collaborations between the government and private sectors, aiming to provide services efficiently.
⚙️ From 1990 to 2017, Sri Lanka was part of 81 PPP infrastructure projects, worth $2,671 million.
🚧 Despite their advantages, PPPs suffer from institutional and regulatory weaknesses in Sri Lanka, including non-compliance with project prioritisation frameworks.
🔍 There's no clear legal framework for PPPs in Sri Lanka currently, with existing guidelines failing to cover important aspects like land rights and foreign investment.
⚖️ New legislation for PPPs is reportedly in the works to address these issues.
🔀 There's also no consistent central authority to oversee PPPs in the country, but the National Agency for Public Private Partnerships (NAPPP) was established in 2017 to fulfil this role.
🔄 NAPPP was restarted in 2022 but still lacks the necessary expertise and capacity to function effectively.
✍️ Reforms should focus on implementing a new PPP law, improving transparency, mandating competitive bidding, and requiring financial and technical feasibility studies.
📚 The NAPPP should also be given legal authority and budgetary provisions to hire skilled personnel, and PPP units should be established within line ministries.
