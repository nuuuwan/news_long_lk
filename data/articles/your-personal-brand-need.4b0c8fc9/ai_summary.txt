Branding expert Dorie Clark and executive coach Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic outlined four main steps for maintaining a personal brand to ensure relevancy in a fast-changing job market. First, they recommend getting a clear vision of what a strong personal brand would look like in the desired professional context. This involves developing a deep understanding of current perceptions and how they might need to change. Next, it's important to create a specific, tactical plan to address any misconceptions and to show the ‘new you’. They also emphasise the necessity of strategic patience as transformation is often a long journey and it may take time for others to adjust their perception of who you are. Lastly, accelerating your career also involves creating smarter aspirations and living up to them. This will help bridge the gap between self-perception and the public brand.
