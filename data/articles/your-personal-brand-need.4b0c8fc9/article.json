    "In a fast-changing world, it requires both a strategy and disciplined execution to stand out and remain relevant. And since your own career interests, goals, and objectives are likely changing more rapidly than ever, don\u2019t assume that your internal state of mind is...more",
    "Fundamentally, brands help people make choices \u2014 and that\u2019s true whether we\u2019re talking about products, objects, or humans. When it comes to personal brands, those choices may involve high-stakes professional decisions, such as whether to hire you, promote you, engage you for coaching or services, and so on. That\u2019s why it can be so challenging when your personal brand has fallen out of date.",
    "Take Eva, for instance. She\u2019s a digital marketer with over 10 years of experience managing creative teams in global enterprises and startups. She\u2019s good at what she does, but doesn\u2019t find it stimulating anymore, so she applies to a variety of roles that align with her current aspirations. But she never hears back from anyone \u2014 perhaps, she realizes a bit too late, because her long-ignored LinkedIn profile showcases skills and experience that seem rather \u201cvintage\u201d for today\u2019s marketplace, and don\u2019t highlight the skills she actually uses every day.",
    "But keeping your personal brand current isn\u2019t just about maintaining social media profiles. Irrespective of your online presence, people hold an image of you in their minds \u2014 and that, too, may be out of date, especially if you\u2019ve made the effort to develop new skillsets.",
    "We\u2019re keenly aware of the need to update our brand when we\u2019re making a conscious career pivot \u2014 a topic Dorie wrote about in her book Reinventing You. But even when you\u2019re remaining in the same job or the same career, you also have to be mindful of your personal brand, because it\u2019s easy to rest on your laurels and forget to update or upgrade your brand while the world (and the requirements of your profession) move on. Notice that while ambition and determination breed success, success tends to breed complacency, so when you get to a certain point of being established and are busy enough with work, it is tempting to assume that your achievements can speak for themselves.",
    "This is a risky situation to be in, since the AI age is disrupting all jobs, industries, and especially human expertise. It may well be time to refresh how you tell your story and convince others that you can add value. Through our experience (Dorie as a keynote speaker and strategist, and Tomas as an executive coach, speaker, and prolific researcher in the science of career success), we believe there are four key steps to ensure you\u2019re offered relevant opportunities and can deploy your full talents.",
    "Get clear on the vision.",
    "What do you want people to see? Think about your current professional goals and identify what a strong personal brand would look like in that context. For instance, how would people think or talk about you if you were a C-suite leader \u2014 or a top contender for such a role? If you\u2019re unsure, look to role models in that field or position \u2014 how are they viewed? What are the actual words you\u2019d like others to use about you? Getting clear on specifics \u2014 you\u2019d like to be seen as \u201cstrategic\u201d and also \u201ccollaborative,\u201d for instance \u2014 can help ensure you put the right plan into place later. Importantly, don\u2019t limit your vision to your current self, but also consider your possible or future selves, which will comprise your current self plus your potential.",
    "You may have a sense that others\u2019 perceptions are off, but be precise. What are they seeing or not seeing that you want to correct? Are there specific instances or things people have said to you that indicate they don\u2019t fully \u201cget\u201d you, or are thinking of how you were in the past (not today)? Importantly, how do you know that they are wrong and you are right, rather than vice-versa? It can be helpful here to talk to trusted friends and colleagues to get their perspective \u2014 and also to comb through the internet for references to you. Ask yourself: What would someone who didn\u2019t know anything about me glean from this information? In fact, you could even try asking those questions to generative AI (like ChatGPT or Perplexity). With the right prompts, these large language models will give you a reasonably good estimate of what most people would think if presented with X or Y information. As Tomas notes in his latest book, I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique, AI can be used as a substitute human coach. When you\u2019re clear on how your ideal self-presentation is falling short (people think of you as a \u201cdoer\u201d rather than a strategist, or they assume without asking that you won\u2019t be the one doing the presentation), you can begin to map out a plan to get from here to there.",
    "Create a tactical plan.",
    "You can\u2019t bullhorn your way to a brand change \u2014 you need to show people the \u201cnew you\u201d over time, repeatedly. This isn\u2019t about taking steps to craft the new identify \u2014 you\u2019re already there. But it\u2019s about making sure others recognize it. Think through the specific misconceptions people hold about you and take action to disarm them. If you\u2019ve strengthened your public speaking skills, volunteer to lead more pitches and proactively speak up more in meetings to showcase your new abilities. And if people see you as a hands-on implementer, don\u2019t be afraid to take (justified) credit if you helped develop the strategy \u2014 and perhaps don\u2019t be so quick to volunteer around execution.",
    "Embrace strategic patience.",
    "We\u2019d all like our reinventions to go faster than they do and have others think of us the way we\u2019d want to \u2014 but as Dorie describes in her book The Long Game: How to Be a Long-Term Thinker in a Short-Term World, we often have to deploy \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d It\u2019s not that patience, per se, is so valuable \u2014 if you can get a faster result, by all means! But many coveted goals, whether it\u2019s winning a promotion or landing a large new enterprise client or even developing an expert reputation, almost inevitably take time. Shortcuts or \u201clife hacks,\u201d while much sought-after, are rarely effective in these contexts.",
    "Another surprising area that may require patience is understanding that others\u2019 view of you may take quite a while to match your new self-conception. Your close friends and family are used to thinking of you in a certain way (\u201cI married a lawyer\u201d), and so a change in your circumstances is also a change to their identity, which may feel uncomfortable and take a while to get over.",
    "In a fast-changing world, it requires both a strategy and disciplined execution to stand out and remain relevant. And since your own career interests, goals, and objectives are likely changing more rapidly than ever, don\u2019t assume that your internal state of mind is reflected in your public brand. Indeed, there\u2019s often a lag between our self-perception and how others view us, and we have to consciously focus on closing that gap to achieve the brand or reputation we seek.",
