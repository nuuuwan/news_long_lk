1. 📉 Fitch Ratings states Ceylon Electricity Board's (CEB) cash flow will remain capable of servicing debt despite a 22.5% tariff cut from July 2024.
2. ⚡ The tariff cut is not expected to influence CEB's payments to independent power producers (IPPs).
3. 💧🔥 Lower tariffs will be backed by decreasing generation costs due to CEB's higher hydropower mix and lower coal price.
4. 💰 Financing costs will also decrease due to lower market interest rates.
5. 📉 The 22.5% average tariff cut ordered by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka was larger than CEB's proposed 10% cut.
6. ☔🔥 A rise in hydropower to 31% and a 32% YoY decrease in coal prices, which fuels 36% of Sri Lanka's generation mix, have led to falling generation cost.
7. 💸 Due to the tariff cut, CEB’s EBITDA margin may decrease to about 11% in 2024, from 26% in 2023.
8. 💼 CEB targets further reductions in operating costs in the near-to-medium term.
9. 🏛️ CEB's rating is equal to parent company, the Sri Lankan sovereign, due to socio-political implications of a possible CEB default and its 100% state ownership.
10. 🍃 IPPs are expecting a further improved average of 80 days payment receivable over the next 12 to 18 months despite the latest tariff cuts.
