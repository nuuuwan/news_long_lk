United National Party's (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara proposed that Sri Lanka's presidential election, due in 2021, and the parliamentary election planned for 2022 be postponed for two years. He suggested that the terms of office for both roles be extended by the same period. Bandara believes that such a move would maintain the economic recovery led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, the proposition was criticised as an attempt to avoid a likely defeat in the presidential election. Some even threatened to stage protests against the proposal. Wickremesinghe has not officially endorsed the plan, but he did defend Bandara's right to express his personal opinion.
