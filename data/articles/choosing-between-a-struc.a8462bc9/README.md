Itâ€™s critical to avoid the financial burden of making a wrong hire. Two approaches to conducting interviews â€” structured and conversational â€” can yield different insights about a candidate. While structured interviews make it easier to compare candidate responses and help ensure each interviewer covers distinct areas without redundancy, they may fall short in uncovering the candidateâ€™s communication style and adaptability to change in a real-world setting. Conversational interviews offer a unique opportunity to get to know a candidate better by engaging them in a discussion about a real problem your organization is facing or has faced, but they can also present greater opportunities for bias to creep in. Hereâ€™s what each interview method can reveal about a candidate and when you might want to use them.

Interviewing candidates involves more than assessing their hard and soft skills â€” itâ€™s crucial to choose the right method to gain a comprehensive understanding of their potential long-term fit for the team and company. During my time in human resources, I frequently encountered new hires who possessed extensive experience and expertise but struggled to adapt, which ultimately benefited no one. This mismatch often stemmed from a lack of alignment between the candidateâ€™s values and the companyâ€™s environment and core principles, as well as the hiring managerâ€™s lack of understanding about a candidateâ€™s long-term career aspirations and motivations.
