    "It\u2019s critical to avoid the financial burden of making a wrong hire. Two approaches to conducting interviews \u2014 structured and conversational \u2014 can yield different insights about a candidate. While structured interviews make it easier to compare candidate responses and help ensure each interviewer covers distinct areas without redundancy, they may fall short in uncovering the candidate\u2019s communication style and adaptability to change in a real-world setting. Conversational interviews offer a unique opportunity to get to know a candidate better by engaging them in a discussion about a real problem your organization is facing or has faced, but they can also present greater opportunities for bias to creep in. Here\u2019s what each interview method can reveal about a candidate and when you might want to use them.",
    "Interviewing candidates involves more than assessing their hard and soft skills \u2014 it\u2019s crucial to choose the right method to gain a comprehensive understanding of their potential long-term fit for the team and company. During my time in human resources, I frequently encountered new hires who possessed extensive experience and expertise but struggled to adapt, which ultimately benefited no one. This mismatch often stemmed from a lack of alignment between the candidate\u2019s values and the company\u2019s environment and core principles, as well as the hiring manager\u2019s lack of understanding about a candidate\u2019s long-term career aspirations and motivations.",
