A study examined the habits of almost 5,000 sales professionals whose livelihoods depend on their ability to build and deliver persuasive presentations. The findings revealed 12 common mistakes that were consistently self-reported among respondents. Here are the top three to avoid when giving a sales presentation: being overly informative vs. persuasive, failing to close, and “winging it.”

When you work in sales, no business skill is more essential than effective communication. This is especially true when it comes to giving presentations, whether you are presenting in person, over the telephone, or via a videoconferencing platform. Getting to the point, connecting with others quickly, and making a strong pitch can be the difference between moving a transaction forward or losing an opportunity.
