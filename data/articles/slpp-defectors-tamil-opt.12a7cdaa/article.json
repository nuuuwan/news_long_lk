    "Every candidate should watch this",
    "Sajith\u2019s Wellassa wave",
    "Can Ranil grab MR\u2019s party, vote-base?",
    "\u201c\u2026In short, the global democratic trend this year is a resounding rejection of the status quo.\u201d",
    "\u2013 \u2018A Global Movement Against The Status Quo\u2019 By Ian Bremmer, TIME, 5 Aug. 2024\u00a0\u2013",
    "Given the global trend as summed-up by Ian Bremmer, one of the world\u2019s best-known think-tank gurus, a win for incumbent Wickremesinghe is virtually unthinkable.",
    "Given the decision by Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s SLPP to fend-off Wickremesinghe\u2019s political piracy and field a candidate under the party banner, a Ranil win is logically impossible.",
    "As PM in 2001-3, Ranil overstepped the mark and encroached on President Kumaratunga\u2019s terrain. She tossed him out. As PM in 2015-2019, he did the same with President Sirisena, was turfed out, made a comeback thanks to the Supreme Court he now derides, and was evicted by the electorate.",
    "Having been unwisely appointed President by the Rajapaksas, he has openly sought to poach their party and been cut off at the ankles. Playing disrespectful tough-guy with Mahinda \u2013 even an aged, unwell Mahinda--who didn\u2019t blink in the face of Prabhakaran (and David Miliband), isn\u2019t smart.",
    "Ranil is intent on reinforcing and enhancing India by physically connecting Sri Lanka with it, but thinks there will be no geopolitical blowback he can\u2019t beat. That\u2019s real dumb.",
    "In 1951, SWRD Bandaranaike followed only by MR\u2019s father DA Rajapaksa, broke away from the UNP of the formidable \u2018Father of Independence\u2019 DS Senanayake and formed the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. 70 years later, after SWRD\u2019s daughter Chandrika had forged a hybrid government of SLFP defectors and Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s UNP, the majority of the SLFP broke away and formed the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, because the official SLFP had betrayed its fundamental orientation.",
    "Today, the bulk of the MPs of the SLPP, formed as a rejection of Governmental collaboration with Ranil\u2019s UNP, is allying with Wickremesinghe in his run for President. These defectors will be unable to convince their voters to pivot to him. Moreover, the SLPP and SLFP Ministers and MPs are the most unpopular legislators in the country. Ever.",
    "It is better for the SLPP to run as itself and be defeated. That happened to Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s SLFP in 1965, 1977 and 1988. The party can retain its identity and (barely) survive. To embrace Ranil however, would be the ultimate betrayal of the party\u2019s brand. If it supports Ranil and craters, there\u2019s no comeback.",
    "Meanwhile, renegade SLPP \u2018Ranilists\u2019 will find politics \u2013 and nominations--impossible at the Parliamentary election.",
    "Beena Sarwar, Director, \u2018Democracy in Debt\u2019",
    "Yoshitha Perera, Cinematographer, \u2018Democracy in Debt\u2019",
    "Vickramabahu: Father of Jana Aragalaya",
    "Tamil politics: Two lines",
    "Though the ITAK no longer enjoys the degree of preponderance it had in Tamil politics, the country and its Tamil citizens must be thankful that it has refused to fall into the trap of a separate Tamil presidential candidacy as agreed upon by a few parties and civic organisations. Sadly, the latter grouping includes the PLOT and EPRLF, two organisations of leftwing provenance whose hallmark was North-South bridge-building.",
    "The project of a Tamil presidential candidate flies in the face of the sage counsel given in writing in 1964 by Lord Soulbury to C. Sunderalingam. While Soulbury was in complete sympathy with the predicament of the Tamil people and self-critical about his over-optimism during the pre-Independence Constitution-making process, his considered advice almost two decades later was that Tamil politics should learn from the Irish and enter an alliance with the most compatible mainstream national party in Parliament. Northern Ireland\u2019s Protestant minority leveraged the Conservatives in Westminster; the Scottish found Labour more compatible. Soulbury suggested that in Ceylon, it would probably be the UNP.",
    "The post-Aragalaya moment has three characteristic features:",
    "1. A new, enlightened consciousness dominates in the Sinhala majority South. Sinhala chauvinism is on the defensive, marginalised as never before.",
    "2. There is a real chance of a generational shift in the island\u2019s political leadership. Anura and Sajith are postwar leaders.",
    "3. The economic crisis has shifted ethnoreligious issues out of the way, de-prioritised ethnoreligious and ethnolinguistic consciousness, bringing very much to the forefront the economic question and competing economic solutions.",
    "The confluence of these triple factors opens a portal which has more positive potential than any I recall.",
    "It is a moment similar to the liberal Blair-Clinton confluence of the 1990s, grasped by the Sinn Fein-IRA whose pivot made the Good Friday agreements and its present political advances possible.",
    "This is exactly the wrong time in history for the Tamil parties to raise the banner of \u201cself-determination\u201d as the Tamil presidential candidacy coalition does. That will only endow the marginalised Sinhala chauvinists with some relevance and resonance.",
    "This is exactly the right time in history for Tamil political parties to enter a coalition with one of the two younger, postwar Presidential aspirants.",
    "However, Tamil political parties must be more mindful than they have ever been about the interests and wellbeing of their partners. For far too long the story has been of Tamil political parties looking over their shoulders at hawkish Diaspora opinion and imposing an overly heavy political burden on its Sinhala partners, which eventually sinks the latter. This was the fate of the Chandrika Kumaratunga and Sirisena-Wickremesinghe constitutional reformist administrations. Sinn Fein-IRA never made the same careless blunder with the Labour government.",
    "\u2018Democracy in Debt\u2019 and Economics of Equilibrium",
    "A good documentary film is one which helps educate you on a subject you didn\u2019t know about or didn\u2019t know very much about. An exceptionally good documentary film is one that educates you on something you actually knew quite a lot about. Sanja and I saw just such a documentary which premiered at the Colombo City Center a few days back. Titled \u2018Democracy in Debt: Sri Lanka Beyond the Headlines\u2019 it was directed by Beena Sarwar, a Pakistani film-maker based in Boston.",
    "Beena\u2019s local collaborator was Dr Ranga Kalansuriya\u2019s Factum with Uditha Devapriya as Lead Researcher and point-man. One of the documentary\u2019s funders was the prestigious Pulitzer Center, USA, which wasn\u2019t surprising since Beena, alumnus of Brown and Harvard universities, has taught journalism at Princeton.",
    "While the title indicates two main protagonists \u2018Democracy\u2019 and \u2018Debt\u2019, the real hero emerges as the former, Sri Lanka\u2019s long-standing and robust democracy, or rather the Sri Lankan people, the citizens, with their existential commitment to democracy which has made it more durable and resilient on this island than in many parts of the world.",
    "While admirable and accurate, this discernment itself only confirmed what I knew, believed in. However, in 25 minutes I felt my perspective shift. As the movie ended, the abiding mental impression was one of asymmetries which had grown into an antinomy. The movie-maker had captured the underlying reality of the Sri Lankan social formation in all its unevenness. The slim autobiographical novel turned movie by Cuba\u2019s Edmundo Desnoes was called \u2018Memories of Underdevelopment\u2019. Beena Sarwar\u2019s documentary \u2018Democracy in Debt\u2019 could have a strap describing it as \u2018Scenes of Sri Lanka\u2019s Uneven Development\u2019.",
    "At one corner, the periphery of Sri Lanka\u2019s dependent capitalism, is life in Dutuwewa, Anuradhapura, \u201cat the edge of the Dry Zone\u201d. The system\u2019s periphery but the island\u2019s heartland. A young farmer explains that Dutuwewa was named after the reservoir (\u2018tank\u2019) where Dutugemunu\u2019s runaway horse had finally stopped. He is almost lyrical in describing how the elaborate system of irrigation built by ancient kings functioned and still does. \u201cIn history, we obviously had leaders who cared about agriculture and that granaries were full. Except for a few initiatives like the Mahaweli Scheme, we no longer have such leaders\u201d. His brother-in-law, a confident, mustachioed war veteran continued the narrative in much the same vein.",
    "Ranil\u2019s overemphasis on agriculture for export\u2014especially, agribusiness-- mirrored in the SJB\u2019s Economic Blueprint and the discourse of Dr Harsha de Silva even in the recent parliamentary debate on the Economic Transformation Bill, fails to resonate in the heartland\u2019s collective soul.",
    "The SJB\u2019s attempt to return to the 1947 UNP\u2019s Buddhist religiosity as a stick to beat the secular-minded JVP-NPP with, while paradoxically abandoning DS Senanayake\u2019s prioritisation of peasant agriculture and rural welfare in favour of an urban neoliberal-globalism, will not persuade the young men and women of Dutuwewa to vote SJB instead of NPP whose Anura Dissanayake seems more empathetic and aware.",
    "The economic crisis has hollowed out faith in the elite. The young farmer says \u201cwe need a movement of youth which will change the whole system\u201d. That\u2019s easy to decode.",
    "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean AKD is the best/better man for the job at the current moment.",
    "However, no economics can succeed if it goes against the ethos of the island, especially the heartland. What Sri Lanka needs is an \u2018Economics of Equilibrium\u2019, where agricultural export is incentivised and encouraged but never at the expense of national food security and domestic surpluses. That\u2019s the kind of policy platform Sajith Premadasa and the SJB Alliance need to launch on August 8th if they are to persuade the voters in the heartland to opt for him rather than the more \u2018socially organic\u2019 AKD.",
    "Ranasinghe Premadasa\u2019s son is perfectly capable of that policy discourse. This was evidenced by the Wellassa wave, the crowd he attracted in Buttala, Monaragala, very much in the heartland and a historic locus of anti-imperialist patriotic rebellion. Unlike his chief economist who actually invoked \u2018Walmart\u2019 to a peasant audience a few months back, Sajith\u2019s messaging was spot on. (https://youtu.be/ffUiZ6PY3J4?si=cTQs8w3RCgPGOxND)",
    "SJB \u2018Walmart wallahs\u2019 should test their ideas at their own\u2014Parliamentary\u2014election, instead of damaging Sajith\u2019s Presidential prospects.",
    "The other end of the Sri Lankan social axis is depicted in Beena Sarwar\u2019s documentary through the lens of young cinematographer Yoshitha Perera. Wordlessly, the drone camera operated under her guidance by Shakthi Madushan Daniel, reveals a different Colombo from the charming city that was my hometown.",
    "It is a dark, mirrored, alien, cityscape rising high above the citizens and looking down on them. Dutuwewa and Colombo are seen through Yoshitha\u2019s lenses, her gaze able to discern the contrasting souls, or the dualism of soul/soullessness, that constitutes the island\u2019s moral antinomies.",
    "Director Beena Sarwar does not permit the glistening black towers of the cold cityscape indelibly captured by Yoshitha Perera to be the last word. She ends the movie leaving with us the humanistic implication and suggestion that while the debt crisis is the result of policies made within that frieze of high-rises by those who live and work there, and for their primary benefit; and while policy responses to the debt crisis travel the same circuits; in Sri Lanka\u2019s durable democracy the bigger choices are made in the last analysis by those who live beneath that skyline and in its shadow: the vast majority of citizens. Democracy determines.",
    "Beena derives this lesson from our unbroken line of elections since 1947, and (largely non-lethal) Aragalaya 2022. With the presidential election imminent, we, the people, stand on the doorstep of democratic decision. Every Presidential candidate and political party leader must watch Beena Sarwar\u2019s memorable mini-movie. (https://youtu.be/Az2hu9lXlrU)",
    "Vickramabahu: Jana Aragalaya Prophet",
    "Dr Vickramabahu Bandara Karunaratne died at 81 last week. Equipped with a Cambridge PhD, he taught in the Engineering Faculty at Peradeniya when I entered university in 1976. Known simply as \u201cBahu\u201d, he was politically the big man on campus, the founder-leader of a growing Trotskyist group, a radical left tendency lodged within the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) then in office in the Sirimavo Bandaranaike-led coalition government.",
    "As a \u2018Stalinist\u2019 belonging to a far-left grouping, who had already been questioned by top counter-insurgency specialists Cyril Herath and Upali Seneviratne of the ISD while still a high school student at Aquinas, I was bound to clash headlong with Vickramabahu ideologically at public forums on-and-off campus from my freshman year. I did, discovering that beneath his ideological cult-leader status, Bahu was lively, open, ebullient, with a mischievous glint, never failing to put his arm around my shoulder and wisecrack slyly even after the most heated public polemic.",
    "On a 3AM bus (we were both headed for political discussions) he impishly said I had become a \u2018tough-minded\u2019 Stalinist because my father Mervyn was a Westernised liberal-democrat. Again, seated across in a railway carriage he observed that for a Stalinist I looked quite a bit like Leon Trotsky, and would come to regard the latter with sympathy and empathy as I grew old. He was prophetic.",
    "Bahu teamed up with Vasudeva Nanayakkara to take the LSSP\u2019s leftwing caucus through a series of intermediate phases and name-variations (starting with \u2018Vaama Samasamaajaya\u2019), into a vibrant new party (NSSP) which Prof Kumar David used to brag had the highest number of PhDs of any party in the country.",
    "Eventually the NSSP flopped and was reduced to irrelevance, because in trying to avoid a ghost, it fell into an abyss which was a limbo. Vickramabahu was haunted not only by the LSSP\u2019s 1964 treacherous decision to ally with the SLFP under the latter\u2019s leadership, but also by the political irrelevance of various splinter groups led by Bala Tampoe and Edmund Samarakkody that split from the LSSP in rebellion. Bahu insisted that the radicals should not exit the LSSP \u2018prematurely\u2019 because doing so would cut them off from the party\u2019s organised working-class base.",
    "Having been haunted by \u2018premature\u2019 exit, when Bahu and comrades finally exited or were expelled, it was far too late: the LSSP and anyone who had stayed in it for however noble a reason, had been utterly rejected by the citizen-voters including the working class, culminating in the UNP landslide of 1977. As I had argued on campus with Bahu and Vasu, they and their counterparts led by Sarath Muttetuwegama in the Communist Party should have quit the Government in 1972/3.",
    "The NSSP and Bahu slowly became extinct in the decades that followed, becoming a \u2018one trick pony\u2019 limited to an anti-war and anti-racist role. Why then do I speak about his \u2018validation\u2019? Because he left behind a single strategic concept that came to life dramatically.",
    "Those of us who belonged to the post-1971 radical Left which emerged undaunted by the horrible repression and had studied the JVP\u2019s errors, were intensely debating an array of international experiences and strategies of revolution. Vickramabahu however, proffered his own, very different formula: Jana Aragalaya (\u2018People\u2019s Struggle\u2019), derived from the Hartal uprising of August 1953. We future underground activists and PTA indictees of the 1980s thought it too tame\u2014and too reliant on mass spontaneity. But it came true.",
    "The Jana Aragalaya actually erupted in 2022 and was as successful and as self-limiting as its forerunner, Hartal\u201953.",
    "Bahu\u2019s idea is the embryo of the strategic doctrine of the JVP breakaway Frontline Socialist Party (FSP), originally named \u2018Jana Aragala Vyapaaraya\u2019, whose new front is \u2018Jana Aragala Sandhaanaya\u2019.",
    "At the highest point of social consciousness, when the battle-cry \u201cAragalayata Jayawewa!\u201d rang out across Galle Face Green with massive unarmed crowds storming the Presidential Secretariat and the President\u2019s House, Bahu\u2019s consciousness had dimmed to a flicker. The \u2018Dialectics of Nature\u2019 (Engels) had taken him too far into physical and mental infirmity to be present or articulate support. Life and history intertwined, and twinned his triumph and tragedy."
