    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing the gathering after talking oaths as the ninth president",
    "In a bizarre turn of events former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u00a0 helped the JVP through his fertilizer fiasco",
    "The JVP\u2019s\u00a0 zealous anti- corruption campaign was eagerly lapped up by a vast\u00a0 number of people",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s electoral success was primarily due to the strategy he adopted\u00a0 when Sri Lanka faced an economic crisis and experienced a mass protest described as the Aragalaya or struggle",
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and\u00a0 the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u00a0 contested the 2019\u00a0 presidential election under the compass symbol. He finished a poor third with 418,553(3.16%) votes. Anura refused to be cowed down by that crushing defeat. AKD\u00a0 refurbished his image\u00a0 and re-invented the political approach of his party.",
    "This enabled Anura to spearhead\u00a0 a commendable political renaissance of the JVP led NPP. As is well known, Anura Kumara Dissanayake finished first in\u00a0 the presidential election held on 21 September 2024. Politically, it was a gigantic quantum leap. AKD polled 5,634,915 (42.31%) votes on the first count and 5,740,179 (55.89%) on the second count. It was truly a famous victory!",
    "The\u00a0 fascinating story of Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s remarkable rise\u00a0 in politics has been narrated\u00a0 in\u00a0 detail by me\u00a0 in this\u00a0 extended article of multiple parts published in the \u201cDaily Mirror\u201d. The article is essentially about\u00a0 the re-birth\u00a0 and growth\u00a0 of the JVP after\u00a0 Rohana Wijeweera,\u00a0 the steady rise\u00a0 of AKD within\u00a0 JVP folds and the transformation of the sectarian JVP into a more inclusive NPP. In this final part, the focus would be on how AKD contesting under the compass symbol won the 2024 presidential race.",
    "How then did AKD make this quantum leap through which he increased his votes fourteen-fold from 3% to 42%? A preliminary survey indicates that about 80% of the votes cast for Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the 2019 presidential election were cast this time for Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Around 15% of the 69 lakhs of Gota votes went to Ranil while the remainder was shared by Namal Rajapaksa and Dilith Jayaweera. With the wisdom of hindsight it seems clear that AKD\u00a0 had been\u00a0 mainly targeting\u00a0 Gota\u2019s voters in the poll\u00a0 without overtly appearing to be doing so.",
    "The rest of AKD\u2019s votes came from two sectors. He seems to have got the majority of the youth vote especially the first time voters. The other sector was\u00a0 the Tamil and Muslim votes. Although Sajith Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe together polled much more than AKD in the districts of the North and East and up country, Anura too increased his vote tally significantly in the districts where minority ethnicities\u00a0 are concentrated in 2024 when compared to 2019.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s \u2019s electoral success was primarily due to the strategy he adopted\u00a0 when Sri Lanka faced an economic crisis and experienced a mass protest described as the Aragalaya or struggle. Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 took over the presidency\u00a0 when the country was facing an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "Both the Jathika Jana Balawegaya\u00a0 as well as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya\u00a0 \u00a0faced a dicey\u00a0 situation when\u00a0 the then\u00a0 president Ranil Wickremesinghe kept on inviting the opposition to cooperate with his govt in the national interest and help overcome the unprecedented economic crisis through a combined effort. Declining such an invitation and adopting a hostile, non -cooperative approach may not have gone down well with the people. They may have been criticised for not putting country above party in a crisis situation.",
    "Both the SJB and JVP/NPP navigated themselves out of this\u00a0 tricky situation by downplaying the seriousness of the economic crisis. Instead they began accusing Wickremesinghe of being a Rajapaksa puppet. They reduced the situation from the sublime to the ridiculous. Instead of the need to cope with the economic challenge, the chief opposition parties, side-tracked\u00a0 the issue into that of dealing with alleged Rajapaksa robbery and corruption. They refused to\u00a0 support Ranil on the grounds that he was only propping up the Rajapaksas and protecting the Medamulana clan\u00a0 from being punished. The fact that Wickremesinghe had been elected mainly due to support by SLPP parliamentarians and depended on them\u00a0 to legislate in Parliament\u00a0 further bolstered the opposition stance.",
    "A serious political blunder by Sajith Premadasa enabled Anura Kumara Dissanayake to get the better of the then\u00a0 leader of the opposition. Having taken up the position that the SLPP led by the Rajapaksas was corrupt and had to be shunned, the JVP-NPP stayed\u00a0 firm on that count. The party refused to align in any way with the SLPP or those MPs who had quit the pohottuwa and declared themselves independent. When a group led by Dullas Alahapperuma wanted to join the NPP, Anura shut the compass door on their faces.",
    "Sajith on the other hand welcomed the\u00a0 political renegades of the SLPP into SJB folds. Several SLPP \u201cindependents\u201d were supporting Ranil. So Sajith wanted to show off by enticing SLPP crossers over too. The erstwhile SLPP chairman Prof GL Peiris became a close adviser to Premadasa. Many other ex-pohottuwa people including Alahapperuma\u00a0 gradually teamed up with Sajith.",
    "In his desire to demonstrate that the SJB too was attracting ex-SLPP parliamentarians, Sajith was accepting people who were until recently part and parcel of an allegedly corrupt party led by the Rajapaksas. It was as if corrupt sinners could receive absolution by joining the telephone camp.",
    "This\u00a0 exercise of political expediency dented\u00a0 Premadasa\u2019s political image. In contrast Anura\u2019s stock rose considerably high. The JVP/NPP was perceived as a\u00a0 principled party\u00a0 that\u00a0 did not embrace\u00a0 political renegades from a\u00a0 corrupt party. While the JVP\u2019s parliamentary strength remained at a static three, the SJB\u2019s parliamentary membership kept increasing. Support for the JVP\u00a0 went up outside Parliament where it mattered.",
    "Genuinely Against Corruption",
    "The JVP led NPP\u2019s uncompromising stance strengthened the belief that it was only the \u201cMalimawa\u201d (compass) that was genuinely against corruption\u00a0 and was seriously committed\u00a0 about bringing the Rajapaksas and their henchmen to justice.\u00a0 AKD was projected as the only person dedicated to the ideal of eradicating corruption and meting out justice to the corrupt elements plaguing the country.",
    "The JVP\u2019s\u00a0 zealous anti- corruption campaign was eagerly lapped up by a vast\u00a0 number of people. Obviously the people were angry about the prevailing corruption in almost every sphere of life and wanted it to end or at least be curtailed. However, there was another underlying\u00a0 reason too.",
    "Basically Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis was the consequence of decades of economic mismanagement. In the words of a left leaning\u00a0 Cambridge educated economist from the UK, the \u201ccountry had been eating the fruits without planting trees\u201d. The Rajapaksa regime aggravated the crisis further and helped expedite the inevitable crunch.",
    "It was President Ranil Wickremesinghe who led the country on the road to economic recovery. His approach was that of being open and honest with the people. Ranil stated\u00a0 that there was no option but to go ahead with the IMF arrangement. He said the country and people had to suffer and sacrifice in the present to pave the way for recovery and prosperity in the future. In short the people were also indirectly blamed for the crisis and were called upon to act with diligence and responsibility.",
    "The JVP/NPP led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake preferred to stay aloof and criticise the president and his government instead of cooperating with Wickremesinghe. The JVP downplayed the enormous gravity of the economic crisis. Anura even mocked Ranil saying the president was for political reasons exaggerating about the magnitude of the crisis.",
    "The stratagem adopted by AKD and the JVP/NPP was to blame\u00a0 corrupt politicians and bureaucrats in general and the Rajapaksas and those connected to them in particular for the crisis. There was no need to burden the people for the country to extricate itself from the economic morass it had sunk into. All that was required was to crack down on the rascals and retrieve the money they had systematically robbed over the years. If corruption was eradicated and culprits punished all would be well. There was no need for the people to suffer in any way.",
    "The JVP/NPP stance was welcomed by the people. AKD through his skilful oratory took this message far and wide. The people were told that all economic troubles would be over when culprits are punished and corruption ends. It is corruption that has undermined the country. If that is tackled everything would be hunky dory.",
    "AKD succeeded to a great extent in converting people to this viewpoint because it made the people feel they were not responsible in any way for the crisis. Their\u00a0 anger was directed against the corrupt elements. They were convinced that AKD had to become president for anti-corruption action to be taken.",
    "The JVP led NPP also criticised the Wickremesinghe Govt for seeking the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The left in Sri Lanka has a history of negativity towards the World Bank and IMF known as the\u00a0 \u201cBretton Woods Twins\u201d. The JVP-NPP revived that hostility. It pointed out the\u00a0 hardships the people especially the vulnerable sections of society were undergoing due to IMF conditions.",
    "AKD promised to re-negotiate with the IMF and get a better deal if elected.The JVP\u2019s economic wizard Sunil Handunnethi even stated that they would\u00a0 resolve the economic crisis\u00a0 through donations from the Sri Lankan Diaspora instead of resorting to the IMF.",
    "Once again Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 stated the true position regarding the IMF arrangement. He said that benchmarks could not be changed but a little bit of tweaking was possible in a few matters. Ranil\u2019s truths were disbelieved. Anura\u2019s untruths were believed. Though Wickremesinghe had ensured availability of essential items, affordability was an acute problem for\u00a0 most of the people (70%). Cost of living was rising but salaries were not going up. The rich were getting richer and poor getting poorer. The middle class was\u00a0 becoming extinct. In such a climate AKD\u2019s pie in the sky pledges were more attractive to the people. His electability increased.",
    "Agricultural Heartlands",
    "A major hurdle confronting the JVP\u00a0 was the historic difficulty faced in the past\u00a0 to establish itself strongly\u00a0 in\u00a0 the rural regions of Sri Lanka. The JVP was strong in the urban and semi-urban areas. The JVP\u2019s performance in previous elections showed that its support base was comparatively weak in the rural areas especially the agricultural heartlands.",
    "Furthermore the JVP has\u00a0 had in the past\u00a0 a higher percentage of membership from non-Govigama castes as opposed to the Govigama caste. The JVP does have a Govi membership (both Anura Dissanayake and Vijitha Herath have Mudiyansalage as their \u201cGe\u201d names) but it had been proportionately less than those from\u00a0 other non-Govi castes.",
    "The problem faced by the JVP in strengthening the party in the agricultural areas was solved in an unexpected way. In a bizarre turn of events former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u00a0 helped the JVP through his fertilizer fiasco. Gotabaya acting on the advice of his advisers from the Viyathmaga and Eliya banned the import of fertilizer\u00a0 thereby delivering\u00a0 a death blow to farmers and paddy cultivators. People in the rural areas especially those in the agricultural sector faced an unprecedented crisis. Many were poverty stricken.",
    "The JVP saw an opening and exploited the situation adroitly. The JVP expanded its rural front and organised\u00a0 a series of protest demonstrations in the agricultural areas. The people of these areas whose traditional occupation was agriculture\u00a0 had been SLFP supporters earlier and later supporters of the SLPP. They were essentially a vote bank of the Rajapaksas. Now they were angry with the Rajapaksas for obvious reasons.",
    "The JVP utilised this anger to its advantage by mobilising\u00a0 support in the agricultural areas.The political past became an insignificant fading memory when faced with the overwhelming\u00a0 existential reality of the present. Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara Dissanayake conquered rural Sri Lanka thanks to Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa. So much so that young monks of the Siam Nikaya engaged in propaganda for AKD at the presidential election.",
    "If AKD reaped a political harvest by utilising the woes of fertilizer deprived farmers, he received another political windfall from the winds of protest blowing over Galle Face Green. This is what I wrote of the \u201cAragalaya in a previous part of this article \u2013 \u201cMoreover\u00a0 the Aragalaya (Struggle) had accomplished many things in addition to expediting the ouster of the Rajapaksas. It had demonstrated the success of people\u2019s power in general and youth power in particular. It had enhanced aversion towards nepotism and corruption. It had also nurtured and nourished a fresh political culture clamouring for a change in the system or in the\u00a0 existing order of things.\u201d",
    "AKD\u00a0 made an incisive analysis of the changed situation with the aid of pro-JVP academics, analysts and opinion makers. He recognised that the people in general and youths in particular were yearning for a change. Some called it a system change. None seemed sure or clear about what this change was likely to be. The JVP/NPP led by AKD defined this change as a change of\u00a0 those in power from the presidency to Parliament.",
    "Thereafter the JVP led NPP began a push -pull approach. On the one hand it widely encouraged\u00a0 the yearning for change\u00a0 while on the other that yearning was channeled into a demand for political change. The JVP/NPP used the\u00a0 compass symbol as its symbol for change. Countless video\u00a0 clips promoting the Malimawa and Thisaikaatti as harbingers of change were propagated in Sinhala and Tamil\u00a0 over social media and you tubes.",
    "In the process two passions came to the fore. One was anger and hate\u00a0 against the privileged classes and those in power.\u00a0 The other was sympathy and empathy for the under-privileged and powerless people. The presidential election was going to be an undeclared war between the haves and have nots. The goal was a victory for the\u00a0 proverbial common man. AKD was projected as both a\u00a0 champion\u00a0 for change\u00a0 as well as an agent of change.",
    "AK Dissanayake fitted the bill perfectly. He had rugged good looks, an amiable disposition and a flair for effective oratory. He had a knack for establishing instant rapport with his varied audiences be it the Udarata,Rajarata, Ruhuna, Vadakku or Kizhakku. He spoke simply yet elegantly in a conversational style. He would pose questions and then proceed to answer them.",
    "There was also feeling and empathy when he spoke about the particular problems faced by segments of the people\u00a0 and their sufferings as well as their aspirations. His was a tone of sincerity coupled with the ring of authenticity. My knowledge of Sinhala is not up to the mark but\u00a0 I\u00a0 could understand much of what he said and was both touched and impressed.",
    "No wonder then that Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u00a0 romped home the winner in the presidential stakes. It was essentially due to three main factors namely a) the mobilisation of huge crowds in public meetings and rallies, b) a widespread house to house campaign by volunteers targeting households\u00a0 systematically and c) an intensive, sustained promotional campaign over social media and you tubes.",
    "This then was how Anura Kumara Dissanayake known as AKD\u00a0 became\u00a0 the ninth executive\u00a0 president of Sri Lanka. Hope springs eternal in the human breast! Let us hope therefore that AKD can usher in the change that he promised during his election campaign.",
