    "Last week, we hosted EmTech MIT, MIT Technology Review\u2019s annual flagship conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Over the course of three days of main-stage sessions, I learned about innovations in AI, biotech, and robotics.\u00a0 But as you might imagine, some of this climate reporter\u2019s favorite moments came in the climate sessions. I was listening especially closely to my colleague James Temple\u2019s discussion with Lucia Tian, head of advanced energy technologies at Google.\u00a0 Related StoryIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt usesRead next They spoke about the tech giant\u2019s growing energy demand and what sort of technologies the company is looking to to help meet it. In case you weren\u2019t able to join us, let\u2019s dig into that session and consider how the company is thinking about energy in the face of AI\u2019s rapid rise.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been closely following Google\u2019s work in energy this year. Like the rest of the tech industry, the company is seeing ballooning electricity demand in its data centers. That could get in the way of a major goal that Google has been talking about for years.",
    "See, back in 2020, the company announced an ambitious target: by 2030, it aimed to run on carbon-free energy 24-7. Basically, that means Google would purchase enough renewable energy on the grids where it operates to meet its entire electricity demand, and the purchases would match up so the electricity would have to be generated when the company was actually using energy. (For more on the nuances of Big Tech\u2019s renewable-energy pledges, check out James\u2019s piece from last year.) Google\u2019s is an ambitious goal, and on stage, Tian said that the company is still aiming for it but acknowledged that it\u2019s looking tough with the rise of AI.",
    "\u201cIt was always a moonshot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something very, very hard to achieve, and it\u2019s only harder in the face of this growth. But our perspective is, if we don\u2019t move in that direction, we\u2019ll never get there.\u201d Google\u2019s total electricity demand more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, according to its latest Environmental Report. As for that goal of 24-7 carbon-free energy? The company is basically treading water. While it was at 67% for its data centers in 2020, last year it came in at 66%.\u00a0 Not going backwards is something of an accomplishment, given the rapid growth in electricity demand. But it still leaves the company some distance away from its finish line. To close the gap, Google has been signing what feels like constant deals in the energy space. Two recent announcements that Tian talked about on stage were a project involving carbon capture and storage at a natural-gas plant in Illinois and plans to reopen a shuttered nuclear power plant in Iowa.\u00a0  Let\u2019s start with carbon capture. Google signed an agreement to purchase most of the electricity from a new natural-gas plant, which will capture and store about 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions.\u00a0 That announcement was controversial, with critics arguing that carbon capture keeps fossil-fuel infrastructure online longer and still releases greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere.\u00a0 One question that James raised on stage: Why build a new natural-gas plant rather than add equipment to an already existing facility? Tacking on equipment to an operational plant would mean cutting emissions from the status quo, rather than adding entirely new fossil-fuel infrastructure.\u00a0 The company did consider many existing plants, Tian said. But, as she put it, \u201cRetrofits aren\u2019t going to make sense everywhere.\u201d Space can be limited at existing plants, for example, and many may not have the right geology to store carbon dioxide underground.",
    "\u201cWe wanted to lead with a project that could prove this technology at scale,\u201d Tian said. This site has an operational Class VI well, the type used for permanent sequestration, she added, and it also doesn\u2019t require a big pipeline buildout.\u00a0 Related StoryCan nuclear power really fuel the rise of AI?Read nextTian also touched on the company\u2019s recent announcement that it\u2019s collaborating with NextEra Energy to reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Iowa. The company will purchase electricity from that plant, which is scheduled to reopen in 2029.\u00a0 As I covered in a story earlier this year, Duane Arnold was basically the final option in the US for companies looking to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants. \u201cJust a few years back, we were still closing down nuclear plants in this country,\u201d Tian said on stage.\u00a0 While each reopening will look a little different, Tian highlighted the groups working to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which was the first reopening to be announced, last spring. \u201cThey\u2019re the real heroes of the story,\u201d she said. I\u2019m always interested to get a peek behind the curtain at how Big Tech is thinking about energy. I\u2019m skeptical but certainly interested to see how Google\u2019s, and the rest of the industry\u2019s, goals shape up over the next few years.\u00a0 This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter.
