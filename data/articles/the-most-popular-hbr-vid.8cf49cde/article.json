    "Each yeah, HBR produces dozens of videos that cover a wide array of business and work topics, ranging from research-based business theory, to wisdom from top performers in their fields, to nitty-gritty tactics for surviving another day in an imperfect world of work....more",
    "If you were looking for ways to feel happier and more fulfilled in your job this year, you weren\u2019t alone. The question of whether work can \u2014 or even should \u2014 lead to happiness was one of two top themes that emerged when we looked at HBR\u2019s most popular 2024 videos across platforms (including HBR.org, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok). The other big theme: how to be a better communicator. If you missed any of these videos the first time around, we thought now is the perfect time to revisit them and catch up.",
    "Our first set of videos explores the truth that every striver knows, which is that workaholism will eventually wear you down and make you dread your job. A three-part video series featuring Harvard social scientist and bestselling author Arthur C. Brooks explores this dynamic and offers some ways out.",
    "Brooks posits that it\u2019s OK to think of yourself as much more than your job. And he isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, admitting in the videos that he too has suffered from self-imposed overachiever pressures, missing out on some of his family\u2019s milestones. It turns out that addiction to work (which he reframes as an addiction to success) should be taken just as seriously as other addictions we seek help for. You are more than just a \u201csuccess machine.\u201d",
    "One of Brooks\u2019 big takeaways is that finding balance may mean having to learn how to say no, and that\u2019s the subject of one of the dozens of short videos that HBR produced this year. In it, Women at Work cohosts Amy Bernstein and Amy Gallo say a big part of declining tasks confidently is to recognize that it\u2019s often in the company\u2019s and your team\u2019s best interest for you to focus more intently on fewer things.",
    "Other popular shorts offered bite-sized wisdom on work happiness, including this one-minute coaching session on battling burnout from Muriel Wilkins, host of Coaching Real Leaders; a short by senior editor Paige Cohen (who stars in dozens of HBR shorts) on the life-altering power of gratitude; and a short by HBR contributor Ashley Goodall on how creating stability is just as important as managing change. (An organization that isn\u2019t constantly transforming itself leads to happier and more engaged employees, it turns out.)",
    "Our most popular video of the year blends a core management concept \u2014 strategy \u2014 with our pursuit of balance and happiness. Instead of drawing from other fields like psychology or philosophy to help us find happiness at work, \u201cUse Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want\u201d shows you how to apply a key business idea to the bigger picture of your life. Experts from Boston Consulting Group lay out how an approach inspired by corporate strategizing can help you create a \u201clife portfolio\u201d that is diversified, meaningful, and satisfying. In a healthy portfolio, work is just one piece amongst many others including personal connections, hobbies, and your community.",
    "On the less existential end of the spectrum, communication was top-of-mind for many viewers. One of our most popular YouTube videos was a guide to getting people to listen to you, by contributing editor Amy Gallo, a complement to 2022\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Active Listening.\u201d",
    "Another top performer was on the concept of \u201ccommander\u2019s intent\u201d, borrowed from the U.S. military and explained by retired U.S. Army Colonel and Harvard Business School lecturer Hise O. Gibson. Commander\u2019s intent involves being very direct about expectations and leads to more accountability both up and down the chain of command.",
    "Several HBR shorts touched upon communication, as well: Muriel Wilkins shared one-minute coaching sessions for those who might feel they\u2019re too assertive at work, or not assertive enough. My colleague Paige Cohen produced several popular communication pieces, that look at the science behind strong writing, negotiating, and how to explain to a potential employer why they should hire you. And HBR author Chip Conley highlights the importance of more experienced employees passing on their wisdom to younger generations of coworkers.",
    "Finally, an honorable mention to our top video from 2023, also on communication and also the second most popular for 2024: \u201cHow to Get Good at Small Talk, and Even Enjoy It\u201d. One key takeaway, which seems to cover a lot of the advice from our other top videos: communication is about connection, not perfection.",
