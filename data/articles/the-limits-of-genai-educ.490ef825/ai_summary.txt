1. 🖥️ Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT 4, have been hailed by some experts as the future of education.
2. ❗ However, more than 40 years of research suggests generative AI could harm learning in realms from online tutoring to employee training.
3. 🧡 Research emphasizes that a strong empathetic learner-teacher relationship has 2.5x greater impact than individualized instruction.
4. ❌ As algorithms cannot foster empathetic relationships due to lack of human brain and emotions, the efficiency of AI-driven teaching is questionable.
5. 📘 While AI can help learners access broad information, the process of internalizing knowledge is crucial for problem-solving and creative thinking.
6. ⚠️ Relying on AI for teaching could expose learners to unvetted, incorrect, or irrelevant information, which could derail learning.
7. 👩‍🏫 Trusting experts to vet and organize key information remains invaluable in the learning process.
8. 🎭 Multitasking (common with digital devices) has been proven to harm learning by decreasing accuracy, speed, memory formation, and enjoyment.
9. 💪 Generative AI may prove beneficial in cognitive offloading (managing basic tasks), but only for experienced learners or experts, who have the necessary deep knowledge.
10. 🏛️ Over-reliance on AI for education risks the potential loss of key elements of the learning process. Unique human aspects of teaching and learning cannot be fully replaced by algorithmic systems.
