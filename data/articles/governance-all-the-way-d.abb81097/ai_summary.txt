Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) senior economist Peter Doyle critiqued IMF's medium-term primary surplus targets for countries like Sri Lanka during a webinar on 22 May. He suggested that these targets prioritise clearing existing debts over new investments and growth promotion within the country. Doyle stressed the urgent need to re-focus on growth. The establishment in Sri Lanka has sought to attribute the country's issues to poor governance and corruption, although Doyle argued this wrongly places responsibility on debtor nations and overlooks the role and actions of lenders. He also noted that labelling governance as the problem avoids addressing structural issues inhibiting fair resolution and that austerity is currently the principal extraction method.
