    "Your digital footprint and online activities can have a big effect on how attractive and visible you are to potential employers. How do you notify your network about your job search without sounding too desperate or needy? And if you\u2019re currently employed, how do you...more",
    "Your social media presence can make or break your job search. Tapping into your network\u2019s connections and ideas can give you an edge, but it\u2019s critical to be savvy and maintain professionalism. So, how do you post about your job search without appearing desperate? What\u2019s the best way to showcase your skills to ensure your contacts think of you for opportunities? If you\u2019re currently employed, how can you subtly signal you\u2019re open to a new job without raising red flags at work? And if you\u2019re a new grad just entering the working world, where do you even start?",
    "The traditional hiring model is shifting towards a more targeted approach. \u201cOrganizations are no longer waiting around for candidates to apply to jobs,\u201d says Matti Laukkarinen, doctoral researcher at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Finland. \u201cInstead, they\u2019re proactively recruiting and headhunting talent online using social media platforms and predictive analytics.\u201d The implications for jobseekers are profound: Your digital footprint and online activities can have a big effect on how attractive and visible you are to potential employers. That\u2019s why, when you\u2019re searching for a new role, it\u2019s important to strategically manage your presence on social media, according to Lisa Orb\u00e9-Austin, a psychologist, executive coach, and coauthor of Own Your Greatness. The objective is to \u201cthink like a social media manager and curate\u201d a professional, engaging, and tailored profile that resonates with target employers. Here are some tips on how to do that.",
    "Before starting your job search, a digital spring cleaning is necessary. \u201cWith AI tools, recruiters can data-mine everything,\u201d warns Laukkarinen, which means that you need to take extra precautions to ensure potential employers see only what you want them to. To protect yourself from bias and discrimination, review your public accounts and remove any sensitive information, such as your relationship or disability status. Make your personal social media accounts private, and be deliberate about everything you post. (More on that below.) \u201cI advise clients to scrub their socials of any personal information,\u201d says Orb\u00e9-Austin. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Do I want an employer knowing this about me?\u2019 Because if you\u2019re using your real name, it\u2019s discoverable.\u201d What you share online can work both for and against you, she adds. \u201cAnd the world is a small place.\u201d",
    "Optimize your profile",
    "Next, focus on increasing your visibility to potential employers by optimizing your profile on LinkedIn and other networking sites. The key is to strike a balance that appeals to both recruiters and algorithms, according to Laukkarinen. In other words, it should highlight your experience and expertise in a way that\u2019s \u201caccessible to humans, but straightforward enough for a machine to interpret.\u201d To achieve this, he recommends analyzing job postings from your target companies and incorporating matching keywords into your profile and summary. Orb\u00e9-Austin notes that as your career advances, your approach to your profile should adapt. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you give more detail about your jobs and responsibilities,\u201d she says. As you progress, your profile should become more streamlined and \u201cfeature job titles, a strong summary of your accomplishments, and relevant keywords,\u201d she says.",
    "Developing your professional network on social media is a process that you\u2019ll refine over the course of your career, not just during active job searches. Laukkarinen\u2019s research highlights the importance of both quantity and quality: a larger number of contacts increases your visibility to potential employers by amplifying your searchability through search and recommendation tools, while strong interpersonal connections are more likely to endorse you when opportunities arise. Orb\u00e9-Austin advises job market newcomers to make use of LinkedIn\u2019s networking capabilities during job searches. \u201cLinkedIn is where you reach out to anyone under the sun with whom you are remotely associated,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a platform to link up with people like, say, your friends\u2019 parents \u2014 a concept that might be unimaginable on Instagram or TikTok \u2014 who are likely well-connected and can provide insights and potential leads. Studies show that these \u201cweak ties,\u201d casual relationships, occasional social encounters, or friends of friends, are the key to unlocking job opportunities.",
    "Craft a compelling narrative",
    "Announcing your job search on social media is a popular and efficient way to involve your network in helping you find new opportunities. Orb\u00e9-Austin recommends customizing your message based on your career stage for maximum impact. \u201cDevelop a curating mindset,\u201d she says, and consider two essential questions: \u201cWhat audience am I trying to reach?\u201d and \u201cWhat message am I sending?\u201d Here are a few suggestions, based on the career stage you\u2019re in:",
    "If you\u2019re a new graduate: Include your degree, special skills, accomplishments, and preferred job types. Strike a balance between specificity and openness to various opportunities. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be too narrow or niche,\u201d notes Orb\u00e9-Austin. Express humility and ask for guidance, using phrases like, \u201cI\u2019m open to advice and suggestions, so please DM me if you know of any openings.\u201d Young applicants often receive support when they\u2019re looking for their first or second jobs as \u201cpeople have a lot of empathy for that stage of life,\u201d she says.",
    "If you were just laid-off: Maintain professionalism and focus on your career goals rather than dwelling on the past. The post should be free of raw emotions and bitterness toward your former employer. Instead, highlight your skills, accomplishments, and the types of opportunities you\u2019re seeking. Be cautious with features like LinkedIn\u2019s \u201copen to work\u201d banner, as it may unintentionally convey desperation, says Orb\u00e9-Austin. \u201cIf you\u2019re on LinkedIn, you\u2019re open to new opportunities,\u201d which makes the banner unnecessary. \u201cIt pretty much just says: Unemployed.\u201d",
    "If you\u2019re actively looking, but you don\u2019t want your boss to know: Be discreet and don\u2019t publicly post about your search. Instead, Orb\u00e9-Austin suggests maintaining confidentiality by adjusting your LinkedIn settings to notify recruiters that you\u2019re looking without making it visible to your current employer. This way, when recruiters perform searches, they can filter candidates based on availability. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to signal on the back-end that you\u2019re open to opportunities,\u201d she says. If you prefer to play it safe, Laukkarinen recommends the old-fashioned route of reaching out to your network offline. \u201cThat way, there\u2019s no paper trail,\u201d he says.",
    "If you\u2019re mid-career: A post may be useful in some cases, but Orb\u00e9-Austin recommends directly messaging key contacts or creating smaller audience groups for tailored announcements. Instagram, for instance, allows you to form targeted subgroups within your network for those most likely to assist your job search. Networking and reconnecting with former colleagues and bosses through social media might feel daunting, but \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate,\u201d says Orb\u00e9-Austin. Reach out with a genuine message that compliments their achievements and expresses interest in talking about your job search. \u201cDo it in a relational way and without any shame,\u201d she says.",
    "A singular post about your job search is a fine start, but the point of social media is to be, well, social. Posting consistently \u2014 at least weekly \u2014 will keep your network informed about and invested in your job search, says Orb\u00e9-Austin. Your posts should create interest and spark conversation. \u201cThe more engagement you get on a post, the better the reach it will have.\u201d Ask questions about your field and industry and encourage dialogue. Share updates on your activities, accomplishments, and perspectives on relevant topics. Maybe you were on a panel, or are taking an online class. \u201cPeople want to see things that are personal and offer a window into the world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd your network will enjoy celebrating your wins.\u201d Be sure to engage with others\u2019 content, too. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to build a community; be communal.\u201d",
    "Be mindful of your tone",
    "Seeing others vent on social media about job search struggles or company interview processes may tempt you to publicly share your own frustrations. But don\u2019t. You need to be mindful of your tone and how potential employers may perceive your posts, says Orb\u00e9-Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to be honest and talk about hard things, but frame it around what you\u2019re learning and how you\u2019re growing,\u201d she says. Strive to come across as optimistic and upbeat and showcase your resilience in overcoming obstacles. No angry tirades or rants. \u201cIf you go out there guns blazing, there can be severe long-term consequences,\u201d she says. Laukkarinen concurs, pointing to research that suggests recruiters respond unfavorably to potentially damaging content. \u201cWhen recruiters screen candidates through social media, even small red flags can have large outcomes,\u201d he says.",
    "Sustain your social media presence",
    "Many people neglect their social media presence after securing a job, according to Orb\u00e9-Austin. However, staying active on platforms like LinkedIn can showcase your professional growth and keep your network engaged. Sharing work updates and accomplishments, such as new projects, initiatives, or promotions, not only demonstrates your value to your organization but might also capture the attention of potential hiring managers. An added bonus: You\u2019re sharing about your company, so your employer appreciates it. \u201cIt may look as though you\u2019re simply posting about your day-to-day work, but it\u2019s interesting to recruiters and it\u2019s creating a record of your accomplishments.\u201d Which will be helpful when you\u2019re looking for your next new job.",
