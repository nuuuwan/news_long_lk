Your digital footprint can greatly influence your attractiveness to potential employers, and a strategic approach to social media presence can herald professional opportunities. Organisations are increasingly recruiting primarily through social media and predictive analytics. As such, job seekers should manage their online presence carefully, keeping personal social media accounts private and focusing on presenting a professional image. LinkedIn profiles should be optimised for both recruiters and algorithms, featuring relevant keywords and details of experience and expertise. Networking should be consistent, not just during job searches. The network's size boosts visibility to employers and a higher number of interpersonal connections is likely to yield endorsements. Sharing an engaging and regular stream of content keeps one's network informed and involved in job searches. Most importantly, maintaining a positive and optimistic tone, even when discussing challenges, is essential. The digital presence should be sustained even after securing a job, keeping the network engaged and potentially attracting future opportunities.
