    "Disruption to the upward trend",
    "From 2010 to 2019 the number of outbound Chinese students grew at an average annual rate of 9.5%, making the country the biggest source of international students globally. However, this rapid growth was disrupted by the pandemic that emerged in 2020. The\u00a0virus (and China\u2019s subsequent restrictive policy) caused profound damage to the country\u2019s student mobility.\u00a0The\u00a0number of outbound students plummeted by 36% year on year in 2020,\u00a0according to a report by the Centre for China and Globalisation (CCG), a\u00a0think\u2011tank.",
    "Although the number of outbound students has been climbing after the initial hit from the pandemic, it\u00a0remains well below the potential trend that would have manifested had the pandemic not occurred.\u00a0In the meantime, the picture of overall international study is increasingly shaped by the challenges that China faces in the course of development, which include the country\u2019s slowing pace of economic growth, a more unfavourable demographic structure and evolving complexity in China\u2019s relationship with other\u00a0countries.",
    "EIU believes that all of these factors will significantly affect China\u2019s outbound study market, leading to much slower growth in the overall number of outbound students.\u00a0It\u00a0is crucial for countries with large exposure to\u00a0education revenue from international Chinese students to be aware of and to prepare for the upcoming\u00a0challenges.",
    "Challenges arise from growing geopolitical tensions",
    "After China reopened its borders following the covid-19 pandemic, most Western countries (excluding the UK) faced a decrease in the number of Chinese students.\u00a0This\u00a0decline is not solely attributable to decisions made by individual students, but primarily reflects the dynamic in China\u2019s diplomatic relations with these\u00a0countries.",
    "The increasing uncertainty of obtaining a student visa could strongly dampen Chinese students\u2019 willingness to study in the US. Despite being the most popular destination for Chinese students,\u00a0the\u00a0US has recorded the largest decrease in the number of inbound students from China since 2020, when the pandemic emerged and Proclamation 10043 took effect, barring the entry of Chinese students who have any association with the Chinese military. The\u00a0US rejected 36% of Chinese student visa applicants in 2023\u2014a\u00a0record high. If\u00a0Donald Trump is\u00a0re\u2011elected\u00a0as US president, we expect the issuance of student visas to Chinese applicants to decline more\u00a0quickly.",
    "Meanwhile,\u00a0escalating tensions between the US and China are mirrored in increasing mutual animosity among the general public in both countries.\u00a0 A\u00a0Pew survey conducted in 2021 shows that more than 50% of Americans support limiting Chinese students in the US, while 68% of Chinese hold negative views about the US, according to an academic paper released in 2022. This\u00a0has inevitably further damaged student flows between the two\u00a0countries.",
    "Some countries that are allies of the US\u00a0impose restrictions on Chinese student visa applicants, particularly for those who wish to study in sensitive fields, to control technology exports\u00a0amid the current wave of \u201cdecoupling\u201d; these countries, which act either implicitly or explicitly, include Australia, the\u00a0UK and Canada. This development will continue to weigh on the overall growth of China\u2019s student mobility to these\u00a0countries.",
    "Nonetheless,\u00a0the continuous increase in the number of Chinese students going to the UK largely reflects a diversion of students who are unable to secure visas to study in the US.\u00a0Demand for study in a\u00a0major English-speaking country with several prestigious universities remains substantial. In\u00a0addition,\u00a0the restoration in 2019 of the graduate visa\u00a0has significantly boosted the appeal of the UK to Chinese\u00a0students; this allows students to stay in the UK for two years after they complete their course.",
    "Rapid shifts in the domestic environment",
    "Besides changes in the external environment,\u00a0 China\u2019s economy and society have also experienced a transition.\u00a0These shifts may not play out to be the primary factor that alters the landscape of overseas Chinese study, but we expect them to become more crucial in the future development of student\u00a0mobility.",
    "The benefits of education in the students\u2019 home country have been growing.\u00a0The\u00a0quality of Chinese academic institutes has improved over the past decade, on the back of rapid economic growth and substantial government support. China\u2019s top universities are achieving a higher standing in various global rankings. Besides the quality of education, universities also provide a place for students to cultivate personal networks and gain support.\u00a0Chinese students returning after completing an overseas course have often found that they lack a well-established local network of contacts, which has become increasingly important to landing a job or setting up a new business, especially during a period of economic downturn.",
    "Studying abroad hardly provides an edge in China\u2019s labour market at the moment.\u00a0The\u00a0allure of overseas study derives principally from the ability to secure a higher income through a foreign education. However, this has become less true over the years, as the actual average income of those who have overseas experience has been declining. In\u00a0addition, students who return\u00a0to China tend to find work in sectors such as information technology and finance, which have been facing crackdowns from the Chinese authorities in recent years, considerably limiting their wage growth. Chinese students may also avoid overseas experience if they want to get into the civil service system, amid the intensifying anti-espionage movement in\u00a0China.",
    "Demographic changes will be the main drag in the future.\u00a0One\u00a0factor that has been supporting the growth of China\u2019s outbound study is the intense competition in university entrance examinations. However, China\u2019s population is\u00a0shrinking, and the school-age population is expected to contract rapidly in the future. This will not only narrow the pool of potential overseas students but also ease significantly the magnitude of competition in tertiary education in China, further undercutting the incentive to study\u00a0abroad.",
    "The changes provide opportunities",
    "There has been rapid growth in the number of students from South and South-east Asia.\u00a0The\u00a0declining enrolment of students from China in many countries has been compensated for by a surge in Indian students. For\u00a0example, the number of student visas issued by the US to Indian applicants has exceeded those granted to China since 2022.\u00a0Meanwhile, growth in the number of students from\u00a0South-east Asian countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines has also been robust in some popular destinations for overseas study.\u00a0We\u00a0expect the rapid growth of students from South and South-east Asian countries to be sustained, as economic growth in these countries remains relatively\u00a0strong.",
    "Schools in Asia are gaining in popularity among Chinese students.\u00a0Given that China\u2019s\u00a0outbound investment\u00a0is increasingly flowing into other parts of Asia, the friendly admission requirements and lower tuition fees of schools in the region will attract more Chinese students. Relatively high-quality international schools (compared with the ones in China) that offer K\u201112 education (from kindergarten through to the end of high school) in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia also attract Chinese families. We\u00a0expect this trend to continue as Chinese households become richer in the\u00a0future.",
    "Personal interest plays a more important role.\u00a0A\u00a0notable shift is occurring among Chinese outbound students, who are demonstrating a growing preference for courses that cater to their interests and aspirations, as opposed to traditional career-oriented paths. For\u00a0example, about 40% of Chinese students in France have been enrolled in humanities, arts and linguistics studies in recent years. As\u00a0these programmes do not aim to elevate students\u2019 competitiveness in the labour market, Chinese students will prefer shorter and more focused programmes. Setting up short programmes, such as summer schools, that focus on cultivating individual interests will attract Chinese\u00a0students.",
