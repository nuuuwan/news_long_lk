I was delighted to be there when the book titled “Essentials of Modern Marketing” was launched recently. The key role played by Denzil Indrajith Perera, one of my MBA “learning partners”, in this regard, was indeed commendable. As a “non-marketer”, I enjoyed reading it and as a case-writer I saw the richness in it. Today’s column is an exploration of such essentials.

The “‘Essentials of Modern Marketing (EOMM)” is a flagship marketing series by the “Knight of Marketing”, Prof. Philip Kotler. The Sri Lankan edition of it was officially launched in cooperation with Kotler Impact Inc. and Deyo Consultancy and Advisory, recently. As one solid step in Kotler’s series of country specific editions, 22 Sri Lankan cases have been included in this valued volume. According to Denzil who represents Kotler Impact in Sri Lanka and Maldives, this is a sure showcasing of 22 local brands in the global arena with needed recognition.

I, being a “non-marketer” see the value of this volume in multiple ways. It goes beyond the brand stories highlighting the caveats of case-based learning. Having co-authored a case-study collection titled, “PIM Cases in Management”, I saw the richness of a case in its resourceful nature of linking pertinent practices to profound theories. Denzil and his team have done the justice for 22 local brands in clearly and cleverly connecting them to apt marketing concepts.

As it is widely known, a case is an issue, or a theme centred description. It may contain a core issue/theme and peripheral issues/sub-themes. Such a case typically involves individuals, interactive teams and institutions alike. It also includes recommendations to solve key issues/sustaining success, etc. showing an effective way of learning by drawing insights. It may also include an analysis of a real-world business situation to develop solutions, outlining the practical execution plans for delivering and managing a project or initiative, including risks, monitoring, and governance.

Management cases provide learners who pursue business studies such as MBAs with scenarios to develop essential managerial competencies. This is by way of analysing real-world business problems, enhancing critical thinking, decision-making, and communication skills. The case method immerses learners in complex situations, prompting them to evaluate options, ask critical questions, and work through problems from multiple angles, ultimately preparing them to make sound judgments and formulate robust strategies in their future careers.

A marketing case in particular, is a detailed, real-world story about how a business solved a problem or achieved a specific goal using a particular product, service, or strategy, highlighting the challenges, solutions, and quantifiable results. This is what Kotler Impact and Denzil have presented to Sri Lankan readers.

Kotler Impact in action

According to the published details, the Kotler Impact is a strategic marketing community seeking to employ sustainable economic development. Headquartered in Canada, it believes in a generation that is sustainable, evolutionary, and transformable. This will be achieved through the accumulation of marketplace diversity, the implementation of fundamental, educational resources, and the commitment of business and professional leaders who strive for excellence.

The presence of Kotler Impact in Sri Lanka was immensely felt when they organised the inaugural “National Marketing Day” in Sri Lanka on 27 May 2022, coinciding with the birthday of Professor Philip Kotler, widely known as the “Father of Modern Marketing”. For the second time, such an event was held this year, and it was very encouraging to see him appearing live via Zoom in addressing the virtual gathering at PIM to wish him for his 94th birthday.

Philip Kotler’s latest marketing thoughts emphasise a “higher purpose” for marketing, moving beyond profit to focus on sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and ethical practices that improve society and the planet. He highlights a market shifted to the empowered consumer, requiring a shift from directing to “connecting and collaborating” through dialogue, authentic experiences, and long-term relationships, not just transactional sales. Key elements include digital integration, the creation of “winning brands” through consumer perception, and the importance of innovation and customer loyalty to meet rapidly changing market needs.

At the launch, Kotler Impact CEO Sadia Kibria described marketing as more than a business tool, calling it “a catalyst for positive social change” that, when applied with wisdom and integrity, can create value and solve real-world problems. She praised Sri Lanka’s vibrant entrepreneurial culture, its resilient spirit, and the creativity of its people, declaring that the country was ready to welcome not only global corporations but also bold start-ups and innovators. Sadia also stated how the book’s global journey began, with its first launch in Italy in 2021, followed by editions in several other countries. With plans to publish 45 editions worldwide featuring more than 700 brands, she congratulated the 22 Sri Lankan brands that are included in this vibrant edition.

As Kotler Impact states, EOMM is not only about marketing and selling a product or service. It is about finding and building a future using the new tools of modern marketing. This book can lead one’s organisation to discover new talents, capabilities, and opportunities. It deals with modern marketing in such a way that covers as few pages and is as accessible as possible, while communicating the fundamental, most important theoretical aspects and facilitating the transfer of this knowledge to real-life decision situations. It concentrates on the essential marketing know-how for both, practitioners and learners worldwide.

As we observe, most marketing textbooks deal exclusively with the operational aspect of marketing or the strategic part. The speciality of EOMM is that it not only integrates all relevant aspects of marketing but also structures them in such a way, that both practitioners and learners acquire a comprehensive and holistic overview, how it all fits together. This is mostly achieved by the structure of the book which follows the marketing planning and decision-making process inside the enterprise.

Writing a preface to EOMM, Prof. Philip Kotler highlights the world beyond COVID-19. “Due to COVID-19 and other uncertainties, all industries and businesses are challenged. In addition, organisations and companies alike are having to deal with constant change and mega trends such as digitisation and disruption which calls for continuous innovation and change and tough decisions on staffing, procurement, finance and marketing. You need to think ahead on how to find new markets, create new marketing strategies, innovate new products and build new partnerships.”

Further in his preface, Kotler refers to Peter Drucker, the iconic management thinker. “Remember Peter Drucker’s emphasis on marketing and innovation as the fundamental crafts of a winning company. When you are disrupted. Do not give up. Never stop.”

Showcasing Sri Lankan organisations

“The journey culminating in the book you hold was indeed a “tall task”, assigned to many yet demanding extraordinary dedication to bring to fruition. It is a testament to collective effort and shared vision.” That’s how Denzil appreciates the team that worked tirelessly. Prof. Nalin Absekera, former Dean of the Faculty of Management Science, Open University of Sri Lanka has been one such pillar of strength.

When perusing the book, one can find the Sri Lankan cases each linked to an essential marketing concept. In the way the book has presented sequentially, one can see SLIIT, Rokland, BNS, CIRP, Derena, Nine Wells, Cinnamon Grand, Sunquick, Insee Cement, Colombo Gin, Ceylinco Life Insurance, Watawala Tea, Prime Group, Sampath Bank, Clogard (Oral Care), Macktiles, Olu Water, Power Hands Plantation, Sanasa, Lady J, Sri Lanka Cricket and Ampark Foundation. It was interesting to see how the entrepreneurial journey of Bathiya and Santhush (BNS) has been meaningfully linked to essentials of modern marketing.

“Analyse how “Wasanthaye” by BNS was a strategic response to the Sri Lankan music market of fragmented nature of 1998.” This is the first associated question regards to the BNS case. A teacher’s note is provided highlighting the three market segments BNS had identified. How their approach is linked to Ansoff’s product-market matrix is insightful.

I, being someone transitioned from an “engineer of electrical to an engineer of hearts and minds” enjoyed reading the EOMM as a non-marketer”. I still recall how we learnt the Kotler’s definition of marketing during the MBA times. His early definitions focused on “human activity directed at satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process”. More recent definitions of Kotler highlight the importance of “creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and managing customer relationships in a way that benefits the organisation”.

How can I forget my mentor, late Prof. Uditha Liyange, the most prolific marketer of Sri Lanka, who co-chaired a local event with Prof. Philip Kotler? “The challenge of today’s marketer is to sense the emerging postmodernist propensities of the emerging consumer and develop propositions and products that avoid the two extremes of being either overly traditionalist or modernist,” said Prof. Liyanage. It is encouraging to see Dr. Asanga Ranasinghe, Director, PIM and many others contributing immensely to uplift marketing profession in Sri Lanka which is a timely need.

I as a “non-marketer” see the need to embrace the “essentials of modern marketing”, by all managers. There is a pivotal role awaiting professional bodies such as Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), Chartered Institute of Management (CIM) – Sri Lanka Chapter to do together with Marketing departments of all management faculties representing both state and non-state higher education institutions, and of course with the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM). Fragmentation will not be fruitful for the fraternity. The brand “Sri Lanka” needs to be boosted by bountiful Sri Lankan brands with brilliance.
