    "Since the Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui was released from prison in 2022, he has sought to make a scientific comeback and to repair his reputation after a three-year incarceration for illegally creating the world\u2019s first gene-edited children.\u00a0 While he has bounced between cities, jobs, and meetings with investors, one area of visible success on his comeback trail has been his X.com account, @Jiankui_He, which has become his main way of spreading his ideas to the world. Starting in September 2022, when he joined the platform, the account stuck to the scientist\u2019s main themes, including promising a more careful approach to his dream of creating more gene-edited children. \u201cI will do it, only after society has accepted it,\u201d he posted in August 2024. He also shared mundane images of his daily life, including golf games and his family.  But over time, it evolved and started to go viral. First came a series of selfies accompanied by grandiose statements (\u201cEvery pioneer or prophet must suffer\u201d). Then, in April of this year, it became particularly outrageous and even troll-like, blasting out bizarre messages (\u201cGood morning bitches. How many embryos have you gene edited today?\u201d). This has left observers unsure what to take seriously. Last month, in reply to MIT Technology Review\u2019s questions about who was responsible for the account\u2019s transformation into a font of clever memes, He emailed us back: \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Cathy Tie.\u201d",
    "You may not be familiar with Tie, but she\u2019s no stranger to the public spotlight. A former Thiel fellow, she is a partner in the attention-grabbing Los Angeles Project, which promised to create glow-in-the-dark pets. Over the past several weeks, though, the 29-year-old Canadian entrepreneur has started to get more and more attention as the new wife to (and apparent social media mastermind behind) He Jiankui. On April 15, He announced a new venture, Cathy Medicine, that would take up his mission of editing human embryos to create people resistant to diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s or cancer. Just a few days later, on April 18, He and Tie announced that they had married, posting pictures of themselves in traditional Chinese wedding attire. But now Tie says that just a month after she married \u201cthe most controversial scientist in the world,\u201d her plans to relocate from Los Angeles to Beijing to be with He are in disarray; she says she\u2019s been denied entry to China and the two \u201cmay never see each other again,\u201d as He\u2019s passport is being held by Chinese authorities and he can\u2019t leave the country.",

    "Reached by phone in Manila, Tie said authorities in the Philippines had intercepted her during a layover on May 17 and told her she couldn\u2019t board a plane to China, where she was born and where she says she has a valid 10-year visa. She claims they didn\u2019t say why but told her she is likely \u201con a watch list.\u201d (MIT Technology Review could not independently confirm Tie\u2019s account.)\u00a0 \u201cWhile I\u2019m concerned about my marriage, I am more concerned about what this means for humanity and the future of science,\u201d Tie posted to her own X account. A match made in gene-editing heaven The romance between He and Tie has been playing out in public over the past several weeks through a series of reveals on He\u2019s X feed, which had already started going viral late last year thanks to his style of posting awkward selfies alongside maxims about the untapped potential of heritable gene editing, which involves changing people\u2019s DNA when they\u2019re just embryos in an IVF dish.\u00a0 \u201cHuman [sic] will no longer be controlled by Darwin\u2019s evolution,\u201d He wrote in March. That post, which showed him standing in an empty lab, gazing into the distance, garnered 9.7 million views. And then, a week later, he collected 13.3 million for this one: \u201cEthics is holding back scientific innovation and progress.\u201d\u00a0  In April, the feed started to change even more drastically.\u00a0 He\u2019s posts became increasingly provocative, with better English and a unique sensibility reflecting online culture. \u201cStop asking for cat girls. I\u2019m trying to cure disease,\u201d the account posted on April 15. Two days later, it followed up: \u201cI literally went to prison for this shit.\u201d\u00a0 This shift coincided with the development of his romance with Tie. Tie told us she has visited China three times this year, including a three-week stint in April when she and He got married after a whirlwind romance. She bought him a silver wedding ring made up of intertwined DNA strands.\u00a0 The odd behavior on He\u2019s X feed and the sudden marriage have left followers wondering if they are watching a love story, a new kind of business venture, or performance art. It might be all three.",
    "A wedding photo posted by Tie on the Chinese social media platform Rednote shows the couple sitting at a table in a banquet hall, with a small number of guests. MIT Technology Review has been able to identify several people who attended: Cai Xilei, He\u2019s criminal attorney; Liu Haiyan, an investor and former business partner of He; and Darren Zhu, an artist and Thiel fellow who is making a \u201cspeculative\u201d documentary about the biophysicist that will blur the boundaries of fiction and reality. In the phone interview, Tie declined to say if she and He are legally married. She also confirmed she celebrated a wedding less than one year ago with someone else in California, in July of 2024, but said they broke up after a few months; she also declined to describe the legal status of that marriage. In the phone call, Tie emphasized that her relationship with He is genuine: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry him if I wasn\u2019t in love with him.\u201d An up-and-comer Years before Tie got into a relationship with He, she was getting plenty of attention in her own right. She became a Thiel fellow in 2015, when she was just 18. That program, started by the billionaire Peter Thiel, gave her a grant of $100,000 to drop out of the University of Toronto and start a gene testing company, Ranomics.\u00a0 Soon, she began appearing on the entrepreneur circuit as a \u201cwunderkind\u201d who was featured on a Forbes \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list in 2018 and presented as an up-and-coming venture capitalist on CNN that same year. In 2020, she started her second company, Locke Bio, which focuses on online telemedicine.  Like Thiel, Tie has staked out contrarian positions. She\u2019s called mainstream genomics a scam and described entrepreneurship as a way to escape the hidebound practices of academia and bioethics. \u201cStarting companies is my preferred form of art,\u201d she posted in 2022, linking to an interview on CNBC.\u00a0 By February 2025, Tie was ready to announce another new venture: the Los Angeles Project, a stealth company she had incorporated in 2023 under her legal name, Cheng Cheng Tie. The company, started with the Texas-based biohacker and artist Josie Zayner, says it will try to modify animal embryos; one goal is to make fluorescent glow-in-the-dark rabbits as pets.

    "The Los Angeles Project revels in explicitly transgressive aims for embryo editing, including a plan to add horn genes to horse embryos to make a unicorn. That\u2019s consistent with Zayner\u2019s past stunts, which include injecting herself with CRISPR during a livestream. \u201cThis is a company that should not exist,\u201d Zayner said in announcing the newly public project. Although the Los Angeles Project has only a tiny staff with uncertain qualifications, it did raise $1 million from the 1517 Fund, a venture group that supports \u201cdropouts\u201d and whose managers previously ran the Thiel Fellowship.",
    "Asked for his assessment of Tie, Michael Gibson, a 1517 partner, said in an email that he thinks Tie is \u201cnot just exceptional, but profoundly exceptional.\u201d He sent along a list of observations he\u2019d jotted down about Tie before funding her company, which approvingly noted her \u201chyper-fluent competence\u201d and \u201clow need for social approval,\u201d adding: \u201cThoughts & actions routinely unconventional.\u201d\u00a0 A comeback story He first gained notoriety in 2018, when he and coworkers at the Southern University of Science & Technology in Shenzhen injected the CRISPR gene editor into several viable human embryos and then transferred these into volunteers, leading to the birth of three girls who he claimed would be resistant to HIV. A subsequent Chinese investigation found he\u2019d practiced medicine illegally while \u201cpursuing fame and fortune.\u201d A court later sentenced him to three years in prison.",
    "He has never apologized for his experiments, except to say he acted \u201ctoo quickly\u201d and to express regret for the trouble he\u2019d caused his former wife and two daughters. (According to a leaked WeChat post by his ex-wife, she divorced him in 2024 \u201cbecause of a major fault on his side.\u201d) Since his release from prison, He has sought to restart his research and convince people that he should be recognized as the \u201cChinese Darwin,\u201d not \u201cChina\u2019s Frankenstein,\u201d as the press once dubbed him.\u00a0  But his comeback has been bumpy. He lost a position at Wuchang University of Technology, a small private university in Hubei province, after some negative press. In February 2024, He posted that his application for funding from the Muscular Dystrophy Association was rejected. Last September, he even posted pictures of his torn shirt\u2014which he said was the result of an assault by jealous rivals. One area of clear success, though, was the growing reach of his X profile, which today has ballooned to more than 130,000 followers. And as his public profile rose, some started encouraging He to find ways to cash in. Andrew Hessel, a futurist and synthetic biologist active in US ethics debates, says he tried to get He invited to give a TED Talk. \u201cHis story is unique, and I wanted to see his story get more widespread attention, if only as a cautionary tale,\u201d Hessel says. \u201cI think he is a lightning rod for a generation of people working in life sciences.\u201d Related StoryInside China\u2019s electric-vehicle-to-humanoid-robot pivotHere\u2019s what the country\u2019s big bet on robots might mean for the rest of the globe.",
    "Later, Hessel says, he sent him information on how to join X\u2019s revenue-sharing program. \u201cI said, \u2018You have a powerful voice. Have you looked into monetization?\u2019\u201d Hessel says. By last fall, He was also welcoming visitors to what he called a new lab in Beijing. One person who took him up on the offer was Steve Hsu, a Michigan State physics professor who has started several genetics companies and was visiting Beijing.",
    "They ended up talking for hours. Hsu says that He expressed a desire to move to the US and start a company, and that he shared his idea for conducting a clinical trial of embryo editing in South Africa, possibly for the prevention of HIV.\u00a0 Hsu says he later arranged an invitation for He to give a lecture in the United States. \u201cYou are a little radioactive, but things are opening up,\u201d Hsu told him. But He declined the offer because the Chinese government is holding his passport\u2014a common tactic it uses to restrict the movement of sensitive or high-profile figures\u2014and won\u2019t return it to him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know why. He literally doesn\u2019t know,\u201d says Hsu. \u201cAccording to the law, they should give it back to him.\u201d A curious triangle Despite any plans by He and Tie to advance the idea, creating designer babies is currently illegal in most of the world, including China and the US. Some experts, however, fret that forbidding the technology will only drive it underground and make it attractive to biohackers or scientists outside the mainstream.\u00a0 That\u2019s one reason Tie\u2019s simultaneous connection to two notable biotech renegades\u2014He and Zayner\u2014is worth watching. \u201cThere is clearly a triangle forming in some way,\u201d says Hessel.",
    "With Tie stuck outside China and He being kept inside the country, their new gene-editing venture, Cathy Medicine, faces an uncertain future. Tie posted previously on Rednote that she was \u201chelping Dr. He open up the U.S. market\u201d and was planning to return to the US with him for scientific research. But when we spoke on the phone, she declined to disclose their next steps and said their predicament means the project is \u201cout of the window now.\u201d Even as the couple remain separated, their social media game is stronger than ever. As she waited in Manila, Tie sought help from friends, followers, and the entire internet. She blasted out a tweet to \u201ccrypto people,\u201d calling them \u201ctoo pussy to stand up for things when it matters.\u201d Within hours, someone had created a memecoin called $GENE as a way for the public to support the couple.\u00a0 On May 20, Tie posted on X claiming that the amount donated to them is now worth almost $2 million. \u201cI may need to retract my last statement about crypto,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 He\u2019s X account also retweeted to express support: \u201cI only want to reunite with my wife @CathyTie, and continue my gene editing research.\u201d He added the hashtag $GENE. hide"
