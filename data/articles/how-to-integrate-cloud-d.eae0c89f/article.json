    "Building a strong, flexible \u201cdigital core\u201d that integrates cloud, data, and AI technologies to serve as an interconnected foundation for your company is the key to future growth. It is your means of supporting the current business drive toward efficiency and effectiveness, while remaining flexible enough to respond to the new needs of the organization and quickly adopt and scale the latest technology innovations. According to new research from Accenture on more than 1,500 large, global companies across industries, those that built a reinvention-ready digital core achieved what the researchers call the \u201c60:40 effect.\u201d Compared to a sample baseline, these leaders experienced a 60% acceleration in their revenue growth rate (from 7.1% to 11.1% on average) while increasing profitability by 40% (from 14.2 to 19.4 percentage points on average). The researchers found that the digital core has vastly expanded in importance, driven by the pandemic and explosion of gen AI. No matter your industry, the strategic shift toward continuous reinvention is fueling an urgent need for a digital core that amplifies machines, humans, and the interaction of the two in significant new ways.",
    "We\u2019ve entered an era of radical disruption, where waves of new technologies make continuous reinvention the default business strategy. Generative AI is only the latest innovation of many more to come that organizations will need to accommodate at pace and scale, or risk falling behind their competitors. That means companies must create a \u201cdigital core\u201d that integrates cloud, data, and AI technologies to build an interconnected foundation for the enterprise that balances growth and reinvention, instead of focusing merely on cost.",
