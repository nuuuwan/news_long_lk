    "At first glance, the Bathhouse spa in Brooklyn looks not so different from other high-end spas. What sets it apart is out of sight: a closet full of cryptocurrency-\u00admining computers that not only generate bitcoins but also heat the spa\u2019s pools, marble hammams, and showers.\u00a0 When cofounder Jason Goodman opened Bathhouse\u2019s first location in Williamsburg in 2019, he used conventional pool heaters. But after diving deep into the world of bitcoin, he realized he could fit cryptocurrency mining seamlessly into his business. That\u2019s because the process, where special computers (called miners) make trillions of guesses per second to try to land on the string of numbers that will earn a bitcoin, consumes tremendous amounts of electricity\u2014which in turn produces plenty of heat that usually goes to waste.\u00a0 Related StoryBluesky has an impersonator problem\u00a0Cryptoscammers tried to trick me using fake profiles of tech personalities. I am not alone.",
    "\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s interesting\u2014we need heat,\u2019\u201d Goodman says of Bathhouse. Mining facilities typically use fans or water to cool their computers. And pools of water, of course, are a prominent feature of the spa.\u00a0 It takes six miners, each roughly the size of an Xbox\u00a0One console, to maintain a hot tub at 104 \u00b0F. At Bathhouse\u2019s\u00a0 Williamsburg location, miners hum away quietly inside two large tanks, tucked in a storage closet among liquor bottles and teas. To keep them cool and quiet, the units are immersed directly in non-conductive oil, which absorbs the heat they give off and is pumped through tubes beneath Bathhouse\u2019s hot tubs and hammams.",
    "Mining boilers, which cool the computers by pumping in cold water that comes back out at 170 \u00b0F, are now also being used at the site. A thermal battery stores excess heat for future use.\u00a0 Goodman says his spas aren\u2019t saving energy by using bitcoin miners for heat, but they\u2019re also not using any more than they would with conventional water heating. \u201cI\u2019m just inserting miners into that chain,\u201d he says.",
    "Goodman isn\u2019t the only one to see the potential in heating with crypto. In Finland, Marathon Digital Holdings turned fleets of bitcoin miners into a district heating system to warm the homes of 80,000 residents. HeatCore, an integrated energy service provider, has used bitcoin mining to heat a commercial office building in China and to keep pools at a constant temperature for fish farming. This year it will begin a pilot project to heat seawater for desalination. On a smaller scale, bitcoin fans who also want some extra warmth can buy miners that double as space heaters.\u00a0 Crypto enthusiasts like Goodman think much more of this is coming\u2014especially under the Trump administration, which has announced plans to create a bitcoin reserve. This prospect alarms environmentalists.\u00a0 The energy required for a single bitcoin transaction varies, but as of mid-March it was equivalent to the energy consumed by an average US household over 47.2 days, according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, run by the economist Alex de Vries.\u00a0 Related StoryInside a romance scam compound\u2014and how people get tricked into being thereSurvivors reveal how criminal syndicates use Big Tech to recruit and trap people into operating \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams\u2014and then use the same platforms to steal billions of dollars from targets all over the world.",
    "Among the various cryptocurrencies, bitcoin mining gobbles up the most energy by far. De Vries points out that others, like ethereum, have eliminated mining and implemented less energy-\u00adintensive algorithms. But bitcoin users resist any change to their currency, so de\u00a0Vries is doubtful a shift away from mining will happen anytime soon.\u00a0 One key barrier to using bitcoin for heating, de Vries says, is that the heat can only be transported short distances before it dissipates. \u201cI see this as something that is extremely niche,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not competitive, and you can\u2019t make it work at a large scale.\u201d\u00a0 The more renewable sources that are added to electric grids to replace fossil fuels, the cleaner crypto mining will become. But even if bitcoin is powered by renewable energy, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make it sustainable,\u201d says Kaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment, and Health. Mining burns through valuable resources that could otherwise be used to meet existing energy needs, Madani says.\u00a0 For Goodman, relaxing into bitcoin-heated water is a completely justifiable use of energy. It soothes the muscles, calms the mind, and challenges current economic structures, all at the same time.\u00a0 Carrie Klein is a freelance journalist based in New York City.  hide"
