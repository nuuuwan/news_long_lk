Sri Lanka must broaden its definition of educational success

A new vision for Sri Lanka’s education landscape

This article serves as Part II of the series originally published in the Daily FT under the title “Reimagining Sri Lanka’s university system.” I collaborated with a fellow civil engineer who graduated from the University of Moratuwa in 1987 and has since charted an impressive career path in the international corporate sector via the Asia Pacific Region. He brings a wealth of insight into the vocational training landscape in both Singapore and Australia. He also shares valuable perspectives drawn from his role on the External Advisory Committee for the practical undergraduate degree programs at Western Sydney University.

Every compelling professional article begins with a spark, and mine was a simple yet striking question from a colleague: “Why are Sri Lankan domestic helpers paid significantly less than those from the Philippines?” Without waiting for an answer, he pointed to a key factor: vocational training. In the Philippines, domestic workers undergo structured, hands-on training in simulated household environments, covering everything from appliance use and cleaning techniques to childcare, emergency response, and etiquette. This comprehensive preparation makes them job-ready and justifies the higher wages they command.

This insight prompted me to explore the broader role of vocational education in workforce readiness. With an engineering background and a commitment to lifelong learning including postgraduate studies, management diplomas, and TAFE Certificate III and IV qualifications I have seen firsthand how non-traditional education pathways can strengthen career outcomes.

This piece aims to highlight the transformative power of vocational education and advocate for its role in building a skilled, competitive workforce.

In Sri Lanka, university admission has long been viewed as the ultimate academic milestone, a gateway to prestige, prosperity, and upward mobility. Yet, with limited placements and fierce competition, thousands of capable students are left without a clear path forward. This reality calls for a transformative shift: universities should be one of many options, not the only one. Vocational and technical education must rise as a credible, aspirational, and globally recognised alternative.

By drawing on the proven strategies of Australia’s Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system and Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Sri Lanka can reimagine its education ecosystem to empower youth with practical skills, international mobility, and economic resilience.

Rethinking education: From “white collar” to “new collar”

The binary of “white collar” and “blue collar” work is giving way to a new category, “new collar” professionals. These individuals, often trained through vocational pathways, possess specialised skills in high-demand sectors such as IT, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing. They may not hold university degrees, but their certifications and competencies are globally valued.

For Sri Lanka, embracing this model is not just pragmatic; it is a strategic move. With the right training and internationally benchmarked qualifications, Sri Lankan youth can access better-paying jobs both locally and abroad, avoiding the trap of low-skilled labour migration.

Australia’s TAFE model: A blueprint for Sri Lanka

Australia’s TAFE system offers a nationally consistent, publicly funded framework for vocational education. Aligned with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), TAFE ensures that credentials are stackable, transferable, and internationally recognised.

AQF Qualification Levels Overview:

These qualifications provide pathways for students to pursue further education, including progression to university through credit transfer and articulation agreements. Institutions such as RMIT and Swinburne University offer dual-sector programs that facilitate smooth transitions between vocational and higher education streams.

Singapore’s ITE strategy: A student-centric, industry-aligned model

Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education (ITE) is globally recognised for its pragmatic and future-focused approach. Its strategic roadmap, ITE Elevate (2025–2029), centres on three pillars:

Drive growth: Expand programs aligned with global and local market needs;

Differentiate: Prioritise employability through workplace transformation;

Strengthen core: Foster innovation and continuous improvement

Key features of the ITE model:

Centralised governance across three colleges

Deep industry partnerships for curriculum relevance

Authentic learning environments (e.g., IoT labs, retail training centres)

Applied learning pedagogy focused on experiential education

Global consultancy arm (ITEES) supporting over 30 countries

Adapting the ITE model for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) is well-positioned to integrate ITE’s best practices. Strategic adaptations could include:

A future of possibility

Sri Lanka must broaden its definition of educational success. University is one option, but not the only path. By investing in internationally recognised vocational education and adopting best practices from Australia’s TAFE and Singapore’s ITE models, the country can create a system that is globally competitive and locally relevant. This is not just reform, it’s a strategy to unlock the full potential of Sri Lanka’s youth and ensure every student has a pathway to succeed.
