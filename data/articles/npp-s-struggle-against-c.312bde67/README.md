A record number of front-line politicians has opted out of the November 14 Parliamentary election. Despite over fifty MPs who represented the last Parliament having so evaded the directed contest at district level some of them are anticipating to enter the House through the National List of their respective parties or the parties where they finally took refuge in, on the eve of the September 21 Presidential election.

However, a majority of those who have managed to include their names in National Lists is also doom to fail. Would these politicians have taken a decision not to contest the general election, had any other candidate other than National People’s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the Presidential election?

Given the unprecedented short period between the Presidential election and the Parliamentary election this time, the prospects of the NPP obtaining a comfortable working majority in Parliament is high, though expectations of its leaders to gain a two-thirds majority is highly unlikely to  materialise.

In the event of the NPP gaining a majority in Parliament, it heightens the probability of the government pruning many perks such as the duty-free vehicle permits and bar permits that are being enjoyed by the Parliamentarians directly or indirectly. It can be inferred that many politicians have decided to keep away from the Parliament sensing this possible deprivation of privileges which are their only objective.

Another group of former MPs who might have feared to face the people at the district level polls due to the unpopularity of them or their party have opted to enter Parliament through the National List of their party or a party they have taken refuge in. The National Freedom Front (NFF) of Wimal Weerawansa which withdrew from the election seems to be of this category, in spite of his claim that he has a duty to protect the government of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) from conspiracies since he has a historical claim on the party as a former leader of it. Namal Rajapaksa, the only member of the Rajapaksa clan to seek a seat in the House this time too has evaded the district level preferential poll.

Had the NPP been prepared to embrace politicians from other parties, many would have grabbed the opportunity and entered Parliament under the NPP ticket, without opting out of the fray. In fact, a few such as Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who entered politics with the motivation by the JVP in 2010 tried to use the NPP as a vehicle to Diyawannawa, even testing the integrity of the NPP. However, the party had politely declined to include the former Army Commander in any of their candidate lists, citing one of their selection criteria – working for the party at the just concluded Presidential election.

Kamal Addararachchi who played Rohana Wijeweera, the founder leader of the JVP in the movie “Ginnen Upan Seethala” was also said to have attempted to run for a seat in the legislature under the NPP ticket. When it was also denied the veteran film star joined the Devana Parapura (Second Generation) of Uvindu Wijeweera, the only son of Rohana Wijeweera.

This is a unique situation where one party is rejecting deserters of other parties, whereas all other parties embrace anybody from any party. We witnessed many such defections to various parties except for the NPP, prior to the Presidential election. However, some of such defections have created friction in host parties. No defection is cost free to the host parties as the defectors demand mostly portfolios and positions some of which are tagged with the party tickets for the next election. The issue involving Ajith Mannapperuma, Champika Ranawaka within the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is a best case in point. NPP seems not to want to rock the boat by entertaining strangers to the party.

Cleaner political culture

This stance corresponds with their professed objective of creating a cleaner political culture in place of the prevailing corrupt culture. They argue that a new culture cannot be created with those who defended or tolerated the old corrupt system. Therefore, they have fielded candidates who have been politically brought up by themselves within their political environment.

Addressing the candidates for the oncoming general election at the Grand Monarch Hotel in Thalawathugoda on October 13 President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stressed the need for a “high-quality” Parliament. He said although the NPP wants a powerful ruling party of its own, the quality of MPs of his party is more important than the numerical strength of the government.

Can the NPP bring in a government with absolutely untainted members? It is unlikely in a country where the entire society is corrupt to the core. Raising this question himself at a rally during the Presidential election Dissanayake stated there can be corrupt individuals within their ranks, but they would be weeded out immediately when they are detected.

In fact, it is only in the JVP, the core constituent party of the NPP that has a mechanism to discipline its members and an educational programme for them. They conduct a self-evaluation session during every meeting of party organisations – from politburo to the village-level cells where each member is given an opportunity for self-criticism and criticism of other members. The evaluation includes ideological and practical matters including personal behaviour. This prevents members from deviating from their ideological stances and accepted behavioral norms.

The party also conducts classes and educational camps for the members – from most senior ones to new comers – to improve the political knowledge and to discuss new local as well as international developments. These self-evaluation and educational programmes are being conducted not only during elections but throughout the year, since the JVP is a cadre-based party.

Yet, there have been a few black sheep among the ranks of the JVP. They had been influenced by corrupt environment and unresolved ideological differences. The JVP, as a party has been successful in not being accused of corruption for the past 59 years since its inception. However, it is going to earn the wrath of high profile and dangerous enemies, with the anti-corruption drive.
