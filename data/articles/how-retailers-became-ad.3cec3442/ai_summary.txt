Facts:
- Many large retailers are creating and operating their own advertising platforms, known as retail media.
- Amazon is notably successful in this domain, earning $46.9 billion from advertising in 2023, largely from sponsored ads on its site.
- Other retailers with retail media platforms include Dick’s Sporting Goods, Home Depot, Instacart, Lowe’s, Macy’s, Ulta, and Walmart, with Walmart earning $3.4 billion from retail advertising in 2023.

- The Boston Consulting Group predicts profit margins between 70% and 90% by 2026.
- Retail media takes different forms depending on the retailer; it can focus on delivering digital coupons through loyalty and rewards programs, sponsored search and advertising on e-commerce sites, or selling advertising on third-party platforms.
- Organizational tensions can be a challenge in retail media platforms due to the increased number of stakeholders involved.
- Retail media may also increase competition by lowering entry costs.
- In retail media platforms, retailers both execute the advertising and report on its performance, which breaches the principle of separating execution from measurement.

Opinions:
- The time to launch a retail media platform is now due to its high growth and high margin potential.
- Retail media presents strategic challenges for both retailers and manufacturers, who will need to effectively manage these to succeed.
- In the coming age of retail media, retailers will need new touchpoints with manufacturers, establish transparent reporting systems, and adjust their focus from collaboration to bargaining over time.
- Manufacturers need a major redesign of internal processes and incentive structures to manage the new relationship with retailers, and they must develop alternative reporting systems to independently evaluate return on ad spending.
- Once retail media platforms mature, manufacturers must create new sources of differentiation in response to the increased bargaining power threat.
- The emerging retail media landscape is expected to cause profound changes in the retail sector, providing growth and profit opportunities for those that prepare their business for this disruption.
