Soprema, an international building materials company, has committed to reporting the carbon footprint of each product on every customer invoice. The company’s president, Pierre-Etienne Bindschedler, set this goal in 2022 to help customers reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the products they purchased. Soprema also embarked on a pilot project, led by operations director Melotte, to measure and reduce the carbon embedded in its products. Following a four-stage plan (Project Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, and Action), the project focused on Soprema’s bitumen waterproofing systems and is estimated to potentially reduce the company’s carbon footprint by 34%.
