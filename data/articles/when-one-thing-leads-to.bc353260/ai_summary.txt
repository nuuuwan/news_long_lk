1. 🌐 Global Value Chains (GVCs) are a crucial part of modern production systems, with 80% of global trade taking place in them. 
2. 📱 China has successfully integrated into GVCs, accounting for over 35% of global manufacturing and producing complex products like iPhones.
3. 💹 Unfortunately, many countries in the Global South, such as Sri Lanka, have struggled to benefit from GVCs, often getting stuck in positions of low value-addition.
4. 🏭 The fragmentation of production, where different stages take place in different countries, presents challenges for these countries' economic development.
5. 🇨🇳 China is an exception, managing to increase the value-added by domestic firms in products like iPhones from 3.6% to 25.4% between 2008 and 2017.
6. 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka, despite opening its economy at the same time as China in the 1970s, has not managed to increase domestic value-added significantly.
7. 🧵 The country's major export - textiles and clothing - constitute 35-45% of total exports over the last three decades, an indicator of a lack of diversification.
8. 🌍 The key to succeeding in GVCs may be to think of them as global value hierarchies, with countries seeking to move up the chain into positions of higher value-addition.
9. 🛠️ One way to do this is through proactive industrial policies, facilitating technology transfer and boosting domestic supply chains.
10. 🎯 For countries like Sri Lanka, the challenge is to develop a local productive ecosystem that can create its own technologies and national champions in the global marketplace.
