Research suggests making the decision to retire means grappling with three psychological issues. First, identity issues can loom large for any deeply engaged professional. Even a small step away from a career can make a person wonder who they are without it. Second, many older professionals resist leaving meaningful work. And third is the dread of losing the strong relationships that accumulate over the course of a long, successful career. New research suggests that leaders who develop an accurate awareness of who they really are and what their job really demands of them are much better equipped to overcome the psychological barriers to retirement.
