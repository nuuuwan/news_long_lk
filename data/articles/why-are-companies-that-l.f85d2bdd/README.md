# Why Are Companies That Lose Money Still So Successful?

## Summary ü§ñ

Facts:
- Traditionally, in a well-functioning capital market, only profit-making firms survive and loss-making ones disappear.
- Currently, investors are increasingly drawn to loss-making firms, some more so than profit-making firms.
- Startups with valuations exceeding a billion dollars, known as Unicorns, are commonly loss-making firms attracting investor interest.
- In 1979, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky posited that losses affect human behavior more than gains, impacting investment decisions.
- When a firm announces losses, its stock price typically declines significantly, prompting investors to abandon and lenders to stop financing the business.
- Typically, loss-making firms start restructuring their business and laying off employees, and some even conduct superficial M&A transactions or manipulate earnings to report profits.

Opinions:
- The authors suggest that the trend of investing in loss-making firms could be due to a change in investment priorities over time.
- The authors speculate that losses might have lost their conventional negative meaning in financial calculations.
- Their research suggests that investments should be made in enterprises that deliver delayed but real profits, instead of focusing on short-term accounting profits, to avoid long-term reduction in shareholder wealth. 
- They imply that the actions of loss-making firms, such as restructuring business or manipulating earnings to appear profitable, may be misleading for investors.

In a well-functioning capital market, profits should be the sole criterion for firm survival; that is, firms reporting losses should disappear. Of late, however, loss-making firms are highly sought after by investors ‚Äî often more than some profitable firms. Unicorns, or startups with valuations exceeding a billion dollars, are examples of such loss-making firms. What has changed over time? When and why did losses lose their meaning? The authors‚Äô series of new research papers provide some answers, guiding managers to make the right investments: those that produce delayed but real profits¬†‚Äî not just those that produce short-term accounting profits but decimate shareholder wealth in long run.

In 1979, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously posited that losses loom larger than gains in human decision-making. For example, a dollar of loss affects our behavior more than a dollar of profits. Likewise, when a firm announces losses, its stock price declines more dramatically than it increases for the same dollar amount of profits. Investors abandon and lenders tend to stop financing loss-making firms, which then start restructuring their business lines and laying off employees. Some firms go even further, conducting M&A transactions without substance and ‚Äúmanaging earnings‚Äù to report profits instead of a loss.
