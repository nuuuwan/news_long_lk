The article accuses Israel of acting like Nazi Germany in its treatment of Palestine, perpetrating a holocaust and undertaking a campaign of territorial expansion similar to Hitler's concept of Lebensraum, or "living space". The author suggests that the world is looking away from the situation in the same way they did during the Holocaust, allowing the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and the destruction of homes and livelihoods. The article asks why the world has not intervened to stop what they see as a massacre. It also states that Israel's dominance, particularly in the US, allows them to act without reprimand. The author calls on Israelis to reject hardline politicians and turn to moderates in order to prevent a cycle of violence and uphold values of social justice and compassionate assistance.
