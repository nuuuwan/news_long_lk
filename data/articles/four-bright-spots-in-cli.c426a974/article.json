    "Climate news hasn\u2019t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage. In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world\u2019s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.  We\u2019re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year. China\u2019s flattening emissions  GETTY IMAGES   One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.",
    "That\u2019s happened before, but only when the nation\u2019s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China\u2019s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise. So what\u2019s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it\u2019s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.",
    "Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdAn industry I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI. Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That\u2019s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year. It\u2019s too early to say China\u2019s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030. To be clear, China still isn\u2019t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it\u2019s now both producing most of the world\u2019s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity\u2014and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years. Batteries on the grid  AP PHOTO/SAM HODDE   It\u2019s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it\u2019s needed most.  Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.\u00a0 Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology\u2019s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year. We\u2019re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid. AI\u2019s energy funding influx  GETTY IMAGES   The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.",
    "But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI\u2019s influence on energy: It\u2019s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies. In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they\u2019re looking for alternatives. Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant. Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don\u2019t. There\u2019s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can\u2019t hurt. Good news, bad news  ADOBE STOCK   Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We\u2019ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago. The world is on track for about 2.6 \u00b0C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That\u2019s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it\u2019s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 \u00b0C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal. That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development\u2014and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.\u00a0 The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 \u00b0C goal set out in the international agreement. But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we\u2019ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon. hide"
