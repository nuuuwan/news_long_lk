    "Jeevan\u2019s bride Seethai Srii Naachiar or Seet is a 4th year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland(RCSI) medical university in Dublin.  She is the daughter of N.Rameswaran and Priya Rameswaran. The families of the groom and bride are well known to each other and the marriage was an \u201carranged\u201d union initiated by Jeevan\u2019s mother Rajalakshmi Thondaman.  Incidently Jeevan\u2019s father Arumugan and Seethai\u2019s father Rameswaran are alumni of the Montfort Boys School at Yercaud in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu.",
    "The association  between both families  goes back a long way and is due to the  friendship between  the groom\u2019s great grandfather Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman and the bride\u2019s great grandfather NTS Arumugam Pillai. Both  Thondaman and Arumugam Pillai hail from Sivagangai district in the Tamil Nadu state of India.",
    "Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman\u2019s ancestral village Munapudur is about 6 km away from Arumugam Pillai\u2019s village Thiruppathur. Both great grandfathers are no more but the links between both families remain strong and have resulted  in the marriage between both great grand children. This is manifested clearly in the invitations which give pride of place to both great grandfathers.",
    "Interestingly enough both Jeevan and  Seethai were born in the same hospital St Johns Medical Center in Karaikudi in different years. Both had the same Obstetrician helping in their delivery. Also both  babies and their mothers were warded in the same room at the hospital.",
