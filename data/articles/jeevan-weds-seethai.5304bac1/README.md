Jeevan Kumaravel Thondaman known as Jeevan Thondaman and Jeevan tied the  traditional  “Thali” (mangala sutra) around the neck of  Seethai Srii Naachiar Rameswaran amidst the reverberating crescendo of  the “Kettimelam” wedding drum roll on 23rd  Nov 2025. The  marriage ceremony took  place  during the auspicious hour  from 10.15 to 11.15 am at the Arumugam Pillai Seethaiammaal College  campus  of Thiruppathur in the Sivagangai district of Tamil Nadu state in India.

Among the  large number of dignitaries who attended the wedding at Thiruppathur were  former  Sri Lankan President Presidents  Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prof.Maithree Wickremesinghe, India’s Sivagangai MP Karthi Chidambaram,Thoothukudi MP ms.Kanimozhi Karunanidhi and DMDK leader Ms.Premalatha Vijayakanth. A reception cum banquet  will be held at the Grand Ballroom of the Colombo Hilton Hotel  on 28th November . Another reception would be held in Kotagala also.

As is well known Jeevan is the son of the late Arumugan Thondaman and Rajalakshmi Thondaman.Jeevan Thondaman was first elected to Parliament from the Nuwara -Eliya district in August 2020. He served as a state minister and later as cabinet minister. Jeevan was re-elected to Parliament in 2024. The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Gen -Secy who was born on 9th November 1994 has for long been regarded as a most eligible bachelor. This  Sunday  (Nov 23)recorded  the end of  Jeevan’s eligible bachelr status.

Jeevan’s bride Seethai Srii Naachiar or Seet is a 4th year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland(RCSI) medical university in Dublin.  She is the daughter of N.Rameswaran and Priya Rameswaran. The families of the groom and bride are well known to each other and the marriage was an “arranged” union initiated by Jeevan’s mother Rajalakshmi Thondaman.  Incidently Jeevan’s father Arumugan and Seethai’s father Rameswaran are alumni of the Montfort Boys School at Yercaud in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu.

The association  between both families  goes back a long way and is due to the  friendship between  the groom’s great grandfather Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman and the bride’s great grandfather NTS Arumugam Pillai. Both  Thondaman and Arumugam Pillai hail from Sivagangai district in the Tamil Nadu state of India.

Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman’s ancestral village Munapudur is about 6 km away from Arumugam Pillai’s village Thiruppathur. Both great grandfathers are no more but the links between both families remain strong and have resulted  in the marriage between both great grand children. This is manifested clearly in the invitations which give pride of place to both great grandfathers.

Interestingly enough both Jeevan and  Seethai were born in the same hospital St Johns Medical Center in Karaikudi in different years. Both had the same Obstetrician helping in their delivery. Also both  babies and their mothers were warded in the same room at the hospital.

This column extends its congratulations and best wishes to the happy couple Jeevan Kumaravel Thondaman and Seethai Srii Naachiar Rameswaran
