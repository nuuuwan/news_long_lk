    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O\u2019Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past year, Jim O\u2019Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country\u2019s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US\u2019s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule. Related StoryMeet Jim O'Neill, the longevity enthusiast who is now RFK Jr.\u2019s right-hand manRead next He\u2019s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O\u2019Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.\u00a0 In MIT Technology Review\u2019s profile of O\u2019Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation \u201cworrisome\u201d and \u201cantithetical to basic public health.\u201d",
    "He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation\u2019s public health agency. But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O\u2019Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.",
    "Vaccine recommendations could change further Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.\u00a0 In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O\u2019Neill said he supported the CDC\u2019s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. \u201cResearching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC\u2019s obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cCDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.\u201d Related StoryWhy childhood vaccines are a public health success storyRead next At the beginning of December, O\u2019Neill said, President Donald Trump \u201casked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.\u201d He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. \u201cIt was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations\u2014in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.\u201d\u00a0  But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O\u2019Neill replied, \u201cA lot of parents feel that \u2026 more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn\u2019t remove anyone\u2019s access.\u201d A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio\u2014which are currently required for entry to public schools\u2014should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to \u201ctake the [measles] vaccine.\u201d) \u201cCDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),\u201d he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment. He also said that current vaccine guidelines are \u201cstill subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.\u201d \u201cCDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.\u201d",
    "More support for longevity\u2014but not all science O\u2019Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to \u201cmake the damage of aging something that\u2019s under medical control.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cthe same way of thinking\u201d as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: \u201c\u2018Again\u2019 implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.\u201d\u00a0 O\u2019Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O\u2019Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O\u2019Neill said Thiel told him he \u201cshould really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.\u201d \u201cI just got more and more excited about that idea,\u201d he said. Related StoryMeet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is \u201cwrong\u201dRead next When asked if he\u2019s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for \u201chardcore\u201d longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O\u2019Neill replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including \u201cDeath is humanity\u2019s core problem,\u201d \u201cObviating aging is scientifically plausible,\u201d and \u201cI will carry the message against aging and death.\u201d O\u2019Neill said he agrees with all of them. \u201cI suppose I am [a Vitalist],\u201d he said with a smile, although he\u2019s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.  As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O\u2019Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world\u2019s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC. Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. \u201cIf I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it\u2019s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.\u201d Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: \u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people\u2019s health.\u201d Watch ARPA-H for news on organ replacements and more He promised we\u2019ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting \u201chigh-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.\u201d",
    "O\u2019Neill said that \u201cARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.\u201d The agency has a new director\u2014Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women\u2019s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year. O\u2019Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean H\u00e9bert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack\u2019s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert\u2019s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.",
    "O\u2019Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. \u201cI would try it \u2026 Not today, but \u2026 if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We\u2019re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.\u201d He\u2019s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. \u201cSomeday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients\u2019 own cells,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.\u201d  Longevity lobbyists have a friendly ear O\u2019Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O\u2019Neill said he hasn\u2019t formally worked with them but thinks that \u201cthey\u2019re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.\u201d Related StoryThe first US hub for experimental medical treatments is comingRead next Livingston has told me that A4LI\u2019s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies. O\u2019Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious\u2014the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. \u201cI would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,\u201d he said. There\u2019ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won\u2019t say more for now. Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.",
    "It's a concept that O\u2019Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building \u201cfreedom cities\u201d\u2014a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.\u00a0 Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Pr\u00f3spera, a private city within a Honduran \u201cspecial economic zone,\u201d where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana\u2019s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O\u2019Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him \u201conce or twice a year.\u201d O\u2019Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading\u2014building new \u201cstartup countries\u201d at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024. In 2009, O\u2019Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that \u201cthe healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.\u201d When asked if he still thinks that\u2019s the case, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite 2030, so I think it\u2019s too soon to say \u2026 What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.\u201d",
    "We might expect more nutrition advice When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O\u2019Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to \u201ceat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,\u201d echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat. We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O\u2019Neill: \u201cWe\u2019re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.\u201d Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify \u201cthe healthiest fats,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cStay tuned.\u201d hide"
