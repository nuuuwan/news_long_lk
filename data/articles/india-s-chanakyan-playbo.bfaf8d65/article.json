    "India\u2019s approach to Sri Lanka is not reactionary\u2014it is deeply strategic and grounded in thousands of years of geopolitical thought",
    "Geographically: Sri Lanka sits at a critical point in the Indian Ocean shipping lanes\u2014between East and West, near India, and on China\u2019s maritime routes.",
    "Strategically: It can tilt the balance between India and China, or serve as a bridge between competing regional visions (like India\u2019s SAGAR vs. China\u2019s BRI).",
    "Diplomatically: Its choices in foreign policy, economic partnerships, and defence alignments impact regional stability.",
    "The recent state visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka was marked by ceremonial warmth, smiling photo-ops, and affirmations of historic ties. However, seasoned observers would note that beyond the optics, the visit was a masterclass in calibrated diplomacy\u2014rooted in a strategic tradition far older than modern international relations: the Arthashastra of Kautilya.",
    "India\u2019s foreign policy is often analysed through modern frameworks\u2014realism, strategic autonomy, and regional hegemony. However, an ancient lens reveals a deeper strategic culture. The Arthashastra, attributed to Kautilya (c. 4th century BCE), provides enduring concepts such as the Mandala Theory and the fourfold diplomatic toolkit (Sama, Dana, Bheda, Danda), which remain relevant in India\u2019s approach to neighbours, especially Sri Lanka.",
    "This ancient Indian treatise on governance and statecraft, attributed to the brilliant strategist Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), continues to inform India\u2019s approach to its neighbourhood. The essence of the Arthashastra lies in realpolitik\u2014where the sovereign must secure the state\u2019s interests using a fourfold toolkit: Sama (conciliation), Dana (gifts or inducements), Bheda (division or influence), and Danda (force or deterrence).",
    "India\u2019s engagement with Sri Lanka\u2014particularly during and after this visit\u2014reflects all four instruments, skilfully deployed.",
    "Sama and the power of cultural diplomacy",
    "Modi\u2019s speeches repeatedly invoked shared heritage, civilisational links, and religious commonality\u2014especially Buddhism. These overtures form the foundation of Sama\u2014conciliation and narrative-building. India positions itself not merely as a strategic partner, but as a cultural sibling, invoking millennia of intertwined history. Such messaging resonates not just with Sri Lanka\u2019s policymakers but also with the public psyche, particularly in an environment where international alignment is being intensely scrutinised.",
    "Dana and economic statecraft",
    "India\u2019s economic outreach\u2014highlighted during the visit\u2014is emblematic of Dana. With over $ 4 billion in support during Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis in 2022, India now leverages that goodwill through long-term economic engagements: infrastructure, digital connectivity, energy security, and logistics hubs.",
    "Recent announcements on collaborative projects in Trincomalee, renewable energy corridors, and port infrastructure all serve a dual purpose\u2014economic development and strategic entrenchment.",
    "Bheda and strategic influence",
    "While diplomacy is the visible layer, India\u2019s parallel engagements with diverse Sri Lankan political actors\u2014from Tamil political representatives to key southern figures\u2014signal the use of Bheda. This strategic outreach ensures India\u2019s influence remains embedded across ethnic and political lines, insulating its interests regardless of domestic political shifts in Colombo.",
    "This is not interference per se\u2014but it is calibrated access, influence, and insurance.",
    "Danda and maritime deterrence",
    "Though India avoids overt pressure, the subtext is clear: security cooperation remains critical. India continues to strengthen naval collaboration, joint patrols, and intelligence partnerships in the Indian Ocean Region. Its naval footprint, enhanced training programs, and cyber-cooperation platforms quietly reinforce deterrence.",
    "Danda in this context is not coercion\u2014it is preparedness. It\u2019s a message to Sri Lanka and others: India remains the preeminent security provider in the region.",
    "Mandala Theory in practice",
    "Kautilya\u2019s Mandala Theory posits that a state\u2019s immediate neighbours are potential threats or dependencies, while allies lie beyond. For India, Sri Lanka is a critical link in its first strategic ring. With China\u2019s presence growing\u2014via infrastructure projects like Hambantota and Colombo Port City\u2014India is recalibrating its posture.",
    "The law of the fish emphasises the need to protect weaker states from predatory powers to ensure regional stability",
    "This visit was not just reassurance; it was a signal\u2014to Sri Lanka, to China, and to the region.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s counter-framework: Balance, Not bandwagoning",
    "The key question is: How should Sri Lanka respond?",
    "Sri Lanka must not default into orbit around any single power. Instead, it must craft a strategic counter-framework that emphasises:",
    "Strategic balancing between India, China, and other major powers;",
    "Sovereign-first economic policy, ensuring national interests in every agreement;",
    "Internal political stability, minimising the scope for external manipulation;",
    "nAnd a bold, new Maritime Neutrality Doctrine\u2014positioning Sri Lanka as an open, collaborative, but unaligned actor in the Indian Ocean.",
    "Colombo must not allow itself to become a pawn in someone else\u2019s grand strategy. Rather, it should present itself as a resilient, sovereign maritime pivot, essential to regional peace and trade.",
    "India\u2019s approach to Sri Lanka is not reactionary\u2014it is deeply strategic and grounded in thousands of years of geopolitical thought. For Sri Lanka to protect its space and future, it must understand this paradigm, and respond not with confrontation or dependence, but with clear-eyed diplomacy, strategic clarity, and national unity.",
    "Kautilya wrote for kings\u2014but his lessons endure for nations. Sri Lanka must now write its own chapter\u2014one of sovereign pragmatism in a contested ocean.",
