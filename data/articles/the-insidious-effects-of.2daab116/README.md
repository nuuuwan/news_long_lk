As the demands of work and personal life blur in an era of hyperconnectivity and hustle culture, hurry sickness — characterized by behaviors and emotions like impatience, chronic rushing, and a constant sense of time scarcity — is more insidious than ever, quietly sabotaging productivity, relationships, and health. If you find yourself with an urgent need to slow down, your health, your teams, the people you serve through your work, and your loved ones will thank you for taking steps to free yourself from hurry sickness. It’s not about how fast you go; it’s about how well you use the time you have.

In today’s fast-paced world, the pressure to do more, achieve more, and be more in less time has become a pervasive part of modern life — and it’s wearing employees out. The authors of one study on professional service firms found that the majority of respondents described their jobs as “highly demanding, exhausting, and chaotic,” and also took it for granted “that working long hours was necessary for their professional success.” Their conclusions echo the results of another recent global workforce survey based on more than 56,000 employees, where 45% said their workload had significantly increased over the past 12 months and more than half felt there was too much change at their workplace happening too quickly.
