    "Picture it: I\u2019m minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). A friend of a friend wanders up, and we strike up a conversation. It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I\u2019m a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: \u201cShould I be using AI? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s awful for the environment.\u201d\u00a0 Related StoryWe did the math on AI\u2019s energy footprint. Here\u2019s the story you haven\u2019t heard.Read next This actually happens pretty often now. Generally, I tell people not to worry\u2014let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want.\u00a0  That response might surprise some people, but I promise I\u2019m not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. (That\u2019s roughly as much as Japan.)\u00a0 But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: \u201cWhat should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?\u201d",
    "That one gets under my skin because of the context: BP helped popularize the concept of a carbon footprint in a marketing campaign in the early 2000s. That framing effectively shifts the burden of worrying about the environment from fossil-fuel companies to individuals.\u00a0 The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. We need companies to innovate and take decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Focusing too much on individuals is a distraction from the real solutions on the table.",
    "Ask AIWhy it matters to you?BETAHere\u2019s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates\u2014it might get weirdA location I care about is.Tell me why it mattersLearn more about how we're using AI. I see something similar today with AI. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture.\u00a0 Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. A couple of recent reports put the electricity used to query a chatbot at about 0.3 watt-hours, the same as powering a microwave for about a second. That\u2019s so small as to be virtually insignificant. But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power\u2014about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.\u00a0 (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.) Related StoryIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt usesRead next Increasingly, there\u2019s no getting away from AI, and it\u2019s not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider\u2019s suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you\u2019re shopping online.\u00a0 Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices.\u00a0 Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that\u2019s changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact.\u00a0 Ultimately, as long as you aren\u2019t relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn\u2019t be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.\u00a0 This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter.
