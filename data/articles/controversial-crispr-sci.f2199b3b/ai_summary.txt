1. 🧪 Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui, who controversially gene-edited human embryos, claims he will continue his research but only on animals and nonviable human embryos.
2. 🚫 He stated he will not attempt to create pregnancies until society accepts his concept of 'genetic vaccines'.
3. 🗣️ The discussion occurred during an online roundtable hosted by MIT Technology Review.
4. 🏛️ He Jiankui confirmed he currently operates a private lab in Sanya, Hainan province, where he researches gene therapy for rare diseases and potential genetic resistance to Alzheimer's.
5. 💰 His work is financially supported by anonymous investors from both the US and China, including a proposed research company in Silicon Valley.
6. 🧑‍🔬 His goal is to eventually test embryo gene editing in mice, monkeys and human nonviable embryos in order to investigate the prevention of Alzheimer's in future generations.
7. 👶 There will be no more gene-edited babies or pregnancies until society accepts the technology. 
8. 🤝 He has been reportedly offered funding from Silicon Valley investors to start a company, a proposal he is considering.
9. 📃 He Jiankui believes that in 50 years, embryo gene editing will be as common as IVF to prevent genetic diseases.
10. 🚧 The major hurdles to broad use of CRISPR in health care lie in problems with delivery for somatic gene therapy and societal acceptance for embryo gene editing.
