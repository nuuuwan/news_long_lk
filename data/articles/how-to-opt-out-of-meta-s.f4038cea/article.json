    "MIT Technology Review's How To series helps you get things done.\u00a0 If you post or interact with chatbots on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, or WhatsApp, Meta can use your data to train its generative AI models beginning June 26, according to its recently updated privacy policy. Even if you don\u2019t use any of Meta\u2019s platforms, it can still scrape data such as photos of you if someone else posts them.  Internet data scraping is one of the biggest fights in AI right now. Tech companies argue that anything on the public internet is fair game, but they are facing a barrage of lawsuits over their data practices and copyright. It will likely take years until clear rules are in place.\u00a0 In the meantime, they are running out of training data to build even bigger, more powerful models, and to Meta, your posts are a gold mine.",
    "If you\u2019re uncomfortable with having Meta use your personal information and intellectual property to train its AI models in perpetuity, consider opting out. Although Meta does not guarantee it will allow this, it does say it will \u201creview objection requests in accordance with relevant data protection laws.\u201d\u00a0 What that means for US users Users in the US or other countries without national data privacy laws don\u2019t have any foolproof ways to prevent Meta from using their data to train AI, which has likely already been used for such purposes. Meta does not have an opt-out feature for people living in these places.",
    "A spokesperson for Meta says it does not use the content of people\u2019s private messages to each other to train AI. However, public social media posts are seen as fair game and can be hoovered up into AI training data sets by anyone. Users who don\u2019t want that can set their account settings to private to minimize the risk.\u00a0 The company has built in-platform tools that allow people to delete their personal information from chats with Meta AI, the spokesperson says. How users in Europe and the UK can opt out\u00a0 Users in the European Union and the UK, which are protected by strict data protection regimes, have the right to object to their data being scraped, so they can opt out more easily.\u00a0 If you have a Facebook account: 1. Log in to your account. You can access the new privacy policy by following this link. At the very top of the page, you should see a box that says \u201cLearn more about your right to object.\u201d Click on that link, or here.\u00a0 Alternatively, you can click on your account icon at the top right-hand corner. Select \u201cSettings and privacy\u201d and then \u201cPrivacy center.\u201d On the left-hand side you will see a drop-down menu labeled \u201cHow Meta uses information for generative AI models and features.\u201d Click on that, and scroll down. Then click on \u201cRight to object.\u201d\u00a0 2. Fill in the form with your information. The form requires you to explain how Meta\u2019s data processing affects you. I was successful in my request by simply stating that I wished to exercise my right under data protection law to object to my personal data being processed. You will likely have to confirm your email address.\u00a0 3. You should soon receive both an email and a notification on your Facebook account confirming if your request has been successful. I received mine a minute after submitting the request. If you have an Instagram account:\u00a0 1. Log in to your account. Go to your profile page, and click on the three lines at the top-right corner. Click on \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d 2. Scroll down to the \u201cMore info and support\u201d section, and click \u201cAbout.\u201d Then click on \u201cPrivacy policy.\u201d At the very top of the page, you should see a box that says \u201cLearn more about your right to object.\u201d Click on that link, or here.\u00a0 3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as above.\u00a0 hide"
