Diana Gamage, a member of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party in the Sri Lankan parliament, has been ruled by the Supreme Court as not being a citizen of Sri Lanka, a ruling she has publicly declined to accept. Despite originally entering parliament as part of the SJB, Gamage quickly switched allegiances to support President Gotabaya Rajapaksaâ€™s 20th amendment to the Constitution, causing friction with her former party. She then served as State Minister for Tourism under President Ranil Wikcremasinghe. However, it has been suggested that she achieved her political positions through deception, including altering her birth certificate to obtain a new national ID Card whilst retaining her British citizenship. This allegedly allowed her to procure a Sri Lankan passport and subsequently a diplomatic one. Her behaviour in parliament has also been criticised, with reports of bullying, threatening language and physical confrontations.
