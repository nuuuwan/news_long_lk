    "The writer Dinesh Weerakkody with Pope Francis",
    "Pope Francis, widely regarded as a transformative moral leader, reshaped the papacy by centring it on humility, compassion, and inclusion. His approach to leadership offers vital lessons\u2014across politics, business, and civil society\u2014on how conviction, simplicity, and courage can restore trust and moral clarity in uncertain times.",
    "Humility over hierarchy",
    "From the outset of his papacy in 2013, Francis broke with tradition. He declined the opulence of the papal palace, rode public transport, and chose the name \u201cFrancis\u201d in honour of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the poor. These decisions weren\u2019t mere symbolism\u2014they were statements of principle. He showed the world that real authority stems not from position or ceremony, but from service and proximity to the people.",
    "His papacy consistently placed compassion above protocol. He introduced bold reforms in Church governance, brought unprecedented transparency, and held clergy accountable\u2014challenging long-standing norms. He spoke powerfully on global issues such as climate change, economic injustice, and migration, and reached out to marginalised communities, including the LGBTQ+ community, with empathy and respect. Without straying from the Church\u2019s spiritual foundations, Pope Francis modelled a leadership that embraced both tradition and change.",
    "I had the privilege of meeting Pope Francis on three occasions. Each time, I was struck not by the aura of his office, but by his authenticity, warmth, and humanity. Whether dining with the homeless or showing patience with restless children during public appearances, he lived his message. And when necessary, he acted decisively\u2014removing senior clergy who failed to uphold the Church\u2019s moral standards. His leadership balanced kindness with accountability.",
    "From his life and work, we can draw six timeless lessons:",
    "Build people up \u2013 Inspire dignity, confidence, and hope.",
    "Model your values \u2013 Let your actions reflect your beliefs.",
    "Stay focused \u2013 Prioritise mission over image.",
    "Make courageous decisions \u2013 Stand firm in principle, even when it\u2019s difficult.",
    "Embrace lifelong learning \u2013 Be open to new ideas while respecting core truths.",
    "Be inclusive \u2013 Welcome and respect all, regardless of background or belief.",
    "These principles apply as much in boardrooms and parliaments as they do in religious institutions. In a world often divided by ideology and ego, Francis reminded us that leadership is about service, and greatness lies in the ability to uplift others.",
    "At a time of rising polarisation and diminishing trust in institutions, Pope Francis stood out as a unifying figure. His commitment to interfaith dialogue, solidarity with the vulnerable, and tireless focus on human dignity repositioned the Church as a force for healing and hope.",
    "Pope Francis leaves behind more than a legacy\u2014he leaves a moral compass for the world. By choosing humility over hierarchy and authenticity over rhetoric, he redefined what it means to lead. His example will continue to inspire those who seek not just to hold power, but to use it for the good of all.",
