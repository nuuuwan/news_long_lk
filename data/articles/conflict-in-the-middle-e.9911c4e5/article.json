    "Over the past few weeks the long-running but largely contained conflict in the Middle East has escalated markedly. Israel has switched its military focus to Hizbullah, an Iranian-sponsored Lebanese Shia group that is designated as a terrorist organisation by the US, the EU and others, including the Gulf Co-operation Council states, and that has been attacking Israel with rockets since last October in support of Hamas after that group\u2019s own lethal assault on Israel. Through a combination of unconventional operations (exploding communication devices), extensive air attacks, including on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and now a limited ground offensive, Israel has dealt Hizbullah a serious blow and has killed its revered leader, and close ally of Iran, Hassan Nasrallah.",
    "Such actions prompted\u00a0Iran to launch direct missile strikes on Israel\u00a0(causing limited damage, but some missiles did get through Israel\u2019s defences), which Iran said were retaliation for the killing of Mr\u00a0Nasrallah as well as other senior members of its so-called axis of resistance, including Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was assassinated in Tehran, the Iranian capital, in July (assumed to be by Israel). Iran reportedly provided some warning of the attack (although less clearly than when it struck in April), which involved about 180\u00a0missiles, and said that there would be no further attacks, unless Israel retaliated.",
    "The Iranian attack on Israel has been widely condemned, including by the US, which helped to shoot down the missiles, and\u00a0Israel has said that it will respond. This places the region at a dangerous inflection point. Israel was persuaded, mainly by the US, to limit its response to Iran\u2019s April direct missile attack to a largely symbolic strike on some of Iran\u2019s air defences. But that restraint acknowledged that Israel had provoked the direct strike from Iran by earlier hitting its consulate in Damascus, the Syria capital, deemed to be Iran\u2019s sovereign territory, and killing several senior members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran\u2019s stated rationale for its latest direct missile strike on Israel does not carry the same justification and Israel will feel obliged to respond far more severely, in return risking more strikes from\u00a0Iran.",
    "The situation remains very fluid and highly uncertain, but we have tried to map out some scenarios that could play out with probabilities.\u00a0It needs to be recalled that Israel is, and has been for some time, fighting a multi-front conflict involving Hamas in Gaza, Hizbullah in Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen (who are also disrupting non-Israel-related shipping in the region, leading to retaliatory air strikes from the US and others), various Iranian-supported militias in Syria and Iraq (one of which struck a US military post in Jordan in January), as well as Iran, following calibrated reciprocal direct strikes by Iran and Israel in April, which were quickly de-escalated.",
    "Partial de-escalation\u201455%:\u00a0Israel responds to Iran\u2019s missile strike with its own on Iran. But in response to US pressure, these are directed at military targets and relatively limited in scope, providing enough leeway for Iran to refrain from further direct action. The assumption being that Iran still wants to avoid a broader confrontation with Israel, which might bring in the US. Meanwhile, a war of attrition develops between Israel and Hizbullah in Lebanon as the former tries to push the group back north of the Litani River, and thereby reduce its capacity to easily target northern Israel. The conflict is protracted, with Hizbullah disinclined to accept calls to implement the existing UN resolution 1701 involving the demilitarisation of southern Lebanon. The only off-ramp appears to be a peace deal in Gaza, negotiations for which drag on into the first quarter of 2025 with intransigence from both sides. Meanwhile, the Houthis continue to launch sporadic missiles strikes at Israel, bringing further retaliatory air strikes on its infrastructure in Yemen. Similarly, various Iraqi militias launch sporadic but ineffective attacks on\u00a0Israel.",
    "Major escalation\u201430%:\u00a0Israel launches large-scale missiles strikes against key Iranian military and energy infrastructure, the latter against US wishes. Iran responds with further large-scale strikes on Israel and authorises Hizbullah to launch its Iranian-supplied stash of missiles on Israel\u2014at which point Israel strikes Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The US is compelled to assist Israel in its defence and in the process is brought into direct conflict with Iran. Damage to Iran, Israel and Lebanon is extensive, shipping through the Strait of Hormuz is disrupted and Iran also potentially lashes out at other countries in the Gulf region that it sees as facilitating Israel and the US. In effect, a regional war breaks out with devastating and unpredictable consequences.",
    "Successful de-escalation\u201415%:\u00a0Massive international diplomatic efforts are brought to bear on Israel, Hamas, Iran and its proxies to bring an end to the conflict. Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s missile attack is heavily restrained and Iran pushes Hizbullah to implement UN resolution 1701 and withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon. This reduces Hizbullah\u2019s capacity to easily target northern Israel and achieves Israel\u2019s stated war aim of securing the safe return of it citizens to that area. Furthermore, a peace deal is agreed in Gaza that removes the stated rationale for attacks on Israel by Hizbullah, the Houthis and other Iranian-aligned regional militias in Iraq and Syria. Many complex issues, including that of a two-state solution for Palestine, suggest a low probability of such a scenario, although elements could be achieved separately.",
