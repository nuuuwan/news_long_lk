The article discusses the involvement of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel in the Russo-Ukraine conflict, highlighting the recruitment of battle-hardened troops from Sri Lanka due to their military experience. Many veterans, now facing economic hardship after having their special allowances cut, are targeted by military recruiters. Some local recruiters, including a former Major General and an ex-sergeant, facilitate this process. 

Sri Lankan veterans face challenges reintegrating into society, often ending up in low-paying security jobs or even criminal activities. This economic struggle is exacerbated by the high cost of living and insufficient wages, forcing many to seek better-paying opportunities, even in conflict zones like Ukraine, where mercenary salaries significantly exceed local pay.

The article emphasizes that many Sri Lankans are leaving the country due to economic hardship, with a record number of passports issued in 2022. It condemns the local government for failing to provide adequate opportunities, compelling citizens to seek dangerous alternatives abroad to sustain their families with dignity. The veterans are not being scammed but are making a desperate choice in the face of limited options left by corrupt politicians.
