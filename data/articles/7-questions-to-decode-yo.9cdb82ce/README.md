It’s well known that understanding your boss’s priorities is crucial for career success. Yet many professionals find themselves guessing what their manager really wants or needs. The result? Misaligned efforts, wasted time, and missed opportunities for both you and your leadership. The problem isn’t just busy bosses or poor communication — it’s that we often don’t ask the good questions to get inside our manager’s head. Here are seven questions designed to uncover your boss’s true priorities, pressures, and preferences.

You probably know that to succeed in your role, you need to align with your manager’s priorities. In an ideal world, all leaders would be clear about their expectations and proactive about sharing what’s on their mind. But in reality, most bosses can be frustratingly vague. They might launch into a rambling explanation that leaves you more confused than when you started. Or perhaps you’re told to “just keep doing what you’re doing” or brusquely brushed off as they rush to their next commitment.
