The result? Misaligned efforts, wasted time, and missed opportunities for both you and your leadership.

Here are seven questions designed to uncover your boss\u2019s true priorities, pressures, and preferences.",
    "You probably know that to succeed in your role, you need to align with your manager\u2019s priorities.

They might launch into a rambling explanation that leaves you more confused than when you started. Or perhaps you\u2019re told to \u201cjust keep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d or brusquely brushed off as they rush to their next commitment.",
