In the heart of Sri Lanka, education is more than just schooling; it’s a deeply ingrained aspiration, a pathway to a better future for our children and our nation. Yet, we grapple with persistent challenges: uneven access to quality teaching, disparities in resources between schools, and the pervasive culture of private tuition that often burdens families and highlights perceived gaps in formal schooling. The promise of truly equal educational opportunity remains a work in progress.

But what if a strategic embrace of technology could offer a powerful solution, not just improving access, but fundamentally reshaping how we teach, learn, and certify knowledge across the island? The proposed digital learning model has the potential to do just that – standardising quality, empowering educators, engaging students, and providing parents with greater assurance.

Let’s delve into this model and understand its transformative potential from different perspectives.

For the Ministry of Education: A strategic investment in standardisation and sustainability

From a policy perspective, this digital model represents a unique opportunity to leapfrog traditional limitations and build a truly standardised educational backbone. By providing well-structured video lessons online, meticulously aligned with the national curriculum, the Ministry instantly ensures that every secondary school student has access to the same high-quality core content, regardless of their school’s location or current resources. This addresses a critical aspect of equality in education at scale.

Crucially, the Ministry should view the underlying Learning Management System (LMS) platform as a strategic asset to be monetised. A tiered financial model could be established: offering the full suite of digital resources as a paid service for local fee-levying secondary schools, while providing free and unfettered access to Government-run schools. This creates a sustainable funding mechanism.

Furthermore, the quality and depth of the content – delivered in bite-sized modules with automated checks based on the first three levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy and adaptive support – should be developed to compete robustly with overseas examination bodies like Cambridge and Edexcel at Ordinary Level and Advanced Level. The goal is to attract local students who currently opt for foreign curricula back into the national system, demonstrating that our local education can be world-class and provide a strong foundation for global opportunities.

A significant portion of the earnings generated from the paid access to the LMS should be reinvested directly back into the system. A structured scheme should be put in place to compensate government teachers and the teacher-facilitators who are essential to the success of the flipped classroom model and providing deeper learning support. This acknowledges their evolving, more complex role and provides a direct incentive for their engagement and professional growth within the new paradigm.

For our dedicated teachers: Elevating your craft, deepening your impact

To our invaluable teachers, this model is designed not to diminish your role, but to refine and elevate it. The system handles the consistent delivery of core content through standardised video lessons and automates the initial checks of basic understanding via the LMS.

Your role evolves and becomes even more critical. You transition from being primarily content deliverers to becoming facilitators of deeper learning, mentors who guide students through complex challenges, and experts who provide the personalised support that technology alone cannot. This model allows you to focus your expertise where it matters most – fostering higher-level understanding, critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, and the holistic growth of each student in the classroom.

For our bright secondary school students: Your learning, your pace, your power

Hello! Get ready for a way to learn that is designed to be better and fairer for you, no matter which school you attend. Imagine having access to clear, well-explained lessons that you can watch anytime, anywhere, and a system that helps you see if you’re truly understanding things. That’s the promise of this new model!

First, the success of this model necessitates ensuring digital equality for all of you. This means making sure you have the same access to the online video lessons, and the necessary technology, internet, and devices to easily connect and use them. If everyone has these tools, the online learning field is fair for everyone.

Now, about the lessons themselves:

Lessons in small, easy steps: Your subjects are broken down into small, manageable video lessons. Think of them as bite-sized pieces of knowledge, making it easier to focus and grasp one concept at a time.

Quick questions to check your understanding: After each small video lesson, there will be simple questions on the system. These help you quickly see if you understand the main ideas.

Getting help where you need it: If you find some questions difficult, the system is smart enough to give you extra practice or a different way to understand that specific topic. It’s like having a patient helper available whenever you need a little extra support.

Learning online, deepening in class (The flipped classroom): You’ll often watch these video lessons and answer the basic questions before your class. When you come to school, your teacher can then use the classroom time for more exciting things – discussing complex ideas, working on projects, solving harder problems together, and giving you individual attention.

Why this makes things more equal for your learning:

By giving everyone access to the same clear video lessons and the same system to check basic understanding, this model creates a more equal opportunity for everyone to learn the main things you need to know. No matter which school you attend, you get access to the same explanations and the same basic checks. This helps make sure that everyone builds a strong foundation in the subject. That’s why we call it a pseudo form of equality in education for this part of your learning – it gives you a more standardised and fair chance at mastering the core content.

But remember, this is just one powerful tool. Your teachers are still incredibly important! They will challenge you to think deeper, help you collaborate with friends, develop your creative skills, and guide you in ways that go beyond the information in the videos. This model helps you with the basics so your teacher can help you achieve even greater things in class!

For the parents: Assurance, empowerment, and ending the tuition culture

It is a given that you are deeply invested in your children’s education and often bear significant burdens to support their learning, particularly through private tuition. This digital model offers a pathway to alleviate some of these pressures while ensuring a higher, more consistent standard of education for your child.

The goal of this model is to enhance equality in education, ensuring every child has the same opportunities to learn and succeed. A significant step is providing universal access to the same quality educational materials. This model provides meticulously well-structured video lessons online covering the entire curriculum.

This model has the potential to effectively eliminate the tuition culture in Sri Lanka. How? Because it provides your child with quality education they can access at their own phase, place, and time. The standardised, clear content and built-in checks mean students no longer need to seek external tuition just to grasp the core material or catch up if they miss something in class.

The fact that this enables a flipped classroom model fundamentally reshapes the learning-teaching process in school. The school becomes a place for personal attention – teachers working with students on challenging concepts, projects, and individual difficulties – rather than primarily a place to deliver standardised educational content that students might struggle with and then seek tuition for. It also naturally eliminates the reliance of students on seeking Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistance to do homework, as homework shifts from being a solo exercise in content recall to potentially becoming a supervised activity done at school, focused on applying knowledge with teacher guidance.

Furthermore, this model compels the teachers to up their game, as they engage with learners who have already accessed and been tested on the basic content and are better equipped to ask probing questions. This self-modulating process naturally transitions the teacher into a teacher-facilitator role and the student from a surface learner to a deep learner. There is also a healthy transfer of responsibility to the student and parent for engaging with the foundational content outside of school, while the system decouples teacher effort from student performance on basic recall. It also makes the teaching process more auditable, as the system provides clear data on learner gaps, allowing teacher effort to be measured by their effectiveness in identifying and providing customised solutions for those specific gaps made known to them by the system.

To truly benefit, it is essential that all children have equal access to the necessary technology, a stable internet connection, suitable devices, and digital literacy skills. Achieving this digital equality is a collective effort we must all support.

A vision for tertiary education and national advancement (revisited):

The transformative power of this digital model extends significantly to the tertiary level. Imagine adapting this framework, making the core content of any State university course available online, free of charge, to any citizen. Learning becomes accessible to everyone, everywhere, anytime. State universities would then focus on setting and conducting rigorous, standardised examinations to grant accredited qualifications. This is a direct path to unlocking our nation’s full intellectual potential and driving unprecedented national development.

This digital learning model offers a clear path towards significant educational reform – enhancing equality, empowering stakeholders, and potentially dismantling the tuition culture. It requires vision, investment, and collaboration. Having applied the same model in my teaching practice and having seen how undergraduates and postgraduates take to it and enjoy the process of education where they see real life applicability makes me that much more confident in recommending this model as a national undertaking. I also remain committed to helping anyone interested in implementing this model to help make this vision a reality. I can be contacted at [email protected].

Let us seize this opportunity to build a brighter, more equitable future for every student in Sri Lanka.
