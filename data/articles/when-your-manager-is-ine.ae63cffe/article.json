    "Navigating a relationship with a manager you perceive as ineffective or unqualified can be daunting, but it can also be a catalyst for growth. Rather than allowing frustration to erode your engagement and productivity, shift your focus to what you can control. You may not have control over who you report to, but you can control the beliefs, assumptions, and narratives you create about the situation, as well as the impact of your behavior on those around you.\u00a0 A series of six steps can help you change the dynamic: 1) Reflect on what\u2019s really bothering you; 2) Own your part; 3) Connect to your values: 4) Reframe the story you\u2019re telling yourself; 5) Open a dialogue with your manager; and 6) Be part of the solution. If, after having a honest conversation with yourself and your manager, you still believe they\u2019re the core issue, it might be time to move on.",

John was convinced his manager was out of touch and not adding value.",
