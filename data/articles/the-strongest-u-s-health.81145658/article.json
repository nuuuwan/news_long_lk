    "Being in the business of providing care means spending a lot of time thinking about the human element of the work. After all, people are at the heart of everything that matters most in healthcare \u2014 both those receiving care and those working to provide it. That\u2019s human capital.",
    "Healthcare leaders also spend a lot of time thinking about finances. Money makes it all possible: It allows organizations to hire the best people; maintain safe, clean, and cutting-edge facilities; and innovate to advance and elevate the care we provide. That\u2019s financial capital.",
    "But there is a third form of capital that is just as, if not more, important than human or financial capital. It\u2019s called social capital: the value gained when people work well together, enabling their organization to reach goals they otherwise couldn\u2019t. Teams with strong social capital, through their regular interactions with one another \u2014 and especially the way they work together \u2014 are more effective and are better equipped to do the important work that allows their organizations to thrive.",
    "At a time when financial and human capital are in short supply, it is critical that healthcare leaders focus on building social capital to improve performance and gain competitive advantage. But do leaders understand what it takes to build social capital? Do they know how to measure it? In fact, there are ready and familiar examples from activities that are part of the daily work at provider organizations:",
    "When doctors and nurses round together, that\u2019s social capital.",
    "When employees can report mistakes or raise safety concerns without fear of retribution, that\u2019s social capital.",
    "When people working together say \u201cyes\u201d to requests from team members without needing to hear the details, that\u2019s social capital.",
    "When we have studied the strongest healthcare organizations across the United States \u2014 those with consistently high patient, employee, and business outcomes \u2014 we have seen clear efforts to actively cultivate and champion social capital. High-performing organizations have well-understood values, well-established norms and behavior standards, and well-adopted best practices. These foundational elements are prerequisites to the attributes that characterize top performers: exceptional teamwork, organizational pride, a willingness and ability to work across silos, and \u2014 the connecting thread running through it all \u2014 mutual respect and trust among the team.",
    "Teams and organizations cannot build and maintain social capital without a culture of respect. Analyses of Press Ganey\u2019s national workforce engagement data reveal that feeling respected \u2014 measured by the degree to which employees agree with the statement This organization treats employees with respect \u2014 is the number one driver of employee engagement.",
    "These same analyses show that the degree to which people in different roles feel respected varies significantly. The data reveals strong agreement with the statement among physicians, executives, and managers, yet moderate or low agreement with the statement among nurses and other frontline personnel (maintenance, security, technicians).",
    "The degree of variation points to a real opportunity to be more intentional about fostering respect \u2014 an effort that will pay dividends: Our annual analysis of the aggregate results of all provider organizations who administered Press Ganey\u2019s workforce engagement survey during 2023 (there were about 1.5 million respondents) found that employees who report low levels of feeling respected are eight times more likely to leave their organization. The opposite relationship is also true: Employees who report feel highly respected are more loyal to their organization.",
    "What is more, at organizations whose employees feel respected, patients are more likely to give higher ratings on all facets of their care and on their interactions with members of the care team. This relationship holds true across the continuum of care: Not-yet-published analyses of over 6.5 million survey results from clients using Press Ganey\u2019s patient experience surveys reveal that across all care settings, the number one driver of patients\u2019 likelihood to recommend the organization for care is the care team worked well together to care for me.",
    "There are no tradeoffs associated with investing in building social capital. Additional investments layered on top of a foundation of trust and mutual respect yield compounding, quantifiable returns. A well-established example is the power of a culture of safety to enable organizational learning that leads to significant reduction of safety events. Yet, also well understood is the risk of safety culture backsliding when the work isn\u2019t reinforced on a daily basis. This is why social capital is a unifying force for healthcare improvement, and why building and measuring it should be at the core of organizational strategy.",
    "Engagement surveys are effective tools to measure the strength of social capital among the workforce. Overall measures, such as likelihood to recommend the organization for care or likelihood to recommend it for work, are good starting points. But then dive deeper: look at responses and trends on individual items that evaluate the strength of the bonds between people, within teams, and between employees and the organization. Analyze the data from various units of analysis (team, unit, role, respondent demographics) and pay particular attention to responses to questions that ask about how employees are treated, if they feel their work supports the organization\u2019s mission and values, and the quality of communications and interactions between people and teams. Statistically significant declines in these items signal erosion in relationships between team members, which can negatively impact teamwork, and by extension, outcomes of care.",
    "The table \u201cAsk the Staff\u201d provides examples of the survey questions that get to the heart of social capital.",
    "Responses to these statements can be used to assess strength of social capital in organizations and among teams. Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.",

    "Similarly, the perceptions of patients can be used to evaluate the strength of an organization\u2019s social capital as it pertains to the community served. Again, overall measures such as likelihood to recommend the organization for care and overall rating of care are good starting points, but they do not get at the aspects of experience that speak to social capital. There are several standard survey questions that do, and when performance data are segmented by population cohorts, the strengths and opportunities for improvement readily emerge (reference the table \u201cAsk Patients\u201d).",

    "Unlike financial capital, social capital isn\u2019t depleted by use. And unlike human capital, it\u2019s not diminished by turnover.
