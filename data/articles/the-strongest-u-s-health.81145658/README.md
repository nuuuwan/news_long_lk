Being in the business of providing care means spending a lot of time thinking about the human element of the work. After all, people are at the heart of everything that matters most in healthcare — both those receiving care and those working to provide it. That’s human capital.

Healthcare leaders also spend a lot of time thinking about finances. Money makes it all possible: It allows organizations to hire the best people; maintain safe, clean, and cutting-edge facilities; and innovate to advance and elevate the care we provide. That’s financial capital.

But there is a third form of capital that is just as, if not more, important than human or financial capital. It’s called social capital: the value gained when people work well together, enabling their organization to reach goals they otherwise couldn’t. Teams with strong social capital, through their regular interactions with one another — and especially the way they work together — are more effective and are better equipped to do the important work that allows their organizations to thrive.

At a time when financial and human capital are in short supply, it is critical that healthcare leaders focus on building social capital to improve performance and gain competitive advantage. But do leaders understand what it takes to build social capital? Do they know how to measure it? In fact, there are ready and familiar examples from activities that are part of the daily work at provider organizations:

When doctors and nurses round together, that’s social capital.

When employees can report mistakes or raise safety concerns without fear of retribution, that’s social capital.

When people working together say “yes” to requests from team members without needing to hear the details, that’s social capital.

When we have studied the strongest healthcare organizations across the United States — those with consistently high patient, employee, and business outcomes — we have seen clear efforts to actively cultivate and champion social capital. High-performing organizations have well-understood values, well-established norms and behavior standards, and well-adopted best practices. These foundational elements are prerequisites to the attributes that characterize top performers: exceptional teamwork, organizational pride, a willingness and ability to work across silos, and — the connecting thread running through it all — mutual respect and trust among the team.

Teams and organizations cannot build and maintain social capital without a culture of respect. Analyses of Press Ganey’s national workforce engagement data reveal that feeling respected — measured by the degree to which employees agree with the statement This organization treats employees with respect — is the number one driver of employee engagement.

These same analyses show that the degree to which people in different roles feel respected varies significantly. The data reveals strong agreement with the statement among physicians, executives, and managers, yet moderate or low agreement with the statement among nurses and other frontline personnel (maintenance, security, technicians).

The degree of variation points to a real opportunity to be more intentional about fostering respect — an effort that will pay dividends: Our annual analysis of the aggregate results of all provider organizations who administered Press Ganey’s workforce engagement survey during 2023 (there were about 1.5 million respondents) found that employees who report low levels of feeling respected are eight times more likely to leave their organization. The opposite relationship is also true: Employees who report feel highly respected are more loyal to their organization.

What is more, at organizations whose employees feel respected, patients are more likely to give higher ratings on all facets of their care and on their interactions with members of the care team. This relationship holds true across the continuum of care: Not-yet-published analyses of over 6.5 million survey results from clients using Press Ganey’s patient experience surveys reveal that across all care settings, the number one driver of patients’ likelihood to recommend the organization for care is the care team worked well together to care for me.

There are no tradeoffs associated with investing in building social capital. Additional investments layered on top of a foundation of trust and mutual respect yield compounding, quantifiable returns. A well-established example is the power of a culture of safety to enable organizational learning that leads to significant reduction of safety events. Yet, also well understood is the risk of safety culture backsliding when the work isn’t reinforced on a daily basis. This is why social capital is a unifying force for healthcare improvement, and why building and measuring it should be at the core of organizational strategy.

Engagement surveys are effective tools to measure the strength of social capital among the workforce. Overall measures, such as likelihood to recommend the organization for care or likelihood to recommend it for work, are good starting points. But then dive deeper: look at responses and trends on individual items that evaluate the strength of the bonds between people, within teams, and between employees and the organization. Analyze the data from various units of analysis (team, unit, role, respondent demographics) and pay particular attention to responses to questions that ask about how employees are treated, if they feel their work supports the organization’s mission and values, and the quality of communications and interactions between people and teams. Statistically significant declines in these items signal erosion in relationships between team members, which can negatively impact teamwork, and by extension, outcomes of care.

The table “Ask the Staff” provides examples of the survey questions that get to the heart of social capital.

Responses to these statements can be used to assess strength of social capital in organizations and among teams. Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.

Similarly, the perceptions of patients can be used to evaluate the strength of an organization’s social capital as it pertains to the community served. Again, overall measures such as likelihood to recommend the organization for care and overall rating of care are good starting points, but they do not get at the aspects of experience that speak to social capital. There are several standard survey questions that do, and when performance data are segmented by population cohorts, the strengths and opportunities for improvement readily emerge (reference the table “Ask Patients”).

Responses to certain patient experience questions show the degree to which they are alert to the strength of the organization’s social capital. Patients are asked to rate the quality of their interactions on a five-point Likert scale, with 1 = very poor and 5 = very good.

We also recommend giving respondents an opportunity to offer comments. Then, by using comment analytics — artificial intelligence derived from natural language processing technology — organizations can surface themes and sentiments that underlie the performance data. They offer rich insights into the “why” behind responses to evaluative questions, helping to reveal what great looks like in action and what behaviors and styles can erode social capital.

Unlike financial capital, social capital isn’t depleted by use. And unlike human capital, it’s not diminished by turnover. But like other forms of capital, social capital requires careful stewardship. That’s the responsibility of leaders at every level of the organization. Their playbook should consist of the following:

Capture feedback to understand your baseline performance and form plans to build social capital.

Then, implement those plans and monitor progress.

Continually review the data related to social capital for each part of the organization.

Work across silos: All aspects of the healthcare system matter and are intertwined.

Don’t ignore problems that drain social capital — the kinds of issues that are often reflected in survey responses showing low teamwork or respect. Carefully consider the employee experience.

With the right leadership and team dynamics in play, social capital is self-renewing and creates a compounding, flywheel effect on performance. Investing in social capital improves the experience for all stakeholders in the organization and enables achievement at higher levels than otherwise would be possible.
