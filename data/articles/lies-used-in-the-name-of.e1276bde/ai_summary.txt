President Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka plans to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential elections, backed by a solid alliance. Wickremesinghe and National Peopleâ€™s Power Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) have both presented similar economic plans, focusing on lifting the country out of depression. Wickremesinghe has promised a 5% growth in GDP by 2026-27, and predicts 2048 as the "year of development". However, he is criticized for making ambitious promises and appointing questionable individuals to ministerial roles, leading to recent citizen protests. Linked with a range of institutions and individuals, Wickremesinghe indicates a similar collaborative approach if elected in the next presidential election.
