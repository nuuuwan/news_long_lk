Sri Lanka will need to raise taxes to 14% of GDP by 2028 in order to pay interest on its loans after restructuring, according to a government advisor. The country needs to address debt and taxes to prevent economic crisis. Currently, Sri Lanka raises approximately 9.2% of GDP in taxes. However, businesses and professionals are complaining it's too much. To raise the additional revenue, import-based taxes will need to be reduced while personal, corporate and domestic consumption-based taxes will increase. This could create difficulties for the struggling economy, and the strategies pose challenges to operationalise such as recruiting enough tax officers with the necessary skills and leveraging digitalisation. The tax measures are planned as part of a drive to increase overall revenue as a percentage of GDP from 8.2% in 2022 to 14.9% by 2025.
