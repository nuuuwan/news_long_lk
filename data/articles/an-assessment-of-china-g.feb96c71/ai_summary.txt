China is looking to strengthen its economic ties with the Arab world, as reflected in recent meetings between Chinese President Xi Jinping and several Arab leaders. The 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing saw the attendance of prominent Arab leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. China's economic presence in the Arab world includes significant trade growth, important strategic partnerships, and significant foreign direct investment. Financially, Arab states are hungry for more modern technology, and Chinese firms are willing to provide. Moreover, China often refrains from pointing out human rights violations in Arab countries, which contributes to the solid economic relationship. However, some obstacles to China's goal include the technological superiority of the West, the dominance of the US dollar, and Western transparency standards.
