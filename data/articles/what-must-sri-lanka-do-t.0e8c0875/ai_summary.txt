A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than its first default in 2022, mainly due to harsher conditions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), bilateral creditors and bondholders, according to an economist and consultant on economic policy at the Asian Development Bank. To avoid a second default, Sri Lanka needs to negotiate favourable debt restructuring, improve its credit ratings, drive economic growth, and foster stronger economic partnerships with India. Increasing productivity and efficiency, expanding education, particularly in STEM, and boosting investment in research and development may also prevent a second default. The economist also recommends long-term planning and political consensus to ensure Sri Lanka does not default again.
