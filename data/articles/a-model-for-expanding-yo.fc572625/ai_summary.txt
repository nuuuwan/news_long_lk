A study by cultural psychologists suggests that economic globalization does not eradicate regional cultural differences, which remain significant for multinational corporations (MNCs) seeking to expand. Failures of US-based corporations like Walmart and Best Buy in penetrating international markets were attributed to these companies' inability to adjust to local cultures. To succeed globally, MNCs are advised to adopt a strategy called the REACH model, which stands for Relationships with local partners, Adapting a brand to local culture, Committing to diversity and inclusion, and Harmonizing with local governance. This model, used by Starbucks and TikTok, helps these companies gain consumer trust and make their brands more appealing in foreign markets. Conversely, failure to use the REACH strategies often leads to apathy, distrust, and even litigation from consumers in foreign markets.
