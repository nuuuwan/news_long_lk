1. 🚫 The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has issued an interim order restraining Deshabandu Thennakoon from carrying out his duties as the Inspector General of Police (IGP).
2. 🏛️ This decision led to criticism from the government and a formal rejection of the order in Parliament by the Prime Minister, causing concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. 
3. 🇱🇰 The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) expressed serious concern over the government's response, advising prudence to avoid a constitutional crisis, especially given that the Presidential election is due on 21 September 2024.
4. ⚖️ The interim order came after the courts judged several cases that challenged Thennakoon's appointment as IGP, with the CPA Executive Director being a petitioner.
5. 📜 CPA welcomed the order, stating it upheld the Constitution. It believes that the President's appointment of Thennakoon was invalid as it lacked necessary supports of the Constitutional Council.
6. 👤 Should the President choose not to make an acting appointment, this choice is his own, and he will be responsible for its consequences.
7. 📰 CPA also pointed out that there has been a significant misinformation campaign regarding the verdict, including misleading comments from the Prime Minister.
8. 📝 They argue that the Constitution allows the President to make an acting appointment (Article 41C (2)), putting to rest false claims that it's not possible.
9. 🗳️ CPA also noted attempts to suggest that the interim order could have an impact on elections, but clarified that this is not the case.
10. 🚨 The order permits the President to make an interim appointment according to the Constitution. Regardless, the Election Commission can still issue necessary orders about the election to the police hierarchy.
