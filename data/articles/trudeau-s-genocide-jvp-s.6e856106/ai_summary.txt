Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been referenced as focusing on a 15-year-old genocidal war in Sri Lanka whilst remaining silent on the current alleged genocide by Israel against Palestine. Four months earlier Trudeau had called for justice, reconciliation, and sanctions against individuals involved in the alleged genocide in Sri Lanka yet has remained unclear on his standpoint regarding Israel, despite serious allegations of genocide. Perceptions are that Trudeau's focus on Sri Lanka is due to his reliance on Sri Lankan Tamil votes in upcoming elections due to a lack of popularity with more typical voters. Furthermore, Trudeau made the first Sri Lankan Tamil Cabinet Minister in July 2023 in an attempt to secure votes. Despite this focus on the Sri Lankan Tamil community, none of the UNHRC Resolutions, which Canada agreed to, have made any reference to a genocidal war. It was suggested that Trudeau convenes a 'World Coalition Against Genocide.'
