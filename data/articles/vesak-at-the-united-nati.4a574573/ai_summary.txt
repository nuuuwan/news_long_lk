Sri Lanka celebrated Vesak Day 2024, the principal religious festival which commemorates the birth, enlightenment and passing of the Buddha. It is not an official holiday but is considered a special day globally. The country has tried multiple times to get Vesak recognised as a holiday by the United Nations (UN), however, these efforts have been unsuccessful due to additional costs and scheduling conflicts with existing holidays. Despite this, the UN allowed the non-attendance of meetings on Vesak in places where there is a Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka hopes to continue lobbying for Vesak to be recognised as a UN holiday.
