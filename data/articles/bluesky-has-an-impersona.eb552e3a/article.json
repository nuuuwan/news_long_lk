    "Like many others, I recently fled the social media platform X for Bluesky. In the process, I started following many of the people I followed on X. On Thanksgiving, I was delighted to see a private message from a fellow AI reporter, Will Knight from Wired. Or at least that\u2019s who I thought I was talking to. I became suspicious when the person claiming to be Knight mentioned being from Miami, when Knight is, in fact, from the UK. The account handle was almost identical to the real Will Knight\u2019s handle, and the profile used his profile photo.\u00a0 Then more messages started to appear. Paris Marx, a prominent tech critic, slid into my DMs to ask me how I was doing. \u201cThings are going splendid over here,\u201d he replied to me. Then things got suspicious again. \u201cHow are your trades going?\u201d fake-Marx asked me. This account was far more sophisticated than Knight\u2019s; it had meticulously copied every single tweet and retweet from Marx\u2019s real page over the past few weeks.  Both accounts were eventually deleted, but not before trying to get me to set up a crypto wallet and a \u201ccloud mining pool\u201d account. Knight and Marx confirmed to us that these accounts did not belong to them, and that they have been fighting impersonator accounts of themselves for weeks.\u00a0 They are not the only ones. The New York Times tech journalist Sheera Frankel and Molly White, a researcher and cryptocurrency critic, have also experienced people impersonating them on Bluesky, most likely to scam people. This tracks with research from Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, who manually went through the top 500 Bluesky users by follower count and found that of the 305 accounts belonging to a named person, at least 74 had been impersonated by at least one other account.",
    "The platform has had to suddenly cater to an influx of millions of new users in recent months as people leave X in protest of Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the platform. Its user base has more than doubled since September, from 10 million users to over 20 million. This sudden wave of new users\u2014and the inevitable scammers\u2014means Bluesky is still playing catch-up, says White.\u00a0 \u201cThese accounts block me as soon as they\u2019re created, so I don\u2019t initially see them,\u201d Marx says. Both Marx and White describe a frustrating pattern: When one account is taken down, another one pops up soon after. White says she had experienced a similar phenomenon on X and TikTok too.",
    "A way to prove that people are who they say they are would help. Before Musk took the reins of the platform, employees at X, previously known as Twitter, verified users such as journalists and politicians, and gave them a blue tick next to their handles so people knew they were dealing with credible news sources. After Musk took over, he scrapped the old verification system and offered blue ticks to all paying customers.\u00a0 The ongoing crypto-impersonation scams have raised calls for Bluesky to initiate something similar to Twitter\u2019s original verification program. Some users, such as the investigative journalist Hunter Walker, have set up their own initiatives to verify journalists. However, users are currently limited in the ways they can verify themselves on the platform. By default, usernames on Bluesky end with the suffix bsky.social. The platform recommends that news organizations and high-profile people verify their identities by setting up their own websites as their usernames. For example, US senators have verified their accounts with the suffix senate.gov. But this technique isn\u2019t foolproof. For one, it doesn\u2019t actually verify people\u2019s identity\u2014only their affiliation with a particular website.\u00a0 Bluesky did not respond to MIT Technology Review\u2019s requests for comment, but the company\u2019s safety team posted that the platform had updated its impersonation policy to be more aggressive and would remove impersonation and handle-squatting accounts. The company says it has also quadrupled its moderation team to take action on impersonation reports more quickly. But it seems to be struggling to keep up. \u201cWe still have a large backlog of moderation reports due to the influx of new users as we shared previously, though we are making progress,\u201d the company continued.\u00a0 Bluesky\u2019s decentralized nature makes kicking out impersonators a trickier problem to solve. Competitors such as X and Threads rely on centralized teams within the company who moderate unwanted content and behavior, such as impersonation. But Bluesky is built on the AT Protocol, a decentralized, open-source technology, which allows users more control over what kind of content they see and enables them to build communities around particular content. Most people sign up to Bluesky Social, the main social network, whose community guidelines ban impersonation. However, Bluesky Social is just one of the services or \u201cclients\u201d that people can use, and other services have their own moderation practices and terms.\u00a0 This approach means that until now, Bluesky itself hasn\u2019t needed an army of content moderators to weed out unwanted behaviors because it relies on this community-led approach, says Wayne Chang, the founder and CEO of SpruceID, a digital identity company. That might have to change. \u201cIn order to make these apps work at all, you need some level of centralization,\u201d says Chang. Despite community guidelines, it\u2019s hard to stop people from creating impersonation accounts, and Bluesky is engaged in a cat-and-mouse game trying to take suspicious accounts down.\u00a0 Cracking down on a problem such as impersonation is important because it poses a serious problem for the credibility of Bluesky, says Chang. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate complaint as a Bluesky user that \u2018Hey, all those scammers are basically harassing me.\u2019 You want your brand to be tarnished? Or is there something we can do about this?\u201d he says. A fix for this is urgently needed, because attackers might abuse Bluesky\u2019s open-source code to create spam and disinformation campaigns at a much larger scale, says Francesco Pierri, an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano who has researched Bluesky. His team found that the platform has seen a rise in suspicious accounts since it was made open to the public earlier this year.",
    "Bluesky acknowledges that its current practices are not enough. In a post, the company said it has received feedback that users want more ways to confirm their identities beyond domain verification, and it is \u201cexploring additional options to enhance account verification.\u201d\u00a0 In a livestream at the end of November, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber said the platform was considering becoming a verification provider, but because of its decentralized approach it would also allow others to offer their own user verification services. \u201cAnd [users] can choose to trust us\u2014the Bluesky team\u2019s verification\u2014or they could do their own. Or other people could do their own,\u201d Graber said.\u00a0 But at least Bluesky seems to \u201chave some willingness to actually moderate content on the platform,\u201d says White. \u201cI would love to see something a little bit more proactive that didn\u2019t require me to do all of this reporting,\u201d she adds.\u00a0 As for Marx, \u201cI just hope that no one truly falls for it and gets tricked into crypto scams,\u201d he says.\u00a0 hide"
