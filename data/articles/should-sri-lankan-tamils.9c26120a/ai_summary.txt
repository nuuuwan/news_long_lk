The Tamil Tigers (LTTE) leader's decisions to expel Muslims en masse, conscript children to fight, and assassinate India's Prime Minister were key factors in the group’s downfall, according to the former intelligence chief of the LTTE, Pottu Amman. The former speculated that these decisions, which were driven by the founder leader Velupillai Prabhakaran’s and Pottu Amman’s lack of long-term vision or strategic clarity, deeply harmed the LTTE’s cause. In addition, Prabhakaran’s paranoia led to the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of Tamil militants and civilians, weakening both himself and his outfit.
