    "As a child of an electronic engineer, I spent a lot of time in our local Radio Shack as a kid. While my dad was locating capacitors and resistors, I was in the toy section. It was there, in 1984, that I discovered the best toy of my childhood: the Armatron robotic arm.\u00a0  A drawing from the patent application for the Armatron robotic arm.COURTESY OF TAKARA TOMY   Described as a \u201crobot-like arm to aid young masterminds in scientific and laboratory experiments,\u201d it was the rare toy that lived up to the hype printed on the front of the box. This was a legit robotic arm. You could rotate the arm to spin around its base, tilt it up and down, bend it at the \u201celbow\u201d joint, rotate the \u201cwrist,\u201d and open and close the bright-\u00adorange articulated hand in elegant chords of movement, all using only the twistable twin joysticks.\u00a0   Anyone who played with this toy will also remember the sound it made. Once you slid the power button to the On position, you heard a constant whirring sound of plastic gears turning and twisting. And if you tried to push it past its boundaries, it twitched and protested with a jarring \u201cCLICK \u2026 CLICK \u2026 CLICK.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just kids who found the Armatron so special. It was featured on the cover of the November/December 1982 issue of Robotics Age magazine, which noted that the $31.95 toy (about $96 today) had \u201ccapabilities usually found only in much more expensive experimental arms.\u201d   JIM GOLDEN   A few years ago I found my Armatron, and when I opened the case to get it working again, I was startled to find that other than the compartment for the pair of D-cell batteries, a switch, and a tiny three-volt DC motor, this thing was totally devoid of any electronic components. It was purely mechanical. Later, I found the patent drawings for the Armatron online and saw how incredibly complex the schematics of the gearbox were. This design was the work of a genius\u2014or a madman. The man behind the arm I needed to know the story of this toy. I reached out to the manufacturer, Tomy (now known as Takara Tomy), which has been in business in Japan for over 100 years. It put me in touch with Hiroyuki Watanabe, a 69-year-old engineer and toy designer living in Tokyo. He\u2019s retired now, but he worked at Tomy for 49 years, building many classic handheld electronic toys of the \u201980s, including Blip, Digital Diamond, Digital Derby, and Missile Strike. Watanabe\u2019s name can be found on 44 patents, and he was involved in bringing between 50 and 60 products to market. Watanabe answered emailed questions via video, and his responses were translated from Japanese.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a period where I studied engineering professionally. Instead, I enrolled in what Japan would call a technical high school that trains technical engineers, and I actually [entered] the electrical department there,\u201d he told me.\u00a0 Related StoryRobots are bringing new life to extinct speciesThe field of paleo-inspired robotics is opening up a new way to turn back time and studying prehistoric animals.",
    "Afterward, he worked at Komatsu Manufacturing\u2014because, he said, he liked bulldozers. But in 1974, he saw that Tomy was hiring, and he wanted to make toys. \u201cI was told that it was the No. 1 toy company in Japan, so I decided [it was worth a look],\u201d he said. \u201cI took a night train from Tohoku to Tokyo to take a job exam, and that\u2019s how I ended up joining the company.\u201d",
    "The inspiration for the Armatron came from a newspaper clipping that Watanabe\u2019s boss brought to him one day. \u201cIt showed an image of a [mechanical arm] holding an egg with three fingers. I think we started out thinking, \u2018This is where things are heading these days, so let\u2019s make this,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\u00a0 As the lead of a small team, Watanabe briefly turned his attention to another project, and by the time he returned to the robotic arm, the team had a prototype. But it was quite different from the Armatron\u2019s final form. \u201cThe hand stuck out from the main body to the side and could only move about 90 degrees. The control panel also had six movement positions, and they were switched using six switches. I personally didn\u2019t like that,\u201d said Watanabe. So he went back to work.  The Armatron\u2019s inventor, Hiroyuki Watanabe, in Tokyo in 2025COURTESY OF TAKARA TOMY   Watanabe\u2019s breakthrough was inspired by the radio-controlled helicopters he operated as a hobby. Holding up a radio remote controller with dual joystick controls, he told me, \u201cThis stick operation allows you to perform four movements with two arms, but I thought that if you twist this part, you can use six movements.\u201d  Watanabe at work at Tomy in Tokyo in 1982.COURTESY OF HIROYUKI WATANABE   \u201cI had always wanted to create a system that could rotate 360 degrees, so I thought about how to make that system work,\u201d he added.  Watanabe stressed that while he is listed as the Armatron\u2019s primary inventor, it was a team effort. A designer created the case, colors, and logo, adding touches to mimic features seen on industrial robots of the time, such as the rubber tubes (which are just for looks).\u00a0 When the Armatron first came out, in 1981, robotics engineers started contacting Watanabe. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so much hearing from people at toy stores, but rather from researchers at university laboratories, factories, and companies that were making industrial robots,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were quite encouraging, and we often talked together.\u201d The long reach of the robot at Radio Shack The bold look and function of Armatron made quite an impression on many young kids who would one day have a career in robotics. One of them was Adam Burrell, a mechanical design engineer who has been building robots for 15 years at Boston Dynamics, including Petman, the YouTube-famous Atlas, and the dog-size quadruped called Spot.",
    "Burrell grew up a few blocks away from a Radio Shack in New York City. \u201cIf I was going to the subway station, we would walk right by Radio Shack. I would stop in and play with it and set the timer, do the challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cI know it was a toy, but that was a real robot.\u201d The Armatron was the hook that lured him into Radio Shack and then sparked his lifelong interest in engineering: \u201cI would roll pennies and use them to buy soldering irons and solder at Radio Shack.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cThere\u2019s research to this day using AI to try to figure out optimal ways to grab objects that [a robot] sees in a bin or out in the world.\u201d  Related StoryGoogle DeepMind\u2019s new generative model makes Super Mario\u2013like games from scratchGenie learns how to control games by watching hours and hours of video. It could help train next-gen robots too.",
    "Burrell had a fateful reunion with the toy while in grad school for engineering. \u201cOne of my office mates had an Armatron at his desk,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand it was broken. We took it apart together, and that was the first time I had seen the guts of it.\u00a0 \u201cIt had this fantastic mechanical gear train to just engage and disengage this one motor in a bunch of different ways. And it was really fascinating that it had done so much\u2014the one little motor. And that sort of got me back thinking about industrial robot arms again.\u201d\u00a0 Eric Paulos, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, recalls nagging his parents about what an educational gift Armatron would make. Ultimately, he succeeded in his lobbying.\u00a0 \u201cIt was just endless exploration of picking stuff up and moving it around and even just watching it move. It was mesmerizing to me. I felt like I really owned my own little robot,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cherish this thing. I still have it to this day, and it\u2019s still working.\u201d\u00a0  The Armatron on the cover of the November/December 1982 issue of Robotics Age magazine.PUBLIC DOMAIN   Today, Paulos builds robots and teaches his students how to build their own. He challenges them to solve problems within constraints, such as building with cardboard or Play-Doh; he believes the restrictions facing Watanabe and his team ultimately forced them to be more creative in their engineering. It\u2019s not very hard to draw connections between the Armatron\u2014an impossibly analog robot\u2014and highly advanced machines that are today learning to move in incredible new ways, powered by AI advancements like computer vision and reinforcement learning. Paulos sees parallels between the problems he tackled as a kid with his Armatron and those that researchers are still trying to deal with today: \u201cWhat happens when you pick things up and they\u2019re too heavy, but you can sort of pick it up if you approach it from different angles? Or how do you grip things? There\u2019s research to this day using AI to try to figure out optimal ways to grab objects that [a robot] sees in a bin or out in the world.\u201d",
    "While AI may be taking over the world of robotics, the field still requires engineers\u2014builders and tinkerers who can problem-solve in the physical world.\u00a0  A page from the 1984 Radio Shack catalogue, featuring the Armatron for $31.95.COURTESY OF RADIOSHACKCATALOGS.COM   The Armatron encouraged kids to explore these analog mechanics, a reminder that not all breakthroughs happen on a computer screen. And that hands-on curiosity hasn\u2019t faded. Today, a new generation of fans are rediscovering the Armatron through online communities and DIY modifications. Dozens of Armatron videos are on YouTube, including one where the arm has been modified to run on steam power.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m very happy to see people who love mechanisms are amazed,\u201d Watanabe told me. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that there are still people out there who love our products in this way.\u201d\u00a0 Jon Keegan writes about technology and AI and publishes Beautiful Public Data, a curated collection of government data sets (beautifulpublicdata.com). hide"
