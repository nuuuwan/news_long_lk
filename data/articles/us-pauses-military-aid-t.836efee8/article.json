    "What\u2019s happened?On March\u00a03rd the US president, Donald Trump, ordered the suspension of military aid to Ukraine. This followed a spat\u00a0between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, on February\u00a028th. The military aid that has been suspended includes aid that had already been approved by the former US administration and aid already in transit. Following Mr\u00a0Zelenskyi\u2019s climbdown on March 4th, the US may consider that Ukraine is committing to \u201cgood-faith negotiations\u201d towards a peace process and allow aid to start flowing again.\u00a0However, the longer the US suspension lasts, the more Russia\u2019s leverage grows in the conflict and the peace talks, enhancing its prospects for a deal on extremely favourable terms.Why does it matter?Ukraine is heavily dependent on US military aid.\u00a0Although Ukraine can compensate for some artillery losses with domestically produced drones, the loss of US Bradley fighting vehicles, Patriot missiles and GPS-guided GMLRS rockets will be a major setback. The psychological blow also risks demoralising Ukrainian forces.\u00a0It remains unclear whether the provision of all US intelligence via NATO\u2014which is critical for Ukraine to be able to identify and engage emerging targets in real time\u2014will be affected by the freeze order, although it reportedly includes US intelligence shared with the UK.\u00a0Additional EU military aid could partly close the gap. But Europe still relies heavily on the US military-industrial complex, and US aid would be difficult to replace.The US\u2019s more conciliatory stance towards Russia since Mr\u00a0Trump returned to office has serious ramifications for European security.\u00a0The suspension of US military aid is one of several setbacks for Ukraine. Since taking office, Mr Trump has suggested that Ukraine was responsible for the war, aligning with the Kremlin\u2019s narratives, and has twice sided with Russia in votes at the UN Security Council that marked the third anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A\u00a0bilateral meeting between US and Russian teams\u00a0has led to concern that both European and Ukrainian partners could be cut out of future negotiations. In parallel, the US has halted efforts to seize Russian oligarchs\u2019 assets and has shut down a federal initiative targeting foreign influence campaigns, while the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has reportedly ordered the US Cyber Command to slow offensive cyber-operations against\u00a0Russia.Recent decisions from the US have added new urgency to\u00a0Europe\u2019s efforts to support Ukraine\u00a0and review its transatlantic reliance on defence, but any spending uplift will take time to be effective.\u00a0The UK and France have said that they are ready to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine after European leaders outlined a\u00a0four-point strategy.",
    "Germany\u2019s incoming government\u00a0plans to exempt defence spending from the country\u2019s constitutionally enshrined \u201cdebt brake\u201d, enabling hundreds of billions in additional spending.",
    "The European Commission has announced several initiatives, including a new \u20ac150bn defence procurement loan package to EU governments to bolster their domestic defence sectors.\u00a0Overall, since the start of the invasion, the US has provided \u20ac64bn (US$66bn) in military aid to Ukraine, while Europe has provided \u20ac62bn. In 2024 the US support accounted for \u20ac20bn out of a total \u20ac42bn in military aid, meaning the US contribution was equal to just 0.12% of EU GDP. However, European defence efforts will continue to struggle with insufficient co-ordination and infrastructure, logistical difficulties in scaling up quickly, and continued reliance on the US for both intelligence and essential equipment.Russia is unlikely to be able to take advantage of the spending freeze immediately. The Russian military is currently severely weakened, despite temporary measures such as deploying\u00a0North Korean conscripts to Kursk, the Ukrainian-controlled enclave in Russia, and offering increased pay to attract more troops. The loss of Russian armoured vehicles is also significant, and Russia is probably running short of Soviet supplies previously in storage, which it has been upgrading. In Toretsk, an industrial city in Donetsk that has endured months of intense battles, Ukrainian forces have launched a successful counteroffensive against Russian troops, and Russian progress in recent months has been slow and extremely costly. That said,\u00a0the longer the aid freeze continues, the more the Russian forces may be able to benefit.What next?The suspension of US material assistance is a serious blow to Ukraine, intended to force Mr\u00a0Zelenskyi back to the negotiating table. To judge from Mr\u00a0Zelenskyi\u2019s climb-down on March\u00a04th\u2013emphasising his desire to mend relations, and willingness to sign a deal granting the US access to Ukrainian minerals\u2013this has worked.\u00a0Our expectation is that the US and Ukraine will sign the critical minerals deal, which is an initial step towards peace negotiations.\u00a0However, Mr Trump\u2019s willingness to exert maximum pressure on Ukraine, and his conciliatory stance towards Russia, underpins our forecast that the end result will be a weak peace deal in the second half of 2025, with Ukraine\u00a0forced to make significant territorial concessions, with only flimsy security guarantees\u00a0that are insufficient to discount the risk of future Russian aggression.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
