Foreign businesses can use their outsider status to their advantage when entering new markets instead of trying to assimilate with the local environment. Many companies encounter difficulties such as cultural differences, credibility issues, and resource limitations when expanding internationally. However, embracing foreignness can lead to significant growth in these markets. For instance, multinational firms can capitalize on their outsider status by diverging from local norms or building strategic alliances with local players who also want to expand globally. Among the successful examples of such a strategy include Sequoia Capital in China, which associated itself with prominent figures from Silicon Valley, and LinkedIn, which formed a strategic partnership with WeChat to attract users in China. The article advises companies to adopt a nuanced approach that leverages their foreignness to not only navigate but thrive in unfamiliar markets.
