    "Early next year, Google and its partners plan to launch the first in a series of satellites that together would provide close-up, frequently refreshed images of wildfires around the world, offering data that could help firefighters battle blazes more rapidly, effectively, and safely. The online search giant\u2019s nonprofit and research arms have collaborated with the Moore Foundation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the satellite company Muon Space, and others to deploy 52 satellites equipped with custom-developed sensors over the coming years.\u00a0  The FireSat satellites will be able to spot fires as small as 5 by 5 meters (16 by 16 feet) on any speck of the globe. Once the full constellation is in place, the system should be capable of updating those images about every 20 minutes, the group says. Those capabilities together would mark a significant upgrade over what\u2019s available from the satellites that currently provide data to fire agencies. Generally, they can provide either high-resolution images that aren\u2019t updated rapidly enough to track fires closely or frequently refreshed images that are relatively low-resolution.",
    "The Earth Fire Alliance collaboration will also leverage Google\u2019s AI wildfire tools, which have been trained to detect early indications of wildfires and track their progression, to draw additional insights from the data. Related StoryCanada\u2019s 2023 wildfires produced more emissions than fossil fuels in most countriesIf they were a country they\u2019d rank as the fourth-highest emitter, behind only China, the US, and India.",
    "The images and analysis will be provided free to fire agencies around the world, helping to improve understanding of where fires are, where they\u2019re moving, and how hot they\u2019re burning. The information could help agencies stamp out small fires before they turn into raging infernos, place limited firefighting resources where they\u2019ll do the most good, and evacuate people along the safest paths.",
    "\u201cIn the satellite image of the Earth, a lot of things can be mistaken for a fire: a glint, a hot roof, smoke from another fire,\u201d says Chris Van Arsdale, climate and energy research lead at Google Research and chairman of the Earth Fire Alliance. \u201cDetecting fires becomes a game of looking for needles in a world of haystacks. Solving this will enable first responders to act quickly and precisely when a fire is detected.\u201d Some details of FireSat were unveiled earlier this year. But the organizations involved will announce additional information about their plans today, including the news that Google.org, the company\u2019s charitable arm, has provided $13 million to the program and that the inaugural launch is scheduled to occur next year.\u00a0 Reducing the fog of war The news comes as large fires rage across millions of acres in the western US, putting people and property at risk. The blazes include the Line Fire in Southern California, the Shoe Fly Fire in central Oregon, and the Davis Fire south of Reno, Nevada. Wildfires have become more frequent, extreme, and dangerous in recent decades. That, in part, is a consequence of climate change: Rising temperatures suck the moisture from trees, shrubs, and grasses. But fires increasingly contribute to global warming as well. A recent study found that the fires that scorched millions of acres across Canada last year pumped out 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide, four times the annual pollution produced by the airline industry.  GOOGLE   Humans have also increased fire risk by suppressing natural fires for decades, which has allowed fuel to build up in forests and grasslands, and by constructing communities on the edge of wilderness boundaries without appropriate rules, materials, and safeguards.\u00a0 Observers say that FireSat could play an important role in combating fires, both by enabling fire agencies to extinguish small ones before they grow into large ones and by informing effective strategies for battling them once they\u2019re crossed that point. \u201cWhat these satellites will do is reduce the fog of war,\u201d says Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment, who is focused on fire policy issues. \u201cLike when a situation is really dynamic and very dangerous for firefighters and they\u2019re trying to make decisions very quickly about whether to move in to defend structures or try to evacuate people.\u201d\u00a0 (Wara serves on the advisory board of the Moore Foundation's Wildfire Resilience Initiative.)Some areas, like California, already have greater visibility into the current state of fires or early signs of outbreaks, thanks to technology like Department of Defense satellites, remote camera networks, and planes, helicopters, and drones. But FireSat will be especially helpful for \u201ccountries that have less-well-resourced wildland fighting capability,\u201d Wara adds.",
    "Better images, more data, and AI will not be able to fully counter the increased fire dangers. Wara and other fire experts argue that regions need to use prescribed burns and other efforts to more aggressively reduce the buildup of fuel, rethink where and how we build communities in fire-prone areas, and do more to fund and support the work of firefighters on the ground.\u00a0 Sounding an earlier alarm for fires will only help reduce dangers when regions have, or develop, the added firefighting resources needed to combat the most dangerous ones quickly and effectively. Communities will also need to put in place better policies to determine what types of fires should be left to burn, and under what conditions. \u2018A game changer\u2019 Kate Dargan Marquis, a senior wildfire advisor to the Moore Foundation who previously served as state fire marshal for California, says she can \u201cpersonally attest\u201d to the difference that such tools will make to firefighters in the field. \u201cIt is a game changer, especially as wildfires are becoming more extreme, more frequent, and more dangerous for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cInformation like this will make a lifesaving difference for firefighters and communities around the globe.\u201d  Kate Dargan Marquis, senior advisor, Moore Foundation.GOOGLE   Google Research developed the sensors for the satellite and tested them as well as the company\u2019s AI fire detection models by conducting flights over controlled burns in California. Google intends to work with Earth Fire Alliance \u201cto ensure AI can help make this data as useful as possible, and also that wildfire information is shared as widely as possible,\u201d the company said. Google\u2019s Van Arsdale says that providing visual images of every incident around the world from start to finish will be enormously valuable to scientists studying wildfires and climate change.\u00a0 \u201cWe can combine this data with Google\u2019s existing models of the Earth to help advance our understanding of fire behavior and fire dynamics across all of Earth\u2019s ecosystems,\u201d he says. \u201cAll this together really has the potential to help mitigate the environmental and social impact of fire while also improving people\u2019s health and safety.\u201d Specifically, it could improve assessments of fire risk, as well as our understanding of the most effective means of preventing or slowing the spread of fires. For instance, it could help communities determine where it would be most cost-effective to remove trees and underbrush.",
    "Figuring out the best ways to conduct such interventions is another key goal of the program, given their high cost and the limited funds available for managing wildlands, says Genny Biggs, the program director for the Moore Foundation\u2019s Wildfire Resilience Initiative. The launch The idea for FireSat grew out of a series of meetings that began with a 2019 workshop hosted by the Moore Foundation, which provided the first philanthropic funding for the program.",
    "The first satellite, scheduled to be launched aboard a SpaceX rocket early next year, will be fully functional aside from some data transmission features. The goals of the \u201cprotoflight\u201d mission include testing the onboard systems and the data they send back. The Earth Fire Alliance will work with a handful of early-adopter agencies to prepare for the next phases.\u00a0 The group intends to launch three fully operational satellites in 2026, with additional deployments in the years that follow. Muon Space will build and operate the satellites.\u00a0 Agencies around the world should be able to receive hourly wildfire updates once about half of the constellation is operational, says Brian Collins, executive director of the Earth Fire Alliance. It hopes to launch all 52 satellites by around the end of this decade. Each satellite is designed to last about five years, so the organization will eventually need to deploy 10 more each year to maintain the constellation. The Earth Fire Alliance has secured about two-thirds of the funding it needs for the first phase of the program, which includes the first four launches. The organization will need to raise additional money from government agencies, international organizations, philanthropies, and other groups\u00a0 to deploy, maintain, and operate the full constellation. It estimates the total cost will exceed $400 million, which Collins notes \u201cis 1/1000th of the economic losses due to extreme wildfires annually in the US alone.\u201d Asked if commercial uses of the data could also support the program, including potentially military ones, Collins said in an email: \u201cAdjacent applications range from land use management and agriculture to risk management and industrial impact and mitigation.\u201d",
    "\u201cAt the same time, we know that as large agencies and government agencies adopt FireSat data to support a broad public safety mandate, they may develop all-hazard, emergenc[y] management, and security related uses of data,\u201d he added. \u201cAs long as opportunities are in balance with our charter to advance a global approach to wildfire and climate resilience, we welcome new ideas and applications of our data.\u201d \u2018Living with fire\u2019 A wide variety of startups have emerged in recent years promising to use technology to reduce the frequency and severity of wildfires\u2014for example, by installing cameras and sensors in forests and grasslands, developing robots to carry out controlled burns, deploying autonomous helicopters that can drop suppressant, and harnessing AI to predict wildfire behavior and inform forest and fire management strategies.\u00a0 So far, even with all these new tools, it\u2019s still been difficult for communities to keep pace with the rising dangers. Dargan Marquis\u2014who founded her own wildfire software company, Intterra\u2014says she is confident the incidence of disastrous fires can be meaningfully reduced with programs like FireSat, along with other improved technologies and policies. But she says it\u2019s likely to take decades to catch up with the growing risks, as the world continues warming up. \u201cWe're going to struggle in places like California, these Mediterranean climates around the world, while our technology and our capabilities and our inventions, etc., catch up with that level of the problem,\u201d she says.\u00a0 \u201cWe can turn that corner,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf we work together on a comprehensive strategy with the right data and a convincing plan over the next 50 years, I do think that by the end of the century, we absolutely can be living with fire.\u201d hide"
