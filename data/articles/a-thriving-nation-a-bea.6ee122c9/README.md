*01:28 AM, Tuesday, December 31, 2024*

As 2024 approaches its conclusion, December 31st stands as a noteworthy marker—the President’s first hundred days in office. However, this milestone cannot be conflated with the first hundred days of the JVP/NPP government, given that the new parliament has been in session for only 49 days as of this date. This dual timeline encapsulates the intricate and evolving dynamics of Sri Lanka’s political landscape.

The completion of the President’s first hundred days is a symbolic milestone, offering insights into his leadership style and priorities. However, governance is a continuum—one shaped as much by inherited challenges as by new initiatives. While the first hundred days provide a foundation, the true measure of success lies in the administration’s capacity to address long-term issues and deliver sustained progress.

As Sri Lanka transitions into a new year, the journey ahead is laden with both challenges and opportunities. The milestones achieved thus far, though modest, serve as stepping stones toward a broader vision of national renewal and prosperity. The coming months will test the resilience, adaptability, and commitment of the President, the legislature, and the nation as a whole. The period between the President’s inauguration and the convening of the new parliament underscores the challenges of navigating a transition of power. During this interim phase, the President grappled with the dual responsibilities of ensuring continuity in governance and preparing to establish a unified administration, all while anticipating a parliamentary majority that aligns with the electorate’s will. This delay highlights the procedural and political obstacles that are emblematic of Sri Lanka’s deeply divided political landscape.

Despite these challenges, the President has taken a pragmatic stance, prioritising immediate concerns such as tackling economic instability, fostering national reconciliation, and optimising administrative processes. While these efforts are commendable, their impact had been constrained by the absence of a fully operational legislative body for a significant portion of this period. Without parliamentary backing, the scope for enacting transformative policies has been inevitably curtailed, highlighting the difficulties of navigating governance amid institutional delays.

The convening of the new parliament 49 days ago has injected new energy into the political arena. The JVP/NPP, known for its ideologically driven platform, now faces the task of translating its vision into actionable governance. This moment represents a critical juncture for the administration, providing an opportunity to synchronise executive objectives with legislative initiatives. However, achieving effective governance will necessitate bridging ideological divides, fostering bipartisan collaboration, and ensuring that the focus remains on national interests rather than partisan agendas.

Wickremesinghe’s Perspective on National Recovery

In a notable move, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called on the SJB-led Opposition to act responsibly by supporting the continuation of the IMF bailout programme. This appeal comes at a critical moment, as the NPP government’s adherence to the IMF programme remains a cornerstone of its economic strategy. Wickremesinghe’s recognition of the programme’s significance and his appeal for bipartisan collaboration highlight the necessity of sound policymaking and collective effort to drive national recovery. His stance underscores that economic stability transcends political divides and requires unified action.  The Ex-President, though often criticised for his unpopularity and perceived lack of charisma, played a pivotal role in initiating the IMF programme during his presidency. His tenure was marked by difficult but necessary decisions, laying a foundation upon which the current administration can build. While his recent exhortation carries an undertone of political self-promotion, it also reflects his deep understanding of the economic challenges facing Sri Lanka. His emphasis on responsible governance and continuity highlights the interconnectedness of successive administrations in navigating national crises.

Throughout this transitional phase, Sri Lanka’s armed forces have continued to uphold their role as a stabilising presence. Their steadfast loyalty to the nation’s democratic framework, regardless of which political party is in power, has been instrumental in maintaining institutional stability. This commitment underscores the resilience of Sri Lanka’s constitutional safeguards and provides a vital foundation for the country’s governance during periods of political flux.

As the nation looks forward to 2025, the interplay between the executive and legislative branches will be pivotal. The President’s ability to navigate these dynamics, build consensus, and drive policy implementation will be critical in shaping public confidence in his leadership. The new parliament’s role will also be under scrutiny, particularly its capacity to function as a productive and cooperative legislative body. The expectations of the Sri Lankan people remain high. With economic recovery, social cohesion, and transparent governance at the forefront of public concerns, the administration must demonstrate tangible progress to meet these aspirations. The JVP/NPP government, though nascent, carries the weight of significant public hope for systemic change and accountability.

The SJB, however, has chosen a populist route, advocating for the renegotiation of the IMF agreement. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has expressed concerns over the 2028 debt repayment timeline, warning of potential default risks. While Premadasa has assured conditional support to the government in renegotiation efforts, the SJB’s internal disarray raises questions about its credibility and capacity to influence international financial institutions.

The IMF programme has provided crucial stability to Sri Lanka’s economy, acting as a lifeline amid years of fiscal mismanagement and political instability. The Mahinda Rajapaksa government’s ambitious projects, excessive borrowing under Yahapalana, and tax cuts during Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidency worsened the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic and Easter Sunday attacks further deepened the situation. While the IMF’s conditions are unpopular, they offer a path to short-term recovery and long-term sustainability, which Sri Lanka must follow with discipline and resolve.

President Dissanayake’s leadership in these early days has been a blend of promising initiatives and unmet expectations. His inaugural address to Parliament set a constructive tone, emphasising continuity in economic policies and a compact cabinet structure. His first official visit to India demonstrated deft diplomacy with Sri Lanka’s influential neighbour. Yet, public sentiment remains focused on the rising cost of living and shortages of essential goods, including rice, coconuts, fuel, and electricity. While the government has introduced measures such as reduced fuel prices, it has yet to deliver substantial relief to the populace. The promises of fairness and order in the distribution of essential goods, which were central to the NPP’s election campaign, have yet to materialise fully.

One of the pressing concerns is the plight of the elderly. During his campaign, President Dissanayake pledged to restore the 15% senior citizen’s interest rate and address the indignities faced by the elderly, such as long queues for allowances and abandonment. These promises resonate with a populace eager for compassionate governance. The government’s commitment to rapid responses for overcoming these challenges will be critical in shaping public opinion and trust.

The controversy surrounding Speaker Asoka Ranwala’s falsified academic credentials has distracted from the NPP government’s agenda. While his actions have drawn criticism, they do not define the NPP’s potential. This situation offers President Dissanayake’s government an opportunity to address ethical lapses decisively. By holding Ranwala accountable and taking transparent actions, the administration can reinforce its commitment to good governance, signalling that accountability and integrity are its priorities. Addressing this issue fairly and clearly can help restore public trust and prevent isolated controversies from overshadowing broader policy goals.
