Prema Cooray, a leader of the travel industry as well as the Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, passed away last week, leaving a significant imprint on the sectors of environment conservation and eco-friendly productivity. He is known for directing the PEP (Promotion of Eco-efficient Productivity) Project, an initiative supported by the Dutch government that inspired private Sri Lankan businesses to adopt sustainable practices, including cleaner production and the use of environmentally friendly technologies. The PEP also gave businesses the opportunity to explore bio-mass/Dendro energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. In total, 55 project proposals were approved, with 51 completed by early 2009. The writer stresses that Cooray's drive and versatility in leading different initiatives were crucial to his success.
