    "What\u2019s happened?After 61 years in power, the Baathist regime in Syria has fallen, following a swift offensive by a coalition of rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a Salafi armed organisation based in Idlib. The president, Bashar al-Assad, reportedly fled the country on December\u00a08th, as Arab and Druze militias from the Daraa and Suwayda provinces advanced into country\u2019s capital, Damascus, from the south. In the aftermath of the regime\u2019s collapse, HTS and its allies have appointed Mohammed al-Bashir, the leader of the Idlib\u2019s HTS-run National Salvation Government, as the new prime minister of Syria. He is expected to establish a transitional government, probably based on the principles outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\u00a0Even as a transitional government is formed, we remain highly sceptical about the new government\u2019s ability to function effectively and cohesively, given limited resources and internal conflicts among the various rebel factions. Political and economic risks are expected to remain elevated in the medium\u00a0term.Why does it matter?The collaboration among key rebel factions in their recent offensive against the Assad regime indicates a strong alignment of shared goals, which could positively influence the formation of a new government in the near future.\u00a0HTS is likely to gain the support of local Arab militias, Druze groups, diverse rebel factions \u2014including the US-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA)\u2014 and the Turkish-supported Syrian National Army (SNA). This coalition could provide a solid foundation for establishing a unity government. Concerns about HTS\u2019s extreme Islamist ideology and its declared intention to establish an Islamic government in Syria are diminishing, at least for the time being. HTS\u2019s leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Jolani, has been working to rebrand the group, fostering co-operation with various Christian, Alawite, Druze and other\u00a0groups.Nonetheless, any prospective government will encounter immediate economic and political challenges that will put its authority and stability to the test.\u00a0Ongoing\u00a0clashes between the Arab-dominated rebel coalition and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) present a significant risk.\u00a0The SNA, bolstered by direct military support from Turkey, has initiated attacks on SDF positions following the regime\u2019s collapse, including a ground offensive aimed at reclaiming the strategic city of Manbij. This situation could escalate into broader confrontations in northern Syria. In addition, unresolved issues regarding Kurdish autonomy and control over Syria\u2019s oil resources will heighten tensions between any new government and Turkey on one side and the SDF and its US backers on the\u00a0other.In the absence of a common adversary, deeper strategic and ideological rifts within the rebel coalition are likely to emerge.\u00a0There is a high risk that HTS, capitalising on its military dominance and political influence, will attempt to monopolise the political transition and the formation of the government for its own purposes. Internal pressure may arise from HTS\u2019s members and its close allies, such as the jihadi Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, to establish an Islamic state. This shift will alienate non-Muslim factions and secular rebel groups, such as the\u00a0FSA.The ideological aspirations of HTS will also exacerbate Syria\u2019s ongoing international isolation, a situation worsened by years of Western sanctions.\u00a0This isolation poses immediate challenges for any new government concerning financing, trade and currency stability.\u00a0Given that HTS is classified as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and other Western nations, and faces opposition from the UAE, Iran and other significant regional players, we do not expect any substantial financial or humanitarian aid inflows from the international community in the near future. This challenge may deepen existing internal divisions among religious and ethnically based rebel factions as they strive to satisfy their respective support bases in the face of dwindling resources.What next?As a new transitional government is established, probably structured along confessional and ethnic lines, we expect significant challenges in addressing the diverse interests of Syria\u2019s competing factions.\u00a0This struggle is highly likely to result in a prolonged period of political and economic instability. Although there are currently positive indicators stemming from the recent unity among the rebel groups, the overwhelming expectations placed on the new government, coupled with the numerous challenges it confronts, are likely to hinder its effectiveness. This situation may lead to recurring instances of in-fighting among the various armed factions within the country.The analysis and forecasts presented in this article are drawn from\u00a0EIU\u2019s\u00a0Country Analysis\u00a0service.
