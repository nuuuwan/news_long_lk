If you’re interested in forming a union, but unsure of what to expect, you’re not alone. Under the current American system for union recognition, unionizing is an arduous process and comes with some real challenges. It takes extensive organization among coworkers and differs for those in the private vs. the public sector. For those who work in the private sector, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) oversees the process of certification. It often — but not always — involves an NLRB-supervised election, where workers vote over whether they want to be represented by a particular union. Having some foundational knowledge around why unions form, what they do, and how they’re structured can help inform how you navigate this process.

Interest among the American workforce in unions has increased significantly in the past five years. Our own survey of more than 2,500 frontline U.S. workers finds that younger respondents (ages 30 and under) are especially open to unionization. In fact, this group has already put their views into action. Nearly all union growth in 2023 (229,000 new members) came from workers under the age of 45.
