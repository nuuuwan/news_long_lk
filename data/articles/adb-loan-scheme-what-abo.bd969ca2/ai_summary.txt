Sri Lanka's construction industry is requesting that the government include them in the concessional loan scheme provided by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) to alleviate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on small and medium scale businesses. The government has asked international financial institutions to supply subsidised financial assistance to revive businesses hit by the pandemic, leading the ADB to provide Rs. 20 billion via commercial banks at lower interest rates. The construction industry, which contributes significantly to the nation's economy, has asked that their small and medium businesses also be allowed to receive loans under this scheme. About 80% of Sri Lanka's construction industry is made up of micro, small and medium enterprises. With this loan, halted construction work can resume, restoring employment and normalcy to many people's lives.
