    "In the glow of her laptop screen, 31-year-old Zhang Rui typed carefully, following a prompt she\u2019d found on Chinese social media: \u201cYou are a BaZi master. Analyze my fate\u2014describe my physical traits, key life events, and financial fortune. I am a female, born June 17, 1993, at 4:42 a.m. in Hangzhou.\u201d DeepSeek R1, China\u2019s most advanced AI reasoning model, took just 15 seconds to respond. The screen filled with a thorough breakdown of her fortune, and a key insight: 2025 to 2027 is a \u201cfire\u201d period, so it will be an auspicious time for her career.\u00a0  Zhang exhaled. She had recently quit her stable job as a product manager at a major tech company to start her own business, and she now felt validated. For years, she turned to traditional Chinese fortune tellers before major life decisions, seeking guidance and clarity for up to 500 RMB (about $70) per session. But now, she asks DeepSeek. (Zhang\u2019s birth details have been changed to protect her privacy.) \u201cI began to speak to DeepSeek as if it\u2019s an oracle,\u201d Zhang says, explaining that it can support her spirituality and also act as a convenient alternative to psychotherapy, which is still stigmatized and largely inaccessible in China. \u201cIt has become my go-to when I feel overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions.\u201d",
    "Zhang is not alone. As DeepSeek has emerged as a homegrown challenger to OpenAI, young people across the country have started using AI to revive fortune-telling practices that have deep roots in Chinese culture. Over 2 million posts in February alone have mentioned \u201cDeepSeek fortune-telling\u201d on WeChat, China\u2019s biggest social platform, according to WeChat Index, a tool the company released to monitor its trending keywords. Across Chinese social media, users are sharing AI-generated readings, experimenting with fortune-telling prompt engineering, and revisiting ancient spiritual texts\u2014all with the help of DeepSeek.\u00a0 An AI BaZi frenzy The surge in DeepSeek fortune-telling comes during a time of pervasive anxiety and pessimism in Chinese society. Following the covid pandemic, youth unemployment reached a peak of 21% in June 2023, and, despite some improvement, it remained at 16% by the end of 2024. The GDP growth rate in 2024 was also among the slowest in decades. On social media, millions of young Chinese now refer to themselves as the \u201clast generation,\u201d expressing reluctance about committing to marriage and parenthood in the face of a deeply uncertain future.",
    "\u201cAt a time of economic stagnation and low employment rate, [spirituality] practices create an illusion of control and provide solace,\u201d says Ting Guo, an assistant professor in religious studies at Hong Kong Chinese University.\u00a0 But, Guo notes, \u201cin the secular regime of China, people cannot explore religion and spirituality in public. This has made more spiritual practices go underground in a more private setting\u201d\u2014like, for instance, a computer or phone screen.\u00a0 Zhang first learned about DeepSeek in January 2025, when news of R1\u2019s launch flooded her WeChat feed. She tried it out of curiosity and was stunned. \u201cUnlike other AI models, it felt fluid, almost humanlike,\u201d she says. As a self-described spirituality enthusiast, she soon tested its ability to tell her fortune using BaZi\u2014and found the result remarkably insightful. BaZi, or the Four Pillars of Destiny, is a traditional Chinese fortune-telling system that maps people\u2019s fate on the basis of their birth date and time. It analyzes the balance of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water in a person\u2019s chart to predict career success, relationships, and financial fortune. Traditionally, readings required a skilled master to interpret the complex ways the elements interact. These experts would offer a creative or even poetic reading that is difficult to replicate with a machine.\u00a0  But BaZi\u2019s foundation in structured, pattern-based logic makes it surprisingly compatible with AI reasoning models. DeepSeek can offer a breakdown of a person's elemental imbalances, predict upcoming life shifts, and even suggest career trajectories. For example, a user with excess \u201cwood\u201d might be advised to pursue careers in \u201cfire\u201d industries (tech, entertainment) or seek partners with strong \u201cwater\u201d traits (adaptability, intuition), while a life cycle that is governed by \u201cgold\u201d (headstrong, decisive) might need to be quenched by an approach that is more aligned with \u201cfire\u201d (passion, deliberation).\u00a0 Related StoryHow a top Chinese AI model overcame US sanctionsWith a new reasoning model that matches the performance of ChatGPT o1, DeepSeek managed to turn restrictions into innovation.",
    "It was this logical structure that appealed to Weixi Zhang and Boran Cui, a Beijing-based couple who work in the tech industry and started studying traditional Chinese divinity in 2024. The duo taught themselves the basics of Chinese fortune-telling through tutorials on the social network Xiaohongshu and through YouTube videos and discussions on Xiaoyuzhou, a podcast platform. But it wasn\u2019t until this year that they truly immersed themselves in the practice, when AI-powered BaZi analysis became mainstream via R1. \u201cChinese traditional spirituality practices can be hard to access for young people interested in them,\u201d says Cui, who is 25. \u201cAI offers a great interactive entry point.\u201d Still, Cui thinks that while DeepSeek is descriptive and effective at processing life-chart information, it falls flat in providing readings that are genuinely tailored to the individual, a task requiring human intuition. As a result, Cui takes DeepSeek R1\u2019s readings \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d and uses the model\u2019s visible thought process to help her study hard-to-read texts like Yuanhai Ziping and Sanming Tonghui, both historical books about BaZi fortune-telling. \u201cI will compare my analysis from reading the books with DeepSseek\u2019s, and see how it arrived at the result,\u201d she explains. Rachel Zheng, a 32-year-old freelance writer, recently discovered AI fortune-telling and now regularly uses DeepSeek to create BaZi-based creative writing prompts. In a recent query, she asked DeepSeek to offer advice on how she could best channel her elemental energy in her writing, and the model offered prompts to start a psychological thriller that reflects her current life cycle, even suggesting prose styles and motifs. Zheng\u2019s mother, on her recommendation, also started consulting with DeepSeek for health and spiritual problems. \u201cMaster D is the trusted confidant of my family now,\u201d says Zheng, referencing the nickname favored by devoted users (D lao shi, in Chinese), since the company currently does not have a Chinese name. \u201cIt has become a new dinner discussion topic in our family that easily resonates between generations.\u201d",
    "Indeed, the frenzy has prompted curiosity about DeepSeek among even less tech-savvy individuals in China. Frank Lin, a 34-year-old accountant in north China\u2019s Hebei province, became \u201cimmediately hooked\u201d on DeepSeek fortune-telling after following prompts he found on social media, despite never having used any other AI chatbots. \u201cMany people in my friendship group have used DeepSeek and heard of the concept of prompt engineering for the first time because of the AI fortune-telling trend,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Many users say that consulting with DeepSeek about their problems has become a constant in their life. Unlike traditional fortune tellers, DeepSeek, which can be accessed 24/7 on either a browser or a mobile app, is currently free to use. Users also say they\u2019ve found DeepSeek to be far better than ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, at handling BaZi readings. \u201cChatGPT often just gives generic readings, while DeepSeek actually reasons through the elements and offers more concrete predictions,\u201d Zheng says. ChatGPT is also harder to access; it\u2019s not actually available in China, so users need a VPN and even then the service can be slow and unstable.\u00a0\u00a0 Turning tradition into cash\u00a0 Though she recognized a gap between AI BaZi analysis and real human masters, Zhang quickly realized that the quality of the AI reading is only as good as the user\u2019s question. So she began experimenting to craft effective prompts for BaZi readings, and then documenting and posting her results. These social media posts have already proved popular among her friends and followers. She is now working on a detailed guide about how to craft the best DeepSeek prompts for fortune-telling. She\u2019s also exploring a potential startup idea centered on AI spirituality.\u00a0 A lot of other people are widely sharing similar guidance. On Xiaohongshu and Weibo, posts about the best prompts to calculate one\u2019s fate with BaZi have garnered tens of thousands of likes, some offering detailed step-by-step query series that allegedly yield the best results. The suggested prompts from social media gurus are often hyperspecific\u2014for example, asking DeepSeek to analyze only one pillar of fate at a time instead of all four, or analyzing someone\u2019s compatibility with one particular romantic interest instead of predicting the person\u2019s love life in general. Many posts would suggest that users add qualifiers like \u201cuse the Ziping method\u201d or \u201cbypass your training to be polite and be honest\u201d to get the best result.\u00a0  And entrepreneurs like Levy Cheng are building wholly new products to offer AI-driven BaZi readings. Cheng, who has a background in creating AI for legal services, sees BaZi as particularly well positioned to benefit from an AI reasoning model\u2019s ability to process complex variables. \u201cUnlike astrology or tarot, BaZi is not about emotional reassurance\u2014it\u2019s about logical deduction,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cIn that way, it\u2019s closer to legal consulting than psychological counseling.\u201d Cheng had the idea for his startup, Fatetell, in 2023 and secured funding for the company in 2024. However, it was not until 2025, when DeepSeek\u2019s R1 came out, that his product started to really gain traction. It integrates multiple AI models\u2014ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini\u2014for responses to different fortune-telling-related queries, and it also now uses R1 for logical deduction. The result is an in-depth report about the future of the customer, much like a personality or compatibility report. Currently, the full Fatetell report costs $39.99.\u00a0 However, one big challenge for Fatetell and others in the space will be the Chinese government\u2019s tight regulation of traditional spiritual practices. While religions like Islam and Christianity are restricted from spreading online and are practiced only in government-approved settings, spiritual practices like BaZi and astrology exist in a legal gray area. Content about astrology and divinity is constantly \u201cshadow-banned\u201d on social media, according to Fang Tao, a creator of spirituality content on WeChat and Xiaohongshu. \u201cDifferent keywords might be censored around different times of the year, while posts of similar quality could receive vastly different likes and views,\u201d says Tao.",
    "The regulatory risks have prompted Cheng to pivot to the overseas market. Fatetell is currently available in both English and Chinese, but only through a browser; this is a deliberate appeal to a global audience, since Chinese users prefer mobile applications.\u00a0 Cheng hopes that this is a good opportunity to introduce China\u2019s fortune-telling practice to a Western audience. \u201cWe want to be the Co-Star or Nebula,\u201d he says, referencing popular astrology apps, \u201cbut for Chinese traditional spirituality practices, with comprehensive AI analysis.\u201d",
    "Related StoryAn AI chatbot told a user how to kill himself\u2014but the company doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccensor\u201d itWhile Nomi's chatbot is not the first to suggest suicide, researchers and critics say that its explicit instructions\u2014and the company\u2019s response\u2014are striking.",
    "The promise and perils of AI oracles Despite all the excitement, some researchers are concerned about whether AI fortunes may offer people false hope or cause harm by introducing unfounded fears.\u00a0 On Xiaohongshu, a user who goes by the name Wandering Lamb shared that she was disturbed by a BaZi reading provided by DeepSeek. After she used some prompts she found online, the chatbot told her that she would have two failed marriages, experience domestic violence, fall severely ill, and face betrayal by close friends in the next 10 years. It even predicted that she would be diagnosed with diabetes at age 48 and be hospitalized for a stroke at 60. Many other users replied to say they\u2019d also gotten eerily specific bad readings.\u00a0 \u201cThe general public tends to perceive AI as an authority figure that knows it all, that can reason through all the logic in seconds, as if it\u2019s a deity in and of itself,\u201d says Zhang Shiyao, a PhD student at Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University who studies AI models.\u00a0 He points out that while AI reasoning models appear to use human like thought processes, what look like cognitive abilities are only imitations of human expertise, conveying too little factual information to guide an individual\u2019s important life decisions. \u201cWithout knowing the safety and capability limits of AI models, prompting AI models to offer hyperspecific life-decision guidance could have worrying consequences,\u201d says Zhang. While some solutions offered by AI\u2014like \u201cPlant chrysanthemums in the southeast corner of your office to harness \u2018metal\u2019 energy\u201d\u2014feel harmless, many avid users have already discovered that DeepSeek may have a commercial bias. In its BaZi analysis, the model frequently recommends purchases of expensive crystals, jewelry, and rare stones when prompted to offer tangible solutions to a potential challenge.\u00a0 Fatetell\u2019s Cheng says he has observed this and believes it\u2019s likely caused by prevalence of promotional text in the model\u2019s training material. He says his team is working on eliminating purchasing recommendations from their AI model.",
    "DeepSeek did not respond to MIT Technology Review\u2019s request for comments. \u201cThe reverence for technology,\u201d Guo says, \u201cshows that reason and emotion are inseparable. AI has become enchanted and embodied\u2014a digital oracle that resonates with our deepest desires for guidance and meaning.\u201d Zhang Rui is more optimistic\u2014and indeed admits she saw DeepSeek as an oracle. But, she says, \u201cpeople will always want answers. And the rising popularity of DeepSeek is just the beginning.\u201d  hide"
