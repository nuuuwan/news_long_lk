Facts:

- The three leading political camps—the President Ranil Wickremesinghe-led Government, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and the National People’s Power (NPP)—are converging on two key issues: an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led economic recovery, and the continuity of the Provincial Councils (PC) system.
- The SJB and the NPP, both opposition parties, argue that they would negotiate the Government’s IMF deal to more favorable terms for the poorer sections of society.
- President Wickremesinghe, SJB and NPP have all made commitments to implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which involves power sharing through PCs.
- At the 2020 general elections, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Government sought a mandate to abolish PCs under a new Constitution.
- NPP's recent commitment to continuing the PC system is an important shift in the party’s position.
- In 2022, an economic crisis led the NPP to endorse an IMF-led path as the only solution, marking a drastic change in the party's position.
- The People’s Struggle Alliance, launched on 19 June, includes the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP), and several other individual activists and professionals. They characterized their agenda as ‘radical, left progressive’.
- Other recent political developments suggest increasing contestations and bargains among the elites, including the judiciary.

Opinions:

- The convergences among the three leading political camps reflect consensus on the liberal economy and liberal peace.
- The NPP's shift in position over the PC system is likely motivated by a need to appeal to a broader electorate, including the Tamil minority vote.
- Policy convergence on economic recovery and the ethnic issue is reminiscent of governance during President Chandrika Kumaratunga Bandaranaike’s first term (1994-1999), where a liberal consensus was reached.
- The ultra-nationalist and ultra-left positions taken by fringe parties like Sarvajana Balaya and People’s Struggle Alliance are expected to only secure a marginal vote.
- Public contestations suggest that the President is trying to overpower the judiciary and create a precedent for parliamentary overriding of the judiciary.
- The emerging liberal consensus among mainstream parties in Sri Lanka may likely decide the outcomes during this electoral cycle, while the fringe parties show potential for shaping the mainstream narratives significantly.
