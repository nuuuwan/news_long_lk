Ratnayake cited several incidents, including the post-election violence of 1977, the burning of the Jaffna library in 1981, and the 1983 riots, as reasons for which Wickremesinghe should have been held accountable during his time in Government.

The minister also brought up the deaths of over 60,000 people between 1987 and 1990 and the ongoing Batalanda torture house investigation.

He further noted that despite his alleged involvement in the 2015 bond scam, no arrest was made.

Ratnayake concluded by asserting that the current government is now allowing investigating officers to perform their duties with integrity and without hindrance.
