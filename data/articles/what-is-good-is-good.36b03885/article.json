    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake greeting the invitees at the 78th Independence Day celebration",
    "Reflections on President\u2019s Independence Day address",
    "In August 1990, I had the privilege of listening live to the National Day speech of Lee Kuan Yew. He spoke not in slogans, but in clear, practical terms. He spoke of strong defence, disciplined governance, economic self-reliance, and even future challenges he anticipated decades ahead, along with solutions already in motion. That speech exemplified leadership rooted in vision, planning, and execution\u2014not rhetoric",
    "Nations that emerged from colonial rule commemorate their Independence in different ways. Some mark it quietly as a national holiday, while others celebrate it with grandeur. Countries such as Sri Lanka, India, and Singapore have consistently chosen the latter path\u2014upholding unbroken traditions since gaining Independence from the British Empire.",
    "At the heart of these celebrations lies a shared purpose: affirming sovereignty, national pride, and Independence. Military parades, cultural displays, religious observances, and the participation of schoolchildren together reflect a nation\u2019s defence strength, cultural depth, and collective achievements. Central to these commemorations is the national address by the Head of State, which lends meaning, authority, and direction to the occasion.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s 78th Independence Day celebrations this year followed this long-standing tradition. The ceremony was dignified, simple, and well-attended by the diplomatic community. Notably, unnecessary extravagance was consciously avoided, creating an ambience that reflected restraint, respect, and national maturity. Overall, it was a pleasing and commendable expression of sovereignty.",
    "Before reflecting on President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s address, I am reminded of an experience from Singapore. In August 1990, I had the privilege of listening live to the National Day speech of Lee Kuan Yew. He spoke not in slogans, but in clear, practical terms\u2014explaining how Singapore had been built from near nothing into a debt-free, secure, and globally respected nation. He spoke of strong defence, disciplined governance, economic self-reliance, and even future challenges he anticipated decades ahead, along with solutions already in motion.",
    "That speech exemplified leadership rooted in vision, planning, and execution\u2014not rhetoric. India today, under dynamic leadership, offers another example of long-term economic direction, steadily progressing despite immense social challenges.",
    "It is therefore encouraging that Sri Lanka\u2019s newly elected President appears to be positioning himself along a similar trajectory.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s Independence Day address marked a clear departure from the confrontational tone often associated with political debate. Speaking as a Head of State rather than as an opposition figure, he delivered a message of unity, economic reconstruction, and national purpose\u2014without hostility or divisiveness.",
    "His emphasis on rebuilding Sri Lanka through unity, strengthening the economy, rejecting racism and extremism, restoring the rule of law, and undertaking transformative education reforms was both reassuring and confidence-building. Importantly, he framed economic development not as a break from our cultural and historical roots, but as a process firmly anchored in them.",
    "The President\u2019s call to prioritise human capital\u2014knowledge, education, discipline, compassion, and modern skills\u2014reflects a realistic understanding of today\u2019s global realities. His insistence that true freedom is incomplete without economic strength is a truth Sri Lanka must now confront honestly.",
    "Equally symbolic was the presence of the Leader of the Opposition at the ceremony, quietly reinforcing the very unity the President appealed for.",
    "This address helped dispel many apprehensions about the President\u2019s future direction. It outlined practicable goals grounded in national and global realities, rather than abstract promises.",
    "What is good, must be acknowledged as good.",
    "On this occasion, the President\u2019s speech deserves appreciation.",
    "We congratulate him\u2014and wish him the resolve to translate words into action.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s Independence Day address marked a clear departure from the confrontational tone often associated with political debate. Speaking as a Head of State rather than as an opposition figure, he delivered a message of unity, economic reconstruction, and national purpose\u2014without hostility or divisiveness"
