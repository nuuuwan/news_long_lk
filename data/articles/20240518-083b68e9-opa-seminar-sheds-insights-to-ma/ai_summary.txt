Sri Lanka has the largest ageing population in South Asia, prompting urgent actions to address the associated challenges. At a recent seminar by the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka, experts discussed the trends and challenges in managing this demographic. University of Colombo's Prof. Sudath Warnakulasuriya, University of Peradeniya's Dr. Sarath Rathnayake, and Consultant Dr. Sanath Hettige highlighted issues such as gerontophobia, ageism, elder abuse, healthcare costs, and caregiver strain. They pointed out that ageing also presents opportunities, citing the productivity of older age groups.

Key insights included the importance of addressing dementia, with Dr. Rathnayake noting that conditions like Alzheimerâ€™s are common, emphasizing early detection and lifestyle factors to delay progression. Dr. Hettige discussed the role of physical activity and proper diet in slowing ageing, recommending regular exercise and healthy food choices. He noted that while chronological ageing is inevitable, biological ageing can be managed through lifestyle modifications. The seminar underscored the need for a collective and proactive approach to the growing ageing population in Sri Lanka.
