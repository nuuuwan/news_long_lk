    "As soon as Google launched its latest video-generating AI model at the end of May, creatives rushed to put it through its paces. Released just months after its predecessor, Veo 3 allows users to generate sounds and dialogue for the first time, sparking a flurry of hyperrealistic eight-second clips stitched together into ads, ASMR videos, imagined film trailers, and humorous street interviews. Academy Award\u2013nominated director Darren Aronofsky used the tool to create a short film called Ancestra. During a press briefing, Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind\u2019s CEO, likened the leap forward to \u201cemerging from the silent era of video generation.\u201d\u00a0 But others quickly found that in some ways the tool wasn\u2019t behaving as expected. When it generates clips that include dialogue, Veo 3 often adds nonsensical, garbled subtitles, even when the prompts it\u2019s been given explicitly ask for no captions or subtitles to be added.\u00a0  Getting rid of them isn\u2019t straightforward\u2014or cheap. Users have been forced to resort to regenerating clips (which costs them more money), using external subtitle-removing tools, or cropping their videos to get rid of the subtitles altogether. Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, posted on X on June 9 that Google had developed fixes to reduce the gibberish text. But over a month later, users are still logging issues with it in Google Labs\u2019 Discord channel, demonstrating how difficult it can be to correct issues in major AI models.",
    "Like its predecessors, Veo 3 is available to paying members of Google\u2019s subscription tiers, which start at $249.99 a month. To generate an eight-second clip, users enter a text prompt describing the scene they\u2019d like to create into Google\u2019s AI filmmaking tool Flow, Gemini, or other Google platforms. Each Veo 3 generation costs a minimum of 20 AI credits, and the account can be topped up at a cost of $25 per 2,500 credits. Mona Weiss, an advertising creative director, says that regenerating her scenes in a bid to get rid of the random captions is becoming expensive. \u201cIf you\u2019re creating a scene with dialogue, up to 40% of its output has gibberish subtitles that make it unusable,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re burning through money trying to get a scene you like, but then you can\u2019t even use it.\u201d",
    "When Weiss reported the problem to Google Labs through its Discord channel in the hopes of getting a refund for her wasted credits, its team pointed her to the company\u2019s official support team. They offered her a refund for the cost of Veo 3, but not for the credits. Weiss declined, as accepting would have meant losing access to the model altogether. The Google Labs\u2019 Discord support team has been telling users that subtitles can be triggered by speech, saying that they\u2019re aware of the problem and are working to fix it.\u00a0 Related StoryI tested out a buzzy new text-to-video AI model from ChinaKuaishou\u2019s generative video model Kling, which could be poised to transform how short clips are created for platforms like TikTok.",
    "So why does Veo 3 insist on adding these subtitles, and why does it appear to be so difficult to solve the problem? It probably comes down to what the model has been trained on.\u00a0\u00a0 Although Google hasn\u2019t made this information public, that training data is likely to include YouTube videos, clips from vlogs and gaming channels, and TikTok edits, many of which come with subtitles. These embedded subtitles are part of the video frames rather than separate text tracks layered on top, meaning it\u2019s difficult to remove them before they\u2019re used for training, says Shuo Niu, an assistant professor at Clark University in Massachusetts who studies video sharing platforms and AI. \u201cThe text-to-video model is trained using reinforcement learning to produce content that mimics human-created videos, and if such videos include subtitles, the model may \u2018learn\u2019 that incorporating subtitles enhances similarity with human-generated content,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re continuously working to improve video creation, especially with text, speech that sounds natural, and audio that syncs perfectly,\u201d a Google spokesperson says. \u201cWe encourage users to try their prompt again if they notice an inconsistency and give us feedback using the thumbs up/down option.\u201d As for why the model ignores instructions such as \u201cNo subtitles,\u201d negative prompts (telling a generative AI model not to do something) are usually less effective than positive ones, says Tuhin Chakrabarty, an assistant professor at Stony Brook University who studies AI systems.\u00a0 To fix the problem, Google would have to check every frame of each video Veo 3 has been trained on, and either get rid of or relabel those with captions before retraining the model\u2014an endeavor that would take weeks, he says.\u00a0 Katerina Cizek, a documentary maker and artistic director at the MIT Open Documentary Lab, believes the problem exemplifies Google\u2019s willingness to launch products before they\u2019re fully ready.\u00a0 \u201cGoogle needed a win,\u201d she says. \u201cThey needed to be the first to pump out a tool that generates lip-synched audio. And so that was more important than fixing their subtitle issue.\u201d \u00a0 hide"
