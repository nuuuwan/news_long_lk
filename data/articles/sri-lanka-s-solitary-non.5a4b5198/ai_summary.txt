- In India, caste plays a very influential role in determining the outcome of elections in many electorates, regions, or states. 
- In Sri Lanka, caste also plays a part in politics.
- The Govigama and Vellala castes dominate the politics of Sinhalese and Tamil people, respectively.
- Since Independence from the British in 1948, all Prime Ministers and Presidents in Sri Lanka have been from the “majority” Sinhala race, “majority” Buddhist religion, and “majority” Govigama caste. The only exception was Ranasinghe Premadasa, a Sinhala Buddhist from a different caste.
- Premadasa served as Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister from 1978 to 1988 and as President from 1989 to 1993.

Opinions:
- Indian analysts and commentators are not “shy” about discussing caste openly when dissecting poll results.
- Talking about the caste issue should be met with more honesty and less hypocrisy in Sri Lanka.
- In the sub-continent, the traditional occupation of the Govigamas and the Vellalas has been agriculture.
- The ascendancy of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a person of subaltern status in class and caste terms, to the pinnacle of power in a party like the United National Party (UNP) amounts to a political fairy tale.
- Premadasa demonstrated remarkable administrative skills and a capacity for hard work, working up to fifteen hours a day at times.  
- Premadasa believed that the UNP needed to be revamped and restructured if it were to have a bright future.
