1. 🇱🇰💔 Rajavarothiyam Sampanthan, a prominent Sri Lankan Tamil political leader, passed away on June 30 at the age of 91.

2. 🏛️🗳️ His political career began in the 1960s, first being elected to Parliament in 1977 as a member of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).

3. 🐅🤝 In 2001, Sampanthan became the head of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which included parties involved in the campaign for an independent Tamil Eelam.

4. 👥👑 The TNA declared the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) as the sole representatives of the Tamil community, a move that drew criticism both domestically and internationally.

5. 📉🔥 The TNA, under Sampanthan's leadership, lost respect among the Tamil people and globally, being viewed as an extension of the LTTE.

6. 🔇👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 While the TNA voiced opposition to military excesses in the war, they remained silent on the LTTE's abuses, including refusing to allow civilians to leave LTTE-controlled areas.

7. 📢💥 After the war, Sampanthan played a major role in highlighting the devastation the war had wrought on the Tamil civilians.

8. 🇱🇰🔒 Though he faced criticism for his connections to the LTTE, Sampanthan emphasized his commitment to Sri Lanka and his desire to be a part of the nation.

9. 🧩🙇‍♂️ Sampanthan was known for his contradictions: maintaining ties with LTTE while denouncing their actions; wanting to be part of Sri Lanka but not denouncing the separatist campaign.

10. 🗳️❓ Before his death, Sampanthan was reportedly in favor of endorsing the incumbent president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the upcoming elections.
