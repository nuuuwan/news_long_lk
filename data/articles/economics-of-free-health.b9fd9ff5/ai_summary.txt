1. 🏋️‍♀️ Self-responsibility and preventive healthcare can considerably reduce demand on both public and private health sectors in Sri Lanka.
2. 🌱 Despite hard physical labor, many Sri Lankans remain unconcerned about health and environmental prevention, such as the dangers of burning plastic or not wearing masks.
3. 🏥 Sri Lanka's universal free healthcare system, launched in the 1960s and 70s, has led to massive public debt due to constant budget deficits from 1956.
4. 💸 Recent studies focus on understanding influences on public health expenditure (PHE) to ensure financial sustainability.
5. 👩‍⚕️ In free healthcare systems like Sri Lanka's, 'demand induced supply' is common, meaning the government must adapt to meet increasing demand and cost conditions. 
6. 👴 Elderly population shares do not have a stable relationship with per capita PHE after accounting for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are a strong predictor of PHE.
7. 💰 If current trends persist, PHE is projected to grow by 13% p.a. until 2040, potentially increasing the PHE share of GDP to over 2.8% by then.
8. 📉 Preventive healthcare, which goes beyond direct medical services like vaccination, is key to reducing demand for healthcare.
9. 🚭 A study of health-related risk behaviors in four countries, including Australia and Singapore, showed declining smoking rates across generations.
10. 🍏 Sri Lanka could learn from Singapore's preventive healthcare landscape, particularly in educating the public on self-responsibility in healthcare and diversion of funds from the private to public sector.
