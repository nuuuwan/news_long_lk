    "This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. Green-steel startup Boston Metal just showed that it has all the ingredients needed to make steel without emitting gobs of greenhouse gases. The company successfully ran its largest reactor yet to make steel, producing over a ton of metal, MIT Technology Review can exclusively report. Related StoryThe world\u2019s first industrial-scale plant for green steel promises a cleaner futureThe Swedish startup Stegra has raised close to $7 billion to produce zero-emissions steel using green hydrogen starting in 2026.",
    "The latest milestone means that Boston Metal just got one step closer to commercializing its technology. The company\u2019s process uses electricity to make steel, and depending on the source of that electricity, it could mean cleaning up production of one of the most polluting materials on the planet. The world produces about 2 billion metric tons of steel each year, emitting over 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in the process. While there are still a lot of milestones left before reaching the scale needed to make a dent in the steel industry, the latest run shows that the company can scale up its process.",
    "Boston Metal started up its industrial reactor for steelmaking in January, and after it had run for several weeks, the company siphoned out roughly a ton of material on February 17. (You can see a video of the molten metal here. It\u2019s really cool.) Work on this reactor has been underway for a while. I got to visit the facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, in 2022, when construction was nearly done. In the years since, the company has been working on testing it out to make other metals before retrofitting it for steel production.",
    "Boston Metal\u2019s approach is very different from that of a conventional steel plant. Steelmaking typically involves a blast furnace, which uses a coal-based fuel called coke to drive the reactions needed to turn iron ore into iron (the key ingredient in steel). The carbon in coke combines with oxygen pulled out of the iron ore, which gets released as carbon dioxide. Instead, Boston Metal uses electricity in a process called molten oxide electrolysis (MOE). Iron ore gets loaded into a reactor, mixed with other ingredients, and then electricity is run through it, heating the mixture to around 1,600 \u00b0C (2,900 \u00b0F) and driving the reactions needed to make iron. That iron can then be turned into steel.\u00a0 Crucially for the climate, this process emits oxygen rather than carbon dioxide (that infamous greenhouse gas). If renewables like wind and solar or nuclear power are used as the source of electricity, then this approach can virtually cut out the climate impact from steel production.\u00a0 MOE was developed at MIT, and Boston Metal was founded in 2013 to commercialize the technology. Since then, the company has worked to take it from lab scale, with reactors roughly the size of a coffee cup, to much larger ones that can produce tons of metal at a time. That\u2019s crucial for an industry that operates on the scale of billions of tons per year.  \u201cThe volumes of steel everywhere around us\u2014it\u2019s immense,\u201d says Adam Rauwerdink, senior vice president of business development at Boston Metal. \u201cThe scale is massive.\u201d  BOSTON METAL   Making the huge amounts of steel required to be commercially relevant has been quite the technical challenge.\u00a0 One key component of Boston Metal\u2019s design is the anode. It\u2019s basically a rounded metallic bit that sticks into the reactor, providing a way for electricity to get in and drive the reactions required. In theory, this anode doesn\u2019t get used up, but if the conditions aren\u2019t quite right, it can degrade over time. Over the past few years, the company has made a lot of progress in preventing inert anode degradation, Rauwerdink says. The latest phase of work is more complicated, because now the company is adding multiple anodes in the same reactor.",
    "In lab-scale reactors, there\u2019s one anode, and it\u2019s quite small. Larger reactors require bigger anodes, and at a certain point it\u2019s necessary to add more of them. The latest run continues to prove how Boston Metal\u2019s approach can scale, Rauwerdink says: making reactors larger, adding more anodes, and then adding multiple reactors together in a single plant to make the volumes of material needed.

Now, construction is underway in Sweden on an industrial-scale plant that will emit almost zero carbon dioxide.",
    "Now that the company has completed its first run of the multi-anode reactor for steelmaking, the plan is to keep exploring how the reactions happen at this larger scale. These runs will also help the company better understand what it will cost to make its products. The next step is to build an even bigger system, Rauwerdink says\u2014something that won\u2019t fit in the Boston facility. While a reactor of the current size can make a ton or two of material in about a month, the truly industrial-scale equipment will make that amount of metal in about a day. That demonstration plant should come online in late 2026 and begin operation in 2027, he says. Ultimately, the company hopes to license its technology to steelmakers.\u00a0 In steel and other heavy industries, the scale can be mind-boggling. Boston Metal has been at this for over a decade, and it\u2019s fascinating to see the company make progress toward becoming a player in this massive industry.\u00a0   Now read the rest of The Spark Related reading We named green steel one of our 2025 Breakthrough Technologies.
