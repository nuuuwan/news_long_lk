Facts presented:
- Argentina experienced considerable economic success in the early 1900s, being the fifth largest economy in the world.
- Argentine President Juan Peron implemented policies that aimed to make the country self-sufficient from 1946, this included high import tariffs and exports taxes. 
- Peron's policies led to unsustainable welfare schemes and disinvestment in Argentina's resources. 
- This policy trajectory has resulted in Argentina defaulting a total of 9 times, 3 times within the 21st century alone. 
- Argentina's most famous economist, Raul Prebisch, influenced this paradigm shift towards import substitution and self-sufficiency with the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis. 
- This import substitution approach influenced other countries like India up until the early 1990s. 
- Similar economic patterns are observed in Sri Lanka, where from the mid 1950s the nation followed a trajectory of import substitution resulting in economic crisis, goods shortages, and high prices. 

Opinions expressed:
- Import substitution has been a detrimental economic policy for countries such as Argentina and Sri Lanka, causing a series of recessions, currency devaluation, and debt accumulation.
- Argentina's unwelcoming attitude towards foreign direct investment led to the underuse and underinvestment in its resources.
- The focus on self-sufficiency has resulted in lower quality products, less innovation, and makes Argentinian products uncompetitive internationally.
- The shunning of areas where Argentina had a comparative advantage, like agriculture, in favour of unproductive and uncompetitive sectors has been negative for the economy. 
- Trade protectionism alongside import substitution laid the foundation for Argentina's economic crisis from which it is yet to recover.
- Import substitution does not work as it diverts resources from potentially successful sectors, leading to debt replacing exports to balance the current account.
