    "The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), a prominent political party representing Tamils of Sri Lanka\u2019s north and east, on Sunday (September 1) pledged support for presidential aspirant Sajith Premadasa in the September 21 election.",
    "The move, which reflects one significant position within the island nation\u2019s fragmented Tamil polity, comes even as the ITAK\u2019s former coalition partners \u2014 along with other political groups \u2014 back former parliamentarian and ITAK member P. Ariyanethiran as a \u201ccommon Tamil candidate\u201d in the presidential race, in which incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr. Premadasa, and opposition politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake have emerged as key contenders.",
    "The central committee of ITAK met on Sunday and decided the party will not back Mr. Ariyanethiran, instead announcing its support for Mr. Premadasa, who Tamils voted for in large numbers in the 2019 presidential election, principally to reject Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Further, ITAK sources said the party would request Mr. Ariyanethiran to withdraw from the race, to arrest the apparent divisions within the Tamil electorate.",
    "The ITAK was the chief constituent of the former Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a formidable grouping representing Tamils of the north and east in parliament. The TNA collapsed in recent years amid differences among members. The ITAK, too, is grappling with internal differences that have only aggravated after senior party member and noted Tamil leader R. Sampanthan passed away in July.",
    "The ITAK\u2019s position on the presidential polls was awaited by many, especially in the wake of party member and legislator S. Shritharan recently endorsing the \u201ccommon candidate\u201d.",
    "His party and parliamentary colleague M.A. Sumanthiran, meanwhile, has termed the idea of fielding a Tamil candidate a \u201cnonsensical one\u201d, arguing that the move would weaken Tamils\u2019 bargaining power with the winning candidate, who will invariably be a contestant from the island\u2019s southern, Sinhala-Buddhist majority.",
    "Tamil voters are faced with different positions of their political leadership, ranging from backing a Tamil candidate, or a preferred Sinhalese leader, or boycotting the elections, as the All Ceylon Tamil Congress has decided to, protesting the many failed promises of past leaders.",
    "Following the ITAK\u2019s announcement, Mr. Premadasa said on social media platform X: \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll create a future where everyone wins \u2014 a future with no racism, no discrimination and a future built on unity, strength, and shared purpose.\u201d",
    "Mr. Premadasa, who released his manifesto last week, has pledged a new constitution where Sri Lanka\u2019s current political system would be converted to a parliamentary system \u201cwith maximum devolution based on the 13th Amendment under one country\u201d. The contentious 13th Amendment, which assures a measure of power devolution to Sri Lanka\u2019s nine provinces, was passed in 1987 following the Indo-Lanka Accord.",
    "It is yet to see full implementation in nearly four decades. Successive Sri Lankan leaders have refused to part especially with land and police powers although many Tamil leaders see the legislation as inadequate for meaningful power-sharing."
