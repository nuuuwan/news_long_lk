1️⃣ Government is considering amending the Constitution to change President's term from "six years" to "five years". 🏛️
2️⃣ This move is being scrutinized in relation to Machiavellian politics, suggesting manipulation to retain power. 🧐
3️⃣ Last week, Supreme Court confirmed President's term is five years according to the Constitution's 19th Amendment. 📜
4️⃣ Businessman who challenged the validity of the 19th Amendment was ordered to pay Rs. 100,000. 💸
5️⃣ Another attempt to delay Presidential election was rejected by Supreme Court; lawyer ordered to pay Rs. 500,000 for frivolous application. ⚖️
6️⃣ Cabinet of Ministers has approved a Bill to amend the Constitution, aiming to align Article 83 with amendments made by the 19th Amendment. 📝
7️⃣ 1978 Constitution stated President and Parliament shall hold office for six years; Article 83 dictates changes to this can only take place with majority Parliament vote and public referendum. 🗳️
8️⃣ 19th Amendment, enacted after 2015 election, reduced term of office of the President and duration of Parliament to five years. ⏳
9️⃣ Changes to Constitution now proposed could lead to costly national referendum just before upcoming Presidential election. 💰
🔟 Speculation exists over possible hidden agenda, such as an amendment seeking to restore original six-year term from 1978 Constitution, bypassing the need for a referendum. 👀
