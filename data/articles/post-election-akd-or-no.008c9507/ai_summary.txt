The incumbent president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is expected to run for re-election in the upcoming Sri Lanka Presidential Election slated to be held between 17 September and 16 October 2024. The popularity of the challenger, the National People's Power (NPP) party, is reported to be increasing with strong showings in May Day rallies. This is causing concern among the established political groups which are working towards creating sustainable coalitions to prevent the NPP from capturing power. The subject on whether the presidential or general election should be held first is still in contention. The incumbent president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is praised for recovering the economy that was in dire straits. However, there's a criticism on him for not considering economic hardship of those who contributed to that recovery.
