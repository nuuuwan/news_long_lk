When people believe their government is competent and honest, they are more likely to comply with tax obligations

“Taxation is the price we pay for civilisation.”

– Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

This timeless quote encapsulates the essence of tax morale—the belief that paying taxes is not merely a legal obligation, but a civic duty that upholds the social contract between citizens and the state. In Sri Lanka, where economic recovery and institutional trust are at a critical juncture, enhancing tax morale is not just desirable—it is imperative.

Understanding tax morale

Tax morale refers to the intrinsic motivation of individuals and businesses to comply with tax laws, beyond the deterrent effect of audits or penalties. Tax morale is fundamentally rooted in trust in the Government. While it is also shaped by perceived fairness, transparency, and civic responsibility, it is the confidence that citizens place in the Government that most strongly influences their willingness to comply with tax laws voluntarily.

When tax morale is high, it leads to an increase in voluntary compliance. When it is low, evasion and resistance become more prevalent, weakening the fiscal foundation of the state. Tax morale reflects how citizens perceive the legitimacy of the tax system and their role within it—it is a mirror of the broader relationship between the State and the public.

Why tax morale matters

Tax morale is a cornerstone of a resilient and equitable tax system and revolves around the willingness of citizens to pay taxes. It reflects public trust in the Government, perceptions of fairness, and the belief that tax revenues are used responsibly. In Sri Lanka’s current context, where economic recovery hinges on both revenue generation and social equity, strengthening tax morale is essential. When people feel the system is just and transparent, compliance improves, tax revenues rise, and the tax burden can be shared more fairly.

Its significance lies in several key areas:

Boosts voluntary compliance: When citizens believe the tax system is fair and transparent, they are more likely to comply willingly. This reduces the need for costly enforcement measures such as audits, penalties, and legal proceedings. A high level of voluntary compliance also improves efficiency within tax administration and fosters a culture of civic responsibility.

Strengthens public trust: Tax morale is closely tied to how people perceive government accountability. When taxpayers see visible improvements in public services — such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure — they are more inclined to trust that their contributions are making a difference. This trust is vital for long-term fiscal cooperation between citizens and the state.

Supports fiscal sustainability: A broad and compliant taxpayer base ensures a steady stream of revenue, which is crucial for funding essential services and development projects. High tax morale helps governments avoid over-reliance on debt or inflationary financing, contributing to macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth.

Reduces inequality: When tax morale is low, evasion and avoidance tend to rise — often among those with greater means. This shifts the burden unfairly onto honest taxpayers. A strong culture of compliance ensures that everyone pays their fair share, helping to reduce income disparities and promote social justice.

Ultimately, tax morale isn’t just about paying dues, but it’s about building a social contract rooted in accountability and shared progress. In Sri Lanka, where tax compliance remains a persistent challenge, improving tax morale could substantially enhance tax revenue collection.

OECD insights: Strengthening tax morale

The OECD’s 2019 report on Tax Morale offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and improving this vital concept. It emphasises that tax morale should complement, not replace, traditional compliance strategies such as audits and penalties. Key highlights extracted from the report are as follows.

1. Tax morale is multi-dimensional

Encompasses trust, fairness, transparency, and citizen engagement:

Tax morale isn’t driven by a single factor. It reflects how citizens perceive the fairness of the tax system, the transparency of government spending, and their own role in civic life. A system that is perceived as equitable and inclusive fosters stronger voluntary compliance.

Requires addressing both institutional integrity and individual perceptions:

Improving tax morale means tackling both systemic issues — such as corruption or inefficiency — and personal beliefs. Citizens must see institutions as trustworthy and feel that their contributions are meaningful and respected.

2. Institutional factors matter

Trust in the Government is a strong predictor of tax morale:

When people believe their government is competent and honest, they are more likely to comply with tax obligations. Transparency in budgeting and spending builds this trust.

Citizens who believe in meritocracy or support fiscal redistribution are more likely to comply:

If taxpayers experience that the system rewards effort and redistributes wealth fairly — for example, taxing the rich to support the poor — they are more inclined to view taxes as a tool for social justice rather than a burden.

Support for democracy correlates with the belief that tax evasion is unjustifiable:

In democratic societies, where citizens have a voice in Governance, tax evasion is more likely to be seen as undermining collective progress. This moral stance reinforces compliance

3. Simplicity and accessibility

Complex tax systems discourage compliance:

When tax rules are overly complicated or unclear, even well-intentioned taxpayers may struggle to comply. Complexity breeds confusion, frustration, and avoidance.

Taxpayer education and digital tools can simplify processes and reduce corruption:

Clear guidance, user-friendly platforms, and digital filing systems empower citizens to meet their obligations easily. These tools also reduce opportunities for discretionary decision-making and corruption within tax administration.

4.Public services as a trust builder

Effective public services demonstrate how tax revenues are used, creating a “double dividend”:

Citizens benefit directly from services:

When taxpayers see tangible improvements — better roads, schools, hospitals — they recognise the value of their contributions.

Satisfaction with service delivery increases willingness to pay taxes:

Positive experiences with public services reinforce the belief that taxes are a worthwhile investment, not just a legal obligation.

5. Hypothecated taxes: A mixed tool

Linking specific taxes to specific services can build trust and support reform:

For example, earmarking fuel taxes for road maintenance helps citizens see a direct connection between what they pay and what they receive, enhancing transparency and accountability. While this is popular, hypothecation can constrain fiscal policy and lead to inefficiencies if funds are not allocated or monitored properly. It requires strong governance and clear communication.

While the OECD provides a global framework, the local context is crucial.

Tax morale is shaped by cultural, economic, and political factors unique to each country. Sri Lanka needs tailored studies to understand what drives tax morale across different population segments. Understanding regional disparities, income-level perceptions, and sector-specific challenges can help design more effective, targeted interventions to boost compliance and trust.

Sri Lanka’s path forward: Policy recommendations

Sri Lanka can draw from OECD recommendations and global best practices to foster a more ethical, transparent, and inclusive tax system.

1. Enhance public financial transparency

Publish detailed reports on tax revenue allocation.

Regularly releasing comprehensive breakdowns of how tax revenues are spent — across sectors like health, education, infrastructure, and social welfare — helps build public confidence. Transparency in allocation allows citizens to see the tangible impact of their contributions.

Use digital platforms to show real-time spending on health, education, and infrastructure.

Interactive dashboards can provide real-time updates on government spending. This not only improves accountability but also empowers civil society and media to monitor and evaluate fiscal performance.

2. Strengthen ethical governance

Enforce anti-corruption laws rigorously.

A zero-tolerance approach to corruption within tax administration and public finance management is essential. Strong enforcement mechanisms, independent oversight bodies, and whistleblower protections can deter misuse and restore trust.

Train tax officials in ethical conduct and taxpayer service.

Capacity-building programs should focus on integrity, professionalism, and service orientation. When tax officials treat citizens respectfully and fairly, it enhances the legitimacy of the system and encourages voluntary compliance.

3. Simplify tax filing and payment systems

Expand e-filing and mobile payment options.

Making tax filing more accessible through digital platforms and mobile apps reduces administrative burdens and encourages participation, especially among small businesses and informal sector workers.

Offer multilingual support and continue taxpayer education initiatives.

Providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English ensures inclusivity. Ongoing education campaigns through schools, media, and community outreach can demystify tax obligations and promote a culture of compliance.

4. Promote fairness and equity

Review tax exemptions and incentives to ensure they are equitably distributed.

Periodic audits of tax incentives and exemptions can help identify distortions or favouritism. Rationalising these benefits ensures that they serve public interest and do not disproportionately benefit a privileged few.

Introduce progressive reforms aligned with the ability to pay.

Policymakers should consider widening progressive personal income tax slabs, allowing lower-income earners to retain more disposable income. This approach ensures that taxation reflects economic capacity and supports social equity.

5. Engage citizens and businesses in tax reform discussions

Conduct public consultations on tax reforms.

Inclusive dialogue with stakeholders — including civil society, SMEs, and professional bodies — ensures that reforms are grounded. It also fosters ownership and reduces resistance to change.

Recognise compliant taxpayers through awards.

Publicly acknowledging individuals and businesses that demonstrate consistent compliance can incentivise good behaviour. Recognition programs also help shift the narrative around taxation from obligation to civic pride.

6. Strategic use of hypothecated taxes

Sri Lankan policymakers should consider the strategic introduction and expansion of hypothecated taxes—tax instruments where revenue is earmarked for specific public programs or funds. An existing example is the Crop Insurance Levy, which is directly allocated to the National Insurance Trust Fund to compensate farmers affected by natural disasters. Targeted taxes/levies can build public trust and ensure that tax revenue visibly supports essential services.

To enhance transparency and accountability, any hypothecated tax must be accompanied by:

A clearly defined purpose,

A dedicated fund or account, and

A publicly accessible audit trail showing how the revenue is utilised.

Rather than introducing a new tax, the author proposes that a small portion of existing VAT revenue—such as 1%—be earmarked for a dedicated social welfare fund. This fund could be used to finance essential goods and services for underprivileged and marginalised communities, thereby aligning fiscal policy with social equity goals. Such an approach would not only improve tax morale but also demonstrate the Government’s commitment to inclusive development

Conclusion: A call to action

Sri Lanka stands at a pivotal moment in its fiscal journey. Enhancing tax morale is not merely a technical reform—it is a societal transformation rooted in trust, fairness, and civic responsibility.

With Budget 2026 on the horizon, policymakers must prioritise:

Transparency and accountability in public spending.

Investment in taxpayer education and digital infrastructure.

Fairness and equity in tax policy.

Exploring hypothecated taxes for sectors like health and education to build trust.

Importantly, building a tax-conscious society must start early. Incorporating basic tax education into the school curriculum can help develop a generation that understands the role of taxes in nation-building. This should go beyond exam-focused learning — emphasising civic awareness, ethical responsibility, and the importance of contributing to public goods. When children grow up understanding why taxes matter, they are more likely to become responsible and engaged citizens.

As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (a former US Supreme Court Justice) reminds us, “Taxation is the price we pay for civilisation”. In Sri Lanka, that price must be matched by a renewed commitment to ethical governance, inclusive policymaking, and a stronger fiscal contract between the state and its citizens.
