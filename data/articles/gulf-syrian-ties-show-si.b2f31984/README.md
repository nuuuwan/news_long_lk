# Gulf-Syrian ties show signs of gradually warming

## Summary ðŸ¤–

Facts:
- Diplomatic exchanges and initiatives between Syria and its emerging Gulf partners have increased, with Saudi Arabia appointing an ambassador in Damascus for the first time since 2012.
- Relations between Syria and Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries are expected to strengthen during the period of 2024-28.
- Syria was reinstated into the Arab League in May 2023 after its suspension in 2012 following violent government repression of demonstrators during the Arab Spring uprisings.
- Saudi Arabia and the UAE have made concessions to the Syrian regime including the restoration of flights from Syria to Jeddah and have sought to diminish Iranian influence in Syria.
- Syria vouched in favor of the UAEâ€™s claims to disputed territories during an Arab League Summit in May, which is seen as a symbolic concession to the Gulf States.
- Normalization efforts with Syria are expected to advance from 2024 to 2028 with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and smaller Gulf states seeking to increase their political leverage over Syria, contributing to Syria's investment, trade, and aid inflows.

Opinions:
- Despite improving relations, political and logistical hurdles will constrain the acceleration of diplomatic normalization between Syria and GCC countries, limiting its economic potential.
- The acceptance of President Bashar al-Assad by Middle Eastern regimes reflects a recognition that efforts to displace him have been unsuccessful.
- Syrian adherence to Iran will not change despite the recent improvement in relations with GCC countries.
- The Syrian regime's role in drug-smuggling networks, especially involving the synthetic stimulant drug Captagon, is considered a major concern.
- Syrian reluctance to comply with demands to curtail its role in Captagon-smuggling and the existence of logistical obstacles such as US-led sanctions will hinder the progress of diplomatic ties.

Gulf-Syrian ties show signs of gradually warming

A flurry of diplomatic exchanges and initiatives has taken place between Syria and its nascent Gulf partners in May, culminating in Saudi Arabiaâ€™s appointment of an ambassador in Damascus, the Syrian capital, for the first time since 2012.Â We expect that relations between Syria and Gulf Coâ€‘operation CouncilÂ (GCC) countries will strengthen in 2024â€‘28,Â although perennial political and logistical hurdles will constrain the scope ofÂ diplomatic normalisation, limiting its economic potential.

Syria made a symbolic return to the Arab political fold in May 2023Â following the lifting of its suspension from the Arab League, which had been imposed in 2012 in opposition to the governmentâ€™s violent repression of demonstrators during the Arab Spring uprisings.Â The move reflected a broad acceptance among the regimeâ€™s former opponents in the Middle East that efforts to oust the president, Bashar al-Assad, had failed, and that he, his Baath Party and its political allies are highly likely to remain in power in Syria in the longÂ term.

Saudi ArabiaÂ andÂ the UAEÂ in particular have sought to adapt to this reality by offering concessions to the Syrian regime in an attempt to temper Syriaâ€™s behaviour regionally.Â In May Saudi Arabia restored flights from Syria to Jeddah (a Saudi port city) that will facilitate the direct flow of hajj pilgrims for the first time in more than a decade. Both parties are seeking to erode Iranian influence in Syria, which has become deeply entrenched during the course of Syriaâ€™s 13â€‘year civil war, although this is becoming less pertinent, given the recent improvement in ties between Iran and the GCC. More pressing are efforts to curtailÂ the regimeâ€™s role as a major player in regional drug-smuggling networks, especially of Captagon (a synthetic stimulant drug), the usage of which is rising rapidly in theÂ Gulf.

Syria, in turn, has made symbolic concessions to the Gulf states in order to cement recently mended ties. This includes voting at the Arab League summit in late May in favour of supportingÂ the UAEâ€™s claims to the islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and Greater Tunbâ€”territory that is historically disputed by Iran. Despite this minor re-calibration of its foreign policy,Â we do not expect the regime to pivot away from ties with its closest external ally, Iran, in 2024-28.

Normalisation efforts will advance in 2024â€‘28 as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and smaller Gulf states seek to increase their political leverage over Syria.Â This will provide a modest boost to Syriaâ€™s investment, trade and aid inflows, catalysing reconstruction efforts and helping to curb exchange-rate volatility by providing muchâ€‘needed hard currency. However, Syrian reticence to comply with demands to curtail its role in Captagonâ€‘smuggling, alongside logistical obstacles, particularly USâ€‘led sanctions, will continue to constrain the scope of progress with building diplomatic ties throughout the forecast period.
