    "A flurry of diplomatic exchanges and initiatives has taken place between Syria and its nascent Gulf partners in May, culminating in Saudi Arabia\u2019s appointment of an ambassador in Damascus, the Syrian capital, for the first time since 2012.\u00a0We expect that relations between Syria and Gulf Co\u2011operation Council\u00a0(GCC) countries will strengthen in 2024\u201128,\u00a0although perennial political and logistical hurdles will constrain the scope of\u00a0diplomatic normalisation, limiting its economic potential.",
    "Syria made a symbolic return to the Arab political fold in May 2023\u00a0following the lifting of its suspension from the Arab League, which had been imposed in 2012 in opposition to the government\u2019s violent repression of demonstrators during the Arab Spring uprisings.\u00a0The move reflected a broad acceptance among the regime\u2019s former opponents in the Middle East that efforts to oust the president, Bashar al-Assad, had failed, and that he, his Baath Party and its political allies are highly likely to remain in power in Syria in the long\u00a0term.",
    "Saudi Arabia\u00a0and\u00a0the UAE\u00a0in particular have sought to adapt to this reality by offering concessions to the Syrian regime in an attempt to temper Syria\u2019s behaviour regionally.\u00a0In May Saudi Arabia restored flights from Syria to Jeddah (a Saudi port city) that will facilitate the direct flow of hajj pilgrims for the first time in more than a decade. Both parties are seeking to erode Iranian influence in Syria, which has become deeply entrenched during the course of Syria\u2019s 13\u2011year civil war, although this is becoming less pertinent, given the recent improvement in ties between Iran and the GCC. More pressing are efforts to curtail\u00a0the regime\u2019s role as a major player in regional drug-smuggling networks, especially of Captagon (a synthetic stimulant drug), the usage of which is rising rapidly in the\u00a0Gulf.",
    "Syria, in turn, has made symbolic concessions to the Gulf states in order to cement recently mended ties. This includes voting at the Arab League summit in late May in favour of supporting\u00a0the UAE\u2019s claims to the islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and Greater Tunb\u2014territory that is historically disputed by Iran. Despite this minor re-calibration of its foreign policy,\u00a0we do not expect the regime to pivot away from ties with its closest external ally, Iran, in 2024-28.",
    "Normalisation efforts will advance in 2024\u201128 as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and smaller Gulf states seek to increase their political leverage over Syria.\u00a0This will provide a modest boost to Syria\u2019s investment, trade and aid inflows, catalysing reconstruction efforts and helping to curb exchange-rate volatility by providing much\u2011needed hard currency. However, Syrian reticence to comply with demands to curtail its role in Captagon\u2011smuggling, alongside logistical obstacles, particularly US\u2011led sanctions, will continue to constrain the scope of progress with building diplomatic ties throughout the forecast period.",
