- 🎥 The Tamil film "Captain Miller" released on January 12, 2024, features the story of a heroic rebel fighting against British colonial rule, starring popular actor Dhanush.
- 📈 The film became the highest-grossing movie featuring Dhanush.
- 🎬 The title "Captain Miller" was the pseudonym of a suicide bomber from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) group, who conducted a suicidal operation on July 5, 1987.
- 💥 The actual Captain Miller drove a truck loaded with explosives into an army camp, marking the first instance of LTTE using a "Black Tiger" for such an attack.
- 😢 Following the fall of the Vadamaratchy division to Sri Lankan army control, the LTTE decided to stage a suicidal attack to reclaim the people's confidence.
- 🙋‍♂️ Vasanthan alias Captain Miller volunteered for the attack, given his school geography knowledge of the army camp's area. His was the first suicide mission, later known as a Black Tiger operation.
- 🎗️ LTTE leader Prabhakaran himself coined the term "Black Tiger", and described these individuals as having unwavering purpose and strength of will, striking in the night and with an emphasis on secrecy.
- 🙌 Before the attack, Vasanthan asked for a large amount of money which he divided equally among his comrades as his farewell gift. The money returned to the LTTE after his death was refused by Miller's family and was taken as a donation.
- ❌ In 1986, the LTTE had banned private sale of toddy and arrack, causing many to continue drinking in unlicensed areas. When Miller's father was caught defying this rule, he refused preferential treatment from the LTTE resulting in everyone in his group being released.
- 🰾 The impact of these tent-pole historical moments is visible even years later, as demonstrated by the Tamil film referencing the first Black Tiger suicide attack.
