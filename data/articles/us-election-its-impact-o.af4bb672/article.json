    "US election: its impact on Latin America",
    "ElectionsForecastingPoliticsUS electionAmericasUnited StatesCountry Analysis",
    "Many Latin American and Caribbean economies are disproportionately exposed to developments in the US owing to geographical proximity, a high level of economic integration and widespread migration to the US. The outcome of the US presidential election in November 2024 will be no exception.",
    "If the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, wins the election, the region will face slower economic growth, higher inflation, steeper borrowing costs and more complicated foreign relations, especially regarding China.",
    "If the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, wins instead, the regional outlook would be far more benign, although we would still expect some tightening of US policies on immigration and China.",
    "Mexico and Central America would be the most vulnerable to dramatic shifts in US policy following the election, whereas South American economies would be more insulated.",
    "Our baseline forecast is that\u00a0Mr Trump will win\u00a0a second (non-consecutive) term as US president. However, risks to this call remain high, given\u00a0Ms Harris\u2019s increasing momentum\u00a0since entering the race in late July. The candidates have dramatically different policy positions, which creates distinct scenarios for the Latin America and Caribbean region depending on the election result.\u00a0We believe that sharp US policy shifts under a Trump administration would shave 0.2 percentage points off the region\u2019s economic growth outlook in 2025-28, compared with the alternative scenario of a Harris administration.",
    "The primary channels for these Trump effects would be trade policy, immigration policy, monetary policy and foreign policy, including Mr Trump\u2019s more hawkish approach towards China. Not all Latin American and Caribbean economies would be equally exposed; we believe that Mexico and Central America would be the most affected, whereas South American economies would be more insulated.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s trade policies pose significant downside risks for the region",
    "If elected, we would expect Ms Harris to maintain broad policy continuity with the current Democratic president, Joe Biden, for whom she now serves as vice-president. This would apply to US trade relations, including with Latin American and Caribbean economies, and we would expect her to share Mr Biden\u2019s focus on keeping these relationships smooth. Partner countries would benefit from the predictability and transparency that such a stable approach would allow. For example, we would expect the renewal of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is scheduled for 2026, to proceed without difficulty and in good faith. Any areas of disagreement, including over Mexico\u2019s protectionist energy policies, would be addressed without compromising the agreement\u2019s integrity or damaging the business climates of the member countries.",
    "A Trump administration, in contrast, would pursue a complete overhaul of US trade policy, generating substantial uncertainty for the region\u2019s export-oriented economies.\u00a0Mr Trump\u2019s plans for a flat import tariff, which we would expect to be implemented at a rate of\u00a05-10% and by end-2025, would weigh heavily on countries that rely on the US as an export market but that lack a free-trade agreement (FTA); Ecuador is one example. Countries that have an FTA with the US would probably be shielded from the tariff and could benefit from some trade diversion. However, Mr Trump\u2019s fixation on US trade deficits (Mexico is a stand-out case) and his broadly transactional approach would put these FTAs at risk of disruption. As regards the USMCA, we would expect Mr Trump to treat the upcoming renewal as a full renegotiation, with the aim of extracting concessions, including more migration management from Mexico. Any overreach by Mr Trump would risk a full breakdown of negotiations, potentially culminating in the US exiting the agreement, although this is not part of\u00a0our baseline forecast. The Dominican Republic-Central America Free-Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) would face less serious risks, given the US\u2019s traditional trade surplus with the bloc, but Mr Trump could still use it as leverage to suppress irregular migration from member countries.",
    "Even if these FTAs survive, as we expect, Mr Trump\u2019s hostile rhetoric would weigh on the region\u2019s external sector in other ways. His narrow focus on bringing industrial jobs back to the US, including in the auto sector, would discourage the nearshoring-related private and foreign direct investment that we would expect to proliferate during a Harris presidency (although her administration would remain wary of increasing Chinese investment in the region). Mr Trump\u2019s efforts to erode the Biden administration\u2019s green subsidies and related incentives would have similar effects, particularly on Mexico\u2019s burgeoning electric vehicle manufacturing sector. Shifting US priorities on the green transition would also affect the region\u2019s commodities trade. Exporters of critical minerals, such as Chile, would have to contend with slower global price growth as US demand for green technologies softens. Meanwhile, Mr Trump\u2019s loosening of regulations on products that depend on fossil fuels, such as combustion vehicles, would keep oil prices elevated for longer; this would benefit oil-exporting economies (such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana and Mexico) but would act as a drag on the current accounts of net importers (including Chile and most Central American and Caribbean countries).",
    "Tighter US immigration policies would weigh on remittances, growth and security",
    "Latin American and Caribbean economies have the most to lose from an aggressive tightening of US immigration policies under Mr Trump. Ms Harris would probably continue the Biden administration\u2019s broadly accommodative stance on immigration while tightening controls to discourage illegal entries. Mr Trump, in contrast, would take a fully restrictive approach. He has already threatened to deport the estimated 11m undocumented migrants living in the US (some for more than a decade); Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans make up some of the largest shares of this group. He would also look to dismantle humanitarian parole programmes, which expanded under Mr Biden and have benefited Cubans, Haitians and Venezuelans, as well as migrants from elsewhere in the region. Attempts to close off legal channels for skilled labour migration, such as the H\u20111B visa programme, would be likely as well.",
    "Although attempts to introduce much more aggressive immigration policies would face logistical hurdles and court challenges, as was the case during Mr Trump\u2019s first term, we would still expect them to reduce the total population of migrants in the US during his presidency. This would carry important implications for migrant remittances, which are an important driver of household consumption, investment, poverty reduction and economic growth in the region, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. We would expect remittances to jump in the immediate term, as migrants repatriate their savings before returning to their countries of origin, but inflows would eventually ease as the number of employed expatriates in the US diminishes.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s restrictive immigration policies would also weigh on security and social stability. A more closed US would mean the disappearance of an essential pressure valve for migrant outflows across the region. This would place substantial strain on migrants\u2019 origin and transit countries, which would lack the resources to respond, especially as Mr Trump would probably discontinue development and technical assistance programmes that the Biden administration has introduced. Mexico in particular would come under pressure to play a larger role in border security, potentially under tariff threats from Mr Trump. As part of a more muscular border security policy, Mr Trump has already threatened unilateral military action to eliminate Mexico\u2019s drug cartels; we view such unprecedented attacks as unlikely, although rhetoric of this kind would keep bilateral relations tense during his term.",
    "Inflation under Mr Trump would delay monetary easing in some countries",
    "Higher inflation under Mr Trump would put upward pressure on regional borrowing costs, although this would affect some countries more than others.\u00a0Higher US production and energy costs,\u00a0a stronger US dollar\u00a0and greater volatility for emerging-market currencies (especially the Mexican peso) would keep inflation higher than would be the case under a Harris administration. This, along with a slower pace of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank), would give Latin American central banks less space to continue their policy normalisation cycles. The impact would be more limited for the many economies that\u00a0began this process early\u00a0and more pronounced for those that have loosened policy more slowly,\u00a0such as Mexico. Higher US bond yields would also put pressure on the region\u2019s sovereign- and corporate-financing plans, but we think that this would mostly be at the margin.\u00a0A risk to this benign forecast is an erosion of the Fed\u2019s independence under Mr Trump, in order to cut interest rates despite above-target inflation, as he has threatened. However,\u00a0we view this as a\u00a0low-probability scenario.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s foreign policy would complicate US relations with most of the region",
    "A Trump foreign policy, which we would expect to be more erratic and unilateral than Ms Harris\u2019s approach, would present challenges for most governments in the region.\u00a0Mr Trump would deprioritise the Biden administration\u2019s efforts at democracy promotion and multilateral engagement, although these were often tepidly received. More consequential would be Mr Trump\u2019s\u00a0less compromising\u00a0approach to China, including that country\u2019s growing economic engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean (although we expect US-China tensions to worsen regardless of the election result). This would make it more difficult for countries to maximise their national interests by balancing relations between the two superpowers, particularly as the US becomes a less reliable partner. However, governments would also have to contend with\u00a0growing dumping risks\u00a0from China, as its cheap exports seek out new markets to sidestep US trade restrictions, to the detriment of the region\u2019s industrial competitiveness. Tougher sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela are also likely under Mr Trump, although this would only encourage outward migration from these countries as economic conditions deteriorate.",
    "Latin American and Caribbean economies would be vulnerable to a\u00a0step back in US leadership\u00a0on global climate issues under Mr Trump, given the region\u2019s\u00a0high exposure\u00a0to climate-change-related disasters. This would particularly complicate US ties with Brazil, given that the South American country is hosting the COP30 climate summit in 2025, although we would expect US relations with the region\u2019s leftist governments to sour more generally.\u00a0Right-wing governments might see some upside in a Trump presidency, although opportunities to draw meaningful benefits would be mixed.\u00a0Argentina, for example, might be able to develop a better foothold in US-led multilateral institutions, such as the IMF. Panama\u2019s new conservative government, which aims to stem irregular migration across its borders, may also find a useful collaborator in Mr Trump. Meanwhile, El Salvador looks set to remain the target of Mr Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric, despite its government\u2019s aggressive crackdown on criminal activity.",
