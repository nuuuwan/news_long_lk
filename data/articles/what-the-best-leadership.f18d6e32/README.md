Executive teams have been a consuming focus of many CEOs and those leading parts of large enterprises for good reason. One study of 1,250 executive teams shows a clear correlation between a company’s performance (revenue, profitability, and shareholder return) and strong executive team performance. But only 20% of executive teams in that study were shown to be high performing.

Top leaders intuitively understand that when their team functions well, it has a positive ripple effect across the organization. But when they struggle to work well together, that same ripple effect can create company-wide misalignment and confusion.

As it turns out, the factors that allow top teams to have outsized impact on enterprise performance are the same ones that make its effectiveness such a challenge. For one thing, they face both external pressures from competing stakeholders like customers, shareholders, and financial markets while also having to contend with internal competition for resources, the limited capital available for too many priorities, and the tensions between their massive day jobs and their roles on the executive team. And because each member is the embodiment of their function (if you’re the chief marketing officer, you are marketing) as well as a face of the enterprise, the team’s visible actions and internal dynamics become a spectator sport for the rest of the organization. Further, the fact that the CEO is also the team leader makes the distribution of power a zero-sum game.

Given the unique responsibilities of executive teams, it would seem obvious that they require a specialized set of skills and approaches to be effective. And yet few have cracked the code on building and sustaining such effectiveness. Their distinctive forms of dysfunction have been commonly chronicled — for example, they often avoid conflict and have unhealthy rivalry, bloated membership, and unfocused agendas.

In our experience working with hundreds of executive teams over the last two decades, we’ve discovered three critical, highly interdependent roles they must play to have lasting impact on the company’s performance, culture, and ability to adapt. We’ve observed that executive teams often perform one or two of these reasonably well but fall short in integrating all three. The good news is that, with persistent effort, executive teams willing to put in the work can learn to play all three of these roles — setting themselves apart from the many willing to settle for much less.

1. They set competitive direction and secure resources.

Like air traffic controllers guiding hundreds of aircraft into and out of a busy airport, the executive team’s role in steering the organization toward a defined future, mobilizing the needed resources to get there, and narrowing focus to stay on course is fraught with risk. It takes discipline to say no to even good opportunities to protect the investment returns of scarce talent and capital. And it takes ruthless self-honesty to articulate a competitive positioning that keeps the organization grounded in reality, focused on sustaining real differentiation versus mere marketing hype.

Where executive teams fall short

But many executive teams lack such courageous self-honesty. Setting focused, clear direction is often usurped by the executive team turning into the “Company U.N.”: Instead of enterprise leaders with a shared agenda, you have “the ambassador from marketing” or “the ambassador from Asia-Pacific” there to exclusively represent the interests of those they lead. This turns the executive team into a lobbying platform where backroom horse-trading replaces sound decision-making and transparent tradeoffs. It often results in overly convoluted strategic plans that lack actual strategy, overloaded with expensive initiatives that require more capacity than the organization has and metrics that, in aggregate, diametrically oppose one another.

In one organization we worked with, the executive team was contemplating a major acquisition that, on paper, could have added complementary offerings and markets to their portfolio. There was tremendous pressure from several members of the team to pursue the deal. But the CEO, taking a long view, said: “We can’t keep chasing shiny objects to satisfy our short-term appetite. Does anyone here really believe we could successfully integrate these products and customers into our existing portfolio without destabilizing our core?” He knew they had more fundamental things to work on and refused to allow them to be distracted by what he called “another magic bullet.”

In our organization assessment for another client, our interviews revealed at least six different versions of the enterprise’s strategic priorities. The team was astonished to see just how misaligned they were, lacking any shared understanding of how the organization could win in their respective markets. Over the course of our work, we helped them articulate and validate four competitive differentiators and five competitive capabilities around which they would exclusively prioritize their capital and talent investments. This dramatically reduced the clutter on their agenda and concentrated their strategic conversations on driving growth through the priorities they’d defined together. While they struggled at first with staying within the boundaries they’d set, eventually they developed the discipline to respect and guard them. Over the 18 months that followed, their profitability grew by 11% and their previously stagnant stock price grew by 14%, which was exceptional for their industry.

2. They shape healthy culture by building relationships and modeling values.

Executive teams must think of themselves not only as “stewards” of the enterprise culture and value system, responsible for defining and reinforcing a particular set of norms — they must be aware that they embody that culture. Their actions speak louder than their words when it comes to reinforcing or diminishing a set of cultural norms.

Successful executive teams articulate an operating philosophy aligned with their strategy, not a set of pie-in-the-sky platitudes that look nice on paper but feel irrelevant to the daily operation of the organization. They believe that by investing in relationships with each other and across the enterprise they can further embed a culture that supports success. That’s because healthy, trusting relationships among the executive team create broader organizational safety needed to welcome dissenting voices and differing viewpoints, leading to deeper insights and shared ownership of decisions. They understand that how they handle conflict serves as a model for the rest of the organization.

Where executive teams fall short

Sadly, commitment to modeling a healthy culture seems rare. One study by Gallup found that only 27% of employees believe in their company’s values and only 23% think they could actually apply them to their jobs. And McKinsey’s State of the Workplace study found that only 25% of employees experience their leaders as inspiring them by example to be their best.

This suggests that executive teams don’t understand that, in order to align the organization, they must exemplify cohesion among themselves. This makes sense considering many executive teams are constructed around perceived “fixed pie” rewards that tear at the foundations of trust.

Culture-shaping executive teams regularly assess the strength of their cultures, starting with themselves. They invite feedback about their individual and collective leadership. Asking “How could I/we have done that better?” becomes their norm. This ensures they sustain the competence and commitment needed to embody the values they’ve declared.

One executive team we worked with, whose organization espoused “innovation and creativity” as a value, deliberately constructed their dialogues to include “dueling fact bases” and contrarian views. They believed conflict was the raw material of innovation and wanted to enable the organization to safely invite contrasting views while maintaining positive relationships. Their culture’s history of conflict aversion, back-channel gossiping, and collusion would have suffocated any efforts to innovate had they not convincingly introduced new behavior.

We also recently worked with an executive team where market shifts, promotions, and retirements had turned over 60% of the team’s longstanding leaders. The newly reformulated team was faced with leading a significant transformation of the business to match the rapidly changing market that had been remade by new entrants. The new team hadn’t had sufficient time to develop the trust needed for the enormity of the task, so we helped them dive deep into their own orientation to trust: What made them extend or withhold it? How much trust would they need to build within the organization for the challenges ahead? Together, they each discovered their inner barriers to trusting others, were vulnerable enough to acknowledge them, and made commitments to overcome them. This laid the groundwork for a culture that could embrace new behaviors because the organization saw their leaders modeling the way and making a clear connection between the values they were espousing and the actions needed to be successful in their transformation.

3. They establish disciplined governance to synchronize performance.

Finally, with the orchestration skills of a master conductor, executive teams must set a productive rhythm and pace for the business. Through a well-constructed system of governance, leaders guide the flow of information, allocating resources to support the countless requirements for coordination across the enterprise.

Simply stated, governance is the act of regularly bringing together the right roles, aligned against clear priorities, and equipping them with the right data and authority to make informed decisions and to hold the organization accountable for execution. Ultimately, well-run governance aligns the organization, ensuring that all consequential decisions are consistent with the organization’s stated objectives.

Where executive teams fall short

Sadly, too many leadership teams struggle to establish sufficient governance to keep their organizations focused and moving forward. Despite their best intentions, they get mired in too many priorities, fail to clarify decision rights, follow undisciplined resource-allocation processes, and poorly document (then fail to communicate) outcomes.

One of the most common shortfalls is maintaining bloated membership. This “more is better” trend toward greater inclusion, usually justified by the complexities of industry dynamics or wide portfolios, denies the reality that too many leaders seated at any governance table creates unwieldy dynamics as the number of relationships to manage increases. An executive team of 15, for example, sets in motion more than 100 different relationships to be managed. This dilutes the trust that enables individuals with differing views to debate vigorously but then support the conclusions they collectively reach. Despite the potential for governance to become a highly leverageable tool, executive teams often become the source of its widespread failure.

For too many companies, this essential aspect of organizational life feels insufferable, particularly for executives whose calendars are consistently double and triple booked.

For one global consumer products client we worked with, our assessment revealed an unusually intense degree of frustration over the amount of time consumed by useless meetings, leaving “only evenings to do our day jobs,” according to one interviewee. The top 500 leaders collectively spent more than 57,000 hours per year in recurring meetings, the equivalent of six and a half years! The executive team had unwittingly abandoned their governance responsibilities. Motivated by the assessment, they eliminated hundreds of unnecessary standing meetings, redeploying thousands of hours of capacity toward clearly defined priorities.

Bringing the roles together

As the figure below illustrates, the power behind these three roles is the outcomes they produce in combination with one another. At the intersection of shaping a healthy culture, setting competitive direction, and securing resources, organizations experience a greater measure of cohesion: the broad sense of unity that comes from feeling deeply connected to those we work with, and the sense that we’re all moving together in the same direction.

The combination of setting competitive direction and disciplined governance yields the vital but often elusive experience of organizational clarity. Instead of people feeling confused about where their authority starts and stops and how it all ladders up to the bigger picture, people in the organization have the confidence to make choices they know connect to the organization’s most important priorities.

And lastly, the roles of disciplined governance and shaping healthy culture produce the organization’s capacity to execute. People feel no need to see each other as rivals, competing for their own agendas. Rather, they see each other as allies, all contributing to the performance results they collectively want. And all three roles produce the fulcrum of trust: the glue that keeps the organization moving forward because everyone knows where they’re going, what part they play in getting there, and are confident in and committed to the in the people they’re going with.

To be sure, the demands of leading an enterprise can be unrelenting. To do it well entails playing three sophisticated, integrated roles requiring a complex range of capabilities. It’s understandable that so many have obsessed over how to increase the effectiveness of executive teams — their disproportionate impact on a company’s performance is immense, and the frequency of their underperformance disturbing. But if you want an enterprise that is aligned, cohesive, and can execute, all while protecting a culture enveloped by trust, this is the price of admission.
