    "Americans don\u2019t agree on much these days. Yet even at a time when consensus reality seems to be on the verge of collapse, there remains at least one quintessentially modern value we can all still get behind: creativity.\u00a0 We teach it, measure it, envy it, cultivate it, and endlessly worry about its death. And why wouldn\u2019t we? Most of us are taught from a young age that creativity is the key to everything from finding personal fulfillment to achieving career success to solving the world\u2019s thorniest problems. Over the years, we\u2019ve built creative industries, creative spaces, and creative cities and populated them with an entire class of people known simply as \u201ccreatives.\u201d We read thousands of books and articles each year that teach us how to unleash, unlock, foster, boost, and hack our own personal creativity. Then we read even more to learn how to manage and protect this precious resource.\u00a0 Related StoryWhat happened when 20 comedians got AI to write their routines\u201cI\u2019ve tried to prompt AI to be funny or surprising or interesting or creative, but it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d",
    "Given how much we obsess over it, the concept of creativity can feel like something that has always existed, a thing philosophers and artists have pondered and debated throughout the ages. While it\u2019s a reasonable assumption, it\u2019s one that turns out to be very wrong. As Samuel Franklin explains in his recent book, The Cult of Creativity, the first known written use of creativity didn\u2019t actually occur until 1875, \u201cmaking it an infant as far as words go.\u201d What\u2019s more, he writes, before about 1950, \u201cthere were approximately zero articles, books, essays, treatises, odes, classes, encyclopedia entries, or anything of the sort dealing explicitly with the subject of \u2018creativity.\u2019\u201d This raises some obvious questions. How exactly did we go from never talking about creativity to always talking about it? What, if anything, distinguishes creativity from other, older words, like ingenuity, cleverness, imagination, and artistry? Maybe most important: How did everyone from kindergarten teachers to mayors, CEOs, designers, engineers, activists, and starving artists come to believe that creativity isn\u2019t just good\u2014personally, socially, economically\u2014but the answer to all life\u2019s problems?",
    "Thankfully, Franklin offers some potential answers in his book. A historian and design researcher at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, he argues that the concept of creativity as we now know it emerged during the post\u2013World War II era in America as a kind of cultural salve\u2014a way to ease the tensions and anxieties caused by increasing conformity, bureaucracy, and suburbanization. \u201cTypically defined as a kind of trait or process vaguely associated with artists and geniuses but theoretically possessed by anyone and applicable to any field, [creativity] provided a way to unleash individualism within order,\u201d he writes, \u201cand revive the spirit of the lone inventor within the maze of the modern corporation.\u201d",
    "Brainstorming, a new method for encouraging creative thinking, swept corporate America in the 1950s. A response to pressure for new products and new ways of marketing them, as well as a panic over conformity, it inspired passionate debate about whether true creativity should be an individual affair or could be systematized for corporate use.INSTITUTE OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY/THE MONACELLI PRESS   I spoke to Franklin about why we continue to be so fascinated by creativity, how Silicon Valley became the supposed epicenter of it, and what role, if any, technologies like AI might have in reshaping our relationship with it.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious what your personal relationship to creativity was growing up. What made you want to write a book about it? Like a lot of kids, I grew up thinking that creativity was this inherently good thing. For me\u2014and I imagine for a lot of other people who, like me, weren\u2019t particularly athletic or good at math and science\u2014being creative meant you at least had some future in this world, even if it wasn\u2019t clear what that future would entail. By the time I got into college and beyond, the conventional wisdom among the TED Talk register of thinkers\u2014people like Daniel Pink and Richard Florida\u2014was that creativity was actually the most important trait to have for the future. Basically, the creative people were going to inherit the Earth, and society desperately needed them if we were going to solve all of these compounding problems in the world.\u00a0 On the one hand, as someone who liked to think of himself as creative, it was hard not to be flattered by this. On the other hand, it all seemed overhyped to me. What was being sold as the triumph of the creative class wasn\u2019t actually resulting in a more inclusive or creative world order. What\u2019s more, some of the values embedded in what I call the cult of creativity seemed increasingly problematic\u2014specifically, the focus on self-\u00adrealization, doing what you love, and following your passion. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014it\u2019s a beautiful vision, and I saw it work out for some people. But I also started to feel like it was just a cover for what was, economically speaking, a pretty bad turn of events for many people.\u00a0\u00a0  Staff members at the University of California\u2019s Institute of Personality Assessment and Research simulate a situational procedure involving group interaction, called the Bingo Test. Researchers of the 1950s hoped to learn how factors in people\u2019s lives and environments shaped their creative aptitude.INSTITUTE OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY/THE MONACELLI PRESS   Nowadays, it\u2019s quite common to bash the \u201cfollow your passion,\u201d \u201chustle culture\u201d idea. But back when I started this project, the whole move-fast-and-break-things, disrupter, innovation-economy stuff was very much unquestioned. In a way, the idea for the book came from recognizing that creativity was playing this really interesting role in connecting two worlds: this world of innovation and entrepreneurship and this more soulful, bohemian side of our culture. I wanted to better understand the history of that relationship. When did you start thinking about creativity as a kind of cult\u2014one that we\u2019re all a part of?\u00a0 Similar to something like the \u201ccult of domesticity,\u201d it was a way of describing a historical moment in which an idea or value system achieves a kind of broad, uncritical acceptance. I was finding that everyone was selling stuff based on the idea that it boosted your creativity, whether it was a new office layout, a new kind of urban design, or the \u201cTry these five simple tricks\u201d type of thing.\u00a0 You start to realize that nobody is bothering to ask, \u201cHey, uh, why do we all need to be creative again? What even is this thing, creativity?\u201d It had become this unimpeachable value that no one, regardless of what side of the political spectrum they fell on, would even think to question. That, to me, was really unusual, and I think it signaled that something interesting was happening.",
    "Your book highlights midcentury efforts by psychologists to turn creativity into a quantifiable mental trait and the \u201ccreative person\u201d into an identifiable type. How did that play out?\u00a0 The short answer is: not very well. To study anything, you of course need to agree on what it is you\u2019re looking at. Ultimately, I think these groups of psychologists were frustrated in their attempts to come up with scientific criteria that defined a creative person. One technique was to go find people who were already eminent in fields that were deemed creative\u2014writers like Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, architects like Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen\u2014and just give them a battery of cognitive and psychoanalytic tests and then write up the results. This was mostly done by an outfit called the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research (IPAR) at Berkeley. Frank Barron and Don MacKinnon were the two biggest researchers in that group.

    "Another way psychologists went about it was to say, all right, that\u2019s not going to be practical for coming up with a good scientific standard. We need numbers, and lots and lots of people to certify these creative criteria. This group of psychologists theorized that something called \u201cdivergent thinking\u201d was a major component of creative accomplishment. You\u2019ve heard of the brick test, where you\u2019re asked to come up with many creative uses for a brick in a given amount of time? They basically gave a version of that test to Army officers, schoolchildren, rank-and-file engineers at General Electric, all kinds of people. It\u2019s tests like those that ultimately became stand-ins for what it means to be \u201ccreative.\u201d Are they still used?\u00a0  When you see a headline about AI making people more creative, or actually being more creative than humans, the tests they are basing that assertion on are almost always some version of a divergent thinking test. It\u2019s highly problematic for a number of reasons. Chief among them is the fact that these tests have never been shown to have predictive value\u2014that\u2019s to say, a third grader, a 21-year-old, or a 35-year-old who does really well on divergent thinking tests doesn\u2019t seem to have any greater likelihood of being successful in creative pursuits. The whole point of developing these tests in the first place was to both identify and predict creative people. None of them have been shown to do that.\u00a0 Reading your book, I was struck by how vague and, at times, contradictory the concept of \u201ccreativity\u201d was from the beginning. You characterize that as \u201ca feature, not a bug.\u201d How so? Ask any creativity expert today what they mean by \u201ccreativity,\u201d and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the ability to generate something new and useful. That something could be an idea, a product, an academic paper\u2014whatever. But the focus on novelty has remained an aspect of creativity from the beginning. It\u2019s also what distinguishes it from other similar words, like imagination or cleverness. But you\u2019re right: Creativity is a flexible enough concept to be used in all sorts of ways and to mean all sorts of things, many of them contradictory. I think I write in the book that the term may not be precise, but that it\u2019s vague in precise and meaningful ways. It can be both playful and practical, artsy and technological, exceptional and pedestrian. That was and remains a big part of its appeal.\u00a0  The question of \u201cCan machines be \u2018truly creative\u2019?\u201d is not that interesting, but the questions of \u201cCan they be wise, honest, caring?\u201d are more important if we\u2019re going to be welcoming [AI] into our lives as advisors and assistants.  Is that emphasis on novelty and utility a part of why Silicon Valley likes to think of itself as the new nexus for creativity?",
    "Absolutely. The two criteria go together. In techno-solutionist, hypercapitalist milieus like Silicon Valley, novelty isn\u2019t any good if it\u2019s not useful (or at least marketable), and utility isn\u2019t any good (or marketable) unless it\u2019s also novel. That\u2019s why they\u2019re often dismissive of boring-but-important things like craft, infrastructure, maintenance, and incremental improvement, and why they support art\u2014which is traditionally defined by its resistance to utility\u2014only insofar as it\u2019s useful as inspiration for practical technologies. At the same time, Silicon Valley loves to wrap itself in \u201ccreativity\u201d because of all the artsy and individualist connotations. It has very self-consciously tried to distance itself from the image of the buttoned-down engineer working for a large R&D lab of a brick-and-mortar manufacturing corporation and instead raise up the idea of a rebellious counterculture type tinkering in a garage making weightless products and experiences. That, I think, has saved it from a lot of public scrutiny.",
    "Up until recently, we\u2019ve tended to think of creativity as a human trait, maybe with a few exceptions from the rest of the animal world. Is AI changing that? When people started defining creativity in the \u201950s, the threat of computers automating white-collar work was already underway. They were basically saying, okay, rational and analytical thinking is no longer ours alone. What can we do that the computers can never do? And the assumption was that humans alone could be \u201ctruly creative.\u201d For a long time, computers didn\u2019t do much to really press the issue on what that actually meant. Now they\u2019re pressing the issue. Can they do art and poetry? Yes. Can they generate novel products that also make sense or work? Sure. I think that\u2019s by design. The kinds of LLMs that Silicon Valley companies have put forward are meant to appear \u201ccreative\u201d in those conventional senses. Now, whether or not their products are meaningful or wise in a deeper sense, that\u2019s another question. If we\u2019re talking about art, I happen to think embodiment is an important element. Nerve endings, hormones, social instincts, morality, intellectual honesty\u2014those are not things essential to \u201ccreativity\u201d necessarily, but they are essential to putting things out into the world that are good, and maybe even beautiful in a certain antiquated sense. That\u2019s why I think the question of \u201cCan machines be \u2018truly creative\u2019?\u201d is not that interesting, but the questions of \u201cCan they be wise, honest, caring?\u201d are more important if we\u2019re going to be welcoming them into our lives as advisors and assistants.\u00a0 This interview is based on two conversations and has been edited and condensed for clarity.
