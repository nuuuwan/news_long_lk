    "India\u2019s SAGAR vs. China\u2019s BRI: Why our strategic location demands strategic thinking",
    "Our ports, particularly Colombo and Hambantota, are not just infrastructure assets\u2014they are geopolitical leverage points",
    "The Indian Ocean is fast becoming the world\u2019s most contested geopolitical theatre. With two giants\u2014India and China\u2014promoting competing visions of regional order, Sri Lanka finds itself at the centre of a high-stakes maritime chessboard. India\u2019s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are more than development models\u2014they are strategic blueprints shaping the 21st-century Indo-Pacific.",
    "Sri Lanka: Geography is destiny",
    "Few nations are as strategically located as Sri Lanka. Nestled near major international sea lanes, our island sits at the maritime crossroads between East and West. Over 60,000 ships traverse these waters annually, carrying goods, energy, and data. Our ports, particularly Colombo and Hambantota, are not just infrastructure assets\u2014they are geopolitical leverage points.",
    "If wisely navigated, Sri Lanka\u2019s location can become its greatest economic and diplomatic strength. If mismanaged, it can leave us vulnerable to external pressures, debt traps, or the erosion of sovereignty.",
    "India\u2019s SAGAR: Regional harmony or strategic hedging?",
    "Launched in 2015, India\u2019s SAGAR doctrine aims to ensure regional maritime security and economic cooperation. Unlike BRI\u2019s infrastructure-heavy focus, SAGAR presents itself as an inclusive, consultative framework, emphasising collective progress and regional ownership.",
    "India has historical and cultural ties with Sri Lanka, a democratic tradition, and growing technological prowess. Its SAGAR vision invites collaboration in security, blue economy, disaster response, and capacity building. But it is also an attempt to counter China\u2019s growing influence in what India sees as its traditional sphere of influence.The question for Sri Lanka is this: can we extract real economic benefit from SAGAR without being drawn into regional rivalries?",
    "China\u2019s BRI: Opportunity or overreach?",
    "China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative\u2014especially its Maritime Silk Road component\u2014has reshaped infrastructure financing across Asia and Africa. Sri Lanka became one of BRI\u2019s early champions, with massive Chinese investments in roads, ports, and power projects.",
    "Yet, the legacy of these investments is mixed. While China helped finance vital infrastructure, the debt dynamics and long lease of Hambantota Port have raised red flags about economic sovereignty. The BRI, though ambitious, is not charity. It is a projection of Chinese power through financial diplomacy.",
    "As the global backlash against BRI grows, Sri Lanka must ask: how do we ensure that future investments are transparent, sustainable, and truly beneficial to the people?",
    "Strategic non-alignment: The need for a Sri Lankan doctrine",
    "Sri Lanka cannot afford to become a pawn in the strategic contest between India and China. Nor should we view these relationships in zero-sum terms. What we need is a clear foreign policy doctrine\u2014rooted in neutrality, sovereignty, and long-term economic benefit.",
    "Such a doctrine must prioritise multilateralism, regional cooperation with ASEAN and the African Union, and deep engagement with the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). It must also enhance our domestic capacity to negotiate, assess, and manage complex geopolitical engagements.",
    "It\u2019s time to steer our own course",
    "Geopolitical proximity is not destiny unless we let it be. Sri Lanka must stop reacting to external overtures and start acting with a clear sense of national interest. Whether it\u2019s SAGAR or BRI\u2014or any other emerging vision\u2014we must judge all partnerships by the same standard: do they uphold our sovereignty, improve the lives of our people, and help us thrive as a peaceful, resilient Indian Ocean nation?",
    "In the turbulent tides of great power competition, Sri Lanka has a choice: to drift or to steer. The time to steer is now."
