    "ChatGPT can now search the web for up-to-date answers to a user\u2019s queries, OpenAI announced today.\u00a0 Until now, ChatGPT was mostly restricted to generating answers from its training data, which is current up to October 2023 for GPT-4o, and had limited web search capabilities. Searches about generalized topics will still draw on this information from the model itself, but now ChatGPT will automatically search the web in response to queries about recent information such as sports, stocks, or news of the day, and can deliver rich multi-media results. Users can also manually trigger a web search, but for the most part, the chatbot will make its own decision about when an answer would benefit from information taken from the web, says Adam Fry, OpenAI\u2019s product lead for search.  \u201cOur goal is to make ChatGPT the smartest assistant, and now we\u2019re really enhancing its capabilities in terms of what it has access to from the web,\u201d Fry tells MIT Technology Review. The feature is available today for the chatbot\u2019s paying users.\u00a0 ChatGPT triggers a web search when the user asks about local restaurants in this example While ChatGPT search, as it is known, is initially available to paying customers, OpenAI intends to make it available for free later, even when people are logged out. The company also plans to combine search with its voice features and Canvas, its interactive platform for coding and writing, although these capabilities will not be available in today\u2019s initial launch.",
    "The company unveiled a standalone prototype of web search in July. Those capabilities are now built directly into the chatbot. OpenAI says it has \u201cbrought the best of the SearchGPT experience into ChatGPT.\u201d\u00a0 OpenAI is the latest tech company to debut an AI-powered search assistant, challenging similar tools from competitors such as Google, Microsoft, and startup Perplexity. Meta, too, is reportedly developing its own AI search engine. As with Perplexity\u2019s interface, users of ChatGPT search can interact with the chatbot in natural language, and it will offer an AI-generated answer with sources and links to further reading. In contrast, Google\u2019s AI Overviews offer a short AI-generated summary at the top of the website, as well as a traditional list of indexed links.",

    "These new tools could eventually challenge Google\u2019s 90% market share in online search. AI search is a very important way to draw more users, says Chirag Shah, a professor at the University of Washington, who specializes in online search. But he says it is unlikely to chip away at Google\u2019s search dominance. Microsoft\u2019s high-profile attempt with Bing barely made a dent in the market, Shah says.\u00a0 Instead, OpenAI is trying to create a new market for more powerful and interactive AI agents, which can take complex actions in the real world, Shah says.\u00a0 The new search function in ChatGPT is a step toward these agents.\u00a0 It can also deliver highly contextualized responses that take advantage of chat histories, allowing users to go deeper in a search. Currently, ChatGPT search is able to recall conversation histories and continue the conversation with questions on the same topic.\u00a0  ChatGPT itself can also remember things about users that it can use later \u2014sometimes it does this automatically, or you can ask it to remember something. Those \u201clong-term\u201d memories affect how it responds to chats. Search doesn\u2019t have this yet\u2014a new web search starts from scratch\u2014 but it should get this capability in the \u201cnext couple of quarters,\u201d says Fry. When it does, OpenAI says it will allow it to deliver far more personalized results based on what it knows. \u201cThose might be persistent memories, like \u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u2019 or it might be contextual, like \u2018I\u2019m going to New York in the next few days,\u2019\u201d says Fry. \u201cIf you say \u2018I\u2019m going to New York in four days,\u2019 it can remember that fact and the nuance of that point,\u201d he adds.\u00a0 To help develop ChatGPT\u2019s web search, OpenAI says it leveraged its partnerships with news organizations such as Reuters, the Atlantic, Le Monde, the Financial Times, Axel Springer, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and Time. However, its results include information not only from these publishers, but any other source online that does not actively block its search crawler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a positive development that ChatGPT will now be able to retrieve information from these reputable online sources and generate answers based on them, says Suzan Verberne, a professor of natural-language processing at Leiden University, who has studied information retrieval. It also allows users to ask follow-up questions.",

    "But despite the enhanced ability to search the web and cross-check sources, the tool is not immune from the persistent tendency of AI language models to make things up or get it wrong. When MIT Technology Review tested the new search function and asked it for vacation destination ideas, ChatGPT suggested \u201cluxury European destinations\u201d such as Japan, Dubai, the Caribbean islands, Bali, the Seychelles, and Thailand. It offered as a source an article from the Times, a British newspaper, which listed these locations as well as those in Europe as luxury holiday options. \u201cEspecially when you ask about untrue facts or events that never happened, the engine might still try to formulate a plausible response that is not necessarily correct,\u201d says Verberne. There is also a risk that misinformation might seep into ChatGPT\u2019s answers from the internet if the company has not filtered its sources well enough, she adds.\u00a0 Another risk is that the current push to access the web through AI search will disrupt the internet\u2019s digital economy, argues Benjamin Brooks, a fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Berkman Klein Center, who previously led public policy for Stability AI, in an op-ed published by\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u00a0today. \u201cBy shielding the web behind an all-knowing chatbot, AI search could deprive creators of the visits and \u2018eyeballs\u2019 they need to survive,\u201d Brooks writes.  hide"
