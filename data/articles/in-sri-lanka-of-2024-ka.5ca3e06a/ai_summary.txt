This article discusses the current situation in Sri Lanka, focusing on the government's treatment of Tamils and the country's ongoing militarism. It criticises the rule of the Rajapaksa family, stating that their regime acted with indifference towards the killing of Tamils during their fight against the Tamil Tigers. It also accuses the Rajapaksas of demonising Muslims after the civil war and argues that their militaristic policies have led to the country's economic difficulties. Furthermore, it criticises the fact that many of the country's "war heroes" have now become mercenaries in conflicts abroad, such as Russia's war on Ukraine. The article calls for Sri Lanka to move away from "Sinhala supremacism" and militarism in order to achieve peace and prosperity.
