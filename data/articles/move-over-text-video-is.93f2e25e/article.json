    "The other day I idly opened TikTok to find a video of a young woman refinishing an old hollow-bodied electric guitar. It was a montage of close-up shots\u2014looking over her shoulder as she sanded and scraped the wood, peeled away the frets, expertly patched the cracks with filler, and then spray-painted it a radiant purple. She compressed days of work into a tight 30-second clip. It was mesmerizing.  Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only video I saw that day. In barely another five minutes of swiping around, I saw a historian discussing the songs Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings; a sailor puzzling over a capsized boat he\u2019d found deep at sea; a tearful mother talking about parenting a child with ADHD; a Latino man laconically describing a dustup with his racist neighbor; and a linguist discussing how Gen Z uses video-game metaphors in everyday life. I could go on. I will! And so, probably, will you. This is what the internet looks like now. It used to be a preserve of text and photos\u2014but increasingly, it is a forest of video.",
    "This is one of the most profound technology shifts that will define our future: We are entering the age of the moving image. For centuries, when everyday people had to communicate at a distance, they really had only two options. They could write something down; they could send a picture. The moving image was too expensive to shoot, edit, and disseminate. Only pros could wield it.",

    "The smartphone, the internet, and social networks like TikTok have rapidly and utterly transformed this situation. It\u2019s now common, when someone wants to hurl an idea into the world, not to pull out a keyboard and type but to turn on a camera and talk. For many young people, video might be the prime way to express ideas. As media thinkers like Marshall McLuhan have intoned, a new medium changes us. It changes the way we learn, the way we think\u2014and what we think about. When mass printing emerged, it helped create a culture of news, mass literacy, and bureaucracy, and\u2014some argue\u2014the very idea of scientific evidence. So how will mass video shift our culture? For starters, I\u2019d argue, it is helping us share knowledge that used to be damnably hard to capture in text. I\u2019m a long-distance cyclist, for example, and if I need to fix my bike, I don\u2019t bother reading a guide. I look for a video explainer. If you\u2019re looking to express\u2014or absorb\u2014knowledge that\u2019s visual, physical, or proprioceptive, the moving image nearly always wins. Athletes don\u2019t read a textual description of what they did wrong in the last game; they watch the clips. Hence the wild popularity, on video platforms, of instructional video\u2014makeup tutorials, cooking demonstrations. (Or even learn-to-code material: I learned Python by watching coders do it.) Video also is no longer about mere broadcast, but about conversation\u2014it\u2019s a way to respond to others, notes Raven Maragh-Lloyd, the author of Black Networked Resistance and a professor of film and media studies at Washington University. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a rise of audience participation,\u201d she notes, including people doing \u201cduets\u201d on TikTok or response videos on YouTube. Everyday creators see video platforms as ways to talk back to power.   \u201cMy students were like, \u2018If there\u2019s a video over seven seconds, we\u2019re not watching it.\u2019\u201d Brianna Wiens, Waterloo University There\u2019s also an increasingly sophisticated lexicon of visual styles. Today\u2019s video creators riff on older film aesthetics to make their points. Brianna Wiens, an assistant professor of digital media and rhetoric at Waterloo University, says she admired how a neuroscientist used stop-motion video, a technique from the early days of film, to produce TikTok discussions of vaccines during the height of the covid-19 pandemic. Or consider the animated GIF, which channels the \u201czoetrope\u201d of the 1800s, looping a short moment in time to examine over and over. Indeed, as video becomes more woven into the vernacular of daily life, it\u2019s both expanding and contracting in size. There are streams on Twitch where you can watch someone for hours\u2014and viral videos where someone compresses an idea into mere seconds. Those latter ones have a particular rhetorical power because they\u2019re so ingestible. \u201cI was teaching a class called Digital Lives, and my students were like, If there\u2019s a video over seven seconds, we\u2019re not watching it,\u201d Wiens says, laughing. Are there dangers ahead as use of the moving image grows? Possibly. Maybe it will too powerfully reward people with the right visual and physical charisma. (Not necessarily a novel danger: Text and radio had their own versions.) More subtly, video is technologically still adolescent. It\u2019s not yet easy to search, or to clip and paste and annotate and collate\u2014to use video for quietly organizing our thoughts, the way we do with text. Until those tool sets emerge (and you can see that beginning), its power will be limited. Lastly, maybe the moving image will become so common and go-to that\u2019ll kill off print culture.

    "Media scholars are not terribly stressed about this final danger. New forms of media rarely kill off older ones. Indeed, as the late priest and scholar Walter Ong pointed out, creating television and radio requires writing plenty of text\u2014all those scripts. Today\u2019s moving-media culture is possibly even more saturated with writing. Videos on Instagram and TikTok often include artfully arranged captions, \u201cdiegetic\u201d text commenting on the action, or data visualizations. You read while you watch; write while you shoot.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re getting into all kinds of interesting hybrids and relationships,\u201d notes Lev Manovich, a professor at the City University of New York. The tool sets for sculpting and editing video will undoubtedly improve too, perhaps using AI to help auto-edit, redact, summarize.\u00a0 One firm, Reduct, already offers a clever trick: You alter a video by editing the transcript. Snip out a sentence, and it snips out the related visuals. Public defenders use it to parse and edit police videos. They\u2019re often knee-deep in the stuff\u2014the advent of body cameras worn by officers has produced an ocean of footage, as Reduct\u2019s CEO, Robert Ochshorn, tells me.\u00a0 Meanwhile, generative AI will make it easier to create a film out of pure imagination. This means, of course, that we\u2019ll see a new flood of visual misinformation. We\u2019ll need to develop a sharper culture of finding the useful amid the garbage. It took print a couple of centuries to do that, as scholars of the book will tell you\u2014centuries during which the printing press helped spark untold war and upheaval. We\u2019ll be living through the same process with the moving image. So strap yourselves in. Whatever else happens, it\u2019ll be interesting.\u00a0 Clive Thompson is the author of Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World. hide"
