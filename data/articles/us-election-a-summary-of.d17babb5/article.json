    "US election: a summary of our views",
    "ElectionsForecastingPoliticsUS electionAmericasUnited StatesCountry Analysis",
    "The US election is a pivotal event, with wide-ranging implications for the US and global economies.\u00a0We believe that the closely fought contest between the current Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former Republican president, Donald Trump, is a\u00a0toss-up. We have been exploring the implications of the contest for the US and globally in our \u201cUS election: its impact on\u2026\u201d series captured under our US 2024 elections theme. Our key views are summarised below.",
    "Impact on the US economy, policy and business sectors",
    "We see some divergence in US macroeconomic outcomes under the rival presidencies.\u00a0In both cases, we still expect the US economy to remain fundamentally strong. However, under Mr\u00a0Trump we would expect slightly weaker economic growth, higher inflation and a wider fiscal deficit than under Ms\u00a0Harris. Consequently, we would expect a less smooth path to lower US interest rates under Mr\u00a0Trump than under his rival, and probably a stronger US dollar as a result. The divergence mainly relates to likely differences in approach to trade, immigration and\u00a0taxes.",
    "Trade: Ms Harris would retain a protectionist tilt in US trade policy, with a primary focus on China. Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s administration would seek broad application of tariffs and, although pushback from US businesses and trading partners will result in a watering down of proposals, we expect executive orders to force the adoption of some higher rates. These tariffs would increase prices for US consumers and also affect US exports as other economies respond with\u00a0countermeasures.",
    "Immigration: policy towards immigration will tighten under either candidate, but Ms\u00a0Harris would probably favour enhancing legal migration pathways, whereas Mr\u00a0Trump would prioritise limiting immigration across the board. We see greater risk of labour market disruption and tightening under Mr Trump, with the effect of applying firmer upward pressure on\u00a0prices.",
    "Tax: neither candidate is anxious about the wide US fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, with Ms\u00a0Harris\u2019s plans to raise revenue through higher corporation taxes and the phasing out of personal income tax cuts, the shortfall is likely to be narrower. Mr\u00a0Trump hopes to make those tax cuts permanent, and although deregulation is a major campaign theme, he has not been drawn on specific offsetting spending\u00a0cuts.",
    "Competition with China drives bipartisan consensus on some, but not all, domestic industrial and sectoral policies. Industrial policy and re- (or near-) shoring aspirations will remain central themes under either presidency, driven by competition with China. Mr\u00a0Trump would probably tweak support for clean energy but maintain subsidies for semiconductors and technology; Ms\u00a0Harris would largely continue current policies. Under either presidency, we expect that major domestic legislation will struggle to make its way through what\u00a0we think is likely to be a divided Congress. Still, through executive actions and other measures, there will be scope to influence outcomes, and we expect some of the following sectoral impacts.",
    "Automotive: Ms Harris would focus on reducing vehicle emissions by tightening fuel economy standards, encouraging electric vehicle (EV) adoption and boosting investment in US manufacturing of EVs, semiconductors and batteries. Mr\u00a0Trump\u00a0would pull back goals for reducing vehicle emissions, and his anti-China stance could slow the shift towards\u00a0EVs.",
    "Consumer goods and retail: A Harris victory would continue an anti-trust approach to regulation, ensuring continuing scrutiny on businesses to keep prices low for consumers. A Trump victory would probably lead to a more pro-business regulatory stance, but his tariff and immigration policies would cause disruption for many\u00a0firms.",
    "Energy: Ms Harris would continue with energy transition policies, meaning prioritising the fight against climate change and supporting the adoption of renewable energies, to meet the existing target of having an emission-free power sector by 2035. A Trump administration would weaken environmental regulation and reduce subsidies for renewable energy, while removing barriers to oil and gas\u00a0production.",
    "Financial services: a Harris administration would aim to align the US with global standards and remain vigilant about speculative, abusive or anti-competitive activities. Mr\u00a0Trump would pursue softer rules for banks and other financial firms, including in cryptocurrency, and appoint more industry-friendly\u00a0administrators.",
    "Healthcare: Ms Harris would focus on risk-pooling and expanding access to healthcare, supported by increasing centralisation of the system. For Mr Trump, the priorities are consumer choice and transparency, with many decisions likely to be left to individual states, courts and providers. Ms\u00a0Harris would seek to protect reproductive rights, in contrast to Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s preference for enforcing state-level\u00a0restrictions.",
    "Technology: Mr Trump would probably be more hands-off than Ms\u00a0Harris on competition and artificial intelligence, but stricter restrictions on immigration could affect recruitment in the tech\u00a0sector.",
    "US foreign policy would move in an isolationist direction under Mr\u00a0Trump, but would retain a more traditional bearing under Ms\u00a0Harris.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica-first\u201d agenda would inject uncertainty into key US alliances and partnerships, especially on issues such as defence spending, trade imbalances and China ties. However, his more radical proposals, such as US withdrawal from NATO, are best seen as low-probability risks. Ms\u00a0Harris would apply pressure on similar issues, but in the context of fuller support for long-standing relationships in Asia and Europe. There would be less US support for multilateral organisations under Mr Trump, and he would probably pull the US out of international climate negotiations. A Trump administration would focus more on \u201chard\u201d power accumulation through higher defence spending to further US interests, whereas a Harris administration would retain \u201csoft\u201d power tools such as development and aid\u00a0spending.",
    "Impact on the global economy and geopolitics",
    "The US election will have economic and geopolitical implications for the rest of the world.\u00a0Given the higher level of discontinuity that we anticipate under Mr Trump, we explored some of the exposures for other geographies in the Trump Risk Index. This highlighted the vulnerability of US allies and major trading partners to shifts in US trade and security\u00a0policy.",
    "We have also explored specific regional outcomes under both presidencies.",
    "Africa: Both candidates would seek to combat the geostrategic and commercial influence of China and Russia in Africa. Ms\u00a0Harris would commit more to initiatives that support pan-African institutions, the region\u2019s wider development agenda and the drive for greater regional economic integration. Mr\u00a0Trump would focus on securing influence over strategic partners in Africa and access to their natural\u00a0resources",
    "Asia: US security alliances in East Asia would hold under either Ms\u00a0Harris or Mr\u00a0Trump, but demands on allies would rise notably under Mr\u00a0Trump. The China-linked supply chains of South-east Asian economies would come under similar scrutiny, with punitive actions more likely under Mr\u00a0Trump. A stronger US dollar under Mr\u00a0Trump would reignite balance-of-payment pressures for some Asian\u00a0economies.",
    "China: US-China economic disentanglement under Mr\u00a0Trump would be more intense and broad-based than under Ms\u00a0Harris, spreading across a wider subset of industries and areas of co-operation. A more confrontational period with the US would accelerate China\u2019s efforts to stabilise its ties with US allies and improve those with non-Western\u00a0countries.",
    "Europe: We would expect more intense US pressure on European defence spending levels under Mr\u00a0Trump than Ms\u00a0Harris, and also a faster reduction in US aid for Ukraine. A blanket tariff on EU exports to the US would represent a major shock to the European economy, notably that of Germany, and one that we anticipate would elicit a countervailing response from the\u00a0EU.",
    "Latin America: Under Mr Trump, the region would probably face slower economic growth, higher inflation, steeper borrowing costs and more complicated foreign relations, especially regarding China. The regional outlook would be more benign under Ms\u00a0Harris, although we would still expect some tightening of US policies on immigration and China\u00a0ties.",
    "Middle East: The US will remain militarily engaged in the Middle East regardless of the presidential election outcome. Both Ms\u00a0Harris and Mr\u00a0Trump are pressuring Israel to cease military action in Gaza and Lebanon. Mr\u00a0Trump is more likely to align with right-wing Israeli policies, whereas Ms\u00a0Harris may advocate for a two-state solution. Under either administration, Israel will continue to be a key US ally, driven by security concerns in the region, notably\u00a0Iran.",
    "Weaker US growth and the likely intensification of global trade conflicts point to a more challenging global growth outlook under Mr\u00a0Trump than Ms\u00a0Harris. Our analysis suggests that, among major markets, growth prospects would be among the most affected for China, Germany and Mexico under Mr\u00a0Trump. The likelihood of higher US interest rates and a stronger US dollar would also extend local currency strains for some markets and complicate efforts to support local growth through monetary policy\u00a0easing.",
