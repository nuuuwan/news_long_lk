    "Sneha Goenka is one of MIT Technology Review\u2019s 2025 Innovators Under 35.\u00a0Meet the rest of this year\u2019s honorees.\u00a0 Up to a quarter of children entering intensive care have undiagnosed genetic conditions. To be treated properly, they must first get diagnoses\u2014which means having their genomes sequenced. This process typically takes up to seven weeks. Sadly, that\u2019s often too slow to save a critically ill child.  Hospitals may soon have a faster option, thanks to a groundbreaking system built in part by Sneha Goenka, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton\u2014and MIT Technology Review\u2019s 2025 Innovator of the Year.\u00a0 Five years ago, Goenka and her colleagues designed a rapid-sequencing pipeline that can provide a genetic diagnosis in less than eight hours. Goenka\u2019s software computations and hardware architectures were critical to speeding up each stage of the process.",
    "\u201cHer work made everyone realize that genome sequencing is not only for research and medical application in the future but can have immediate impact on patient care,\u201d says Jeroen de Ridder, a professor at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, who has developed an ultrafast sequencing tool for cancer diagnosis.\u00a0 Related StoryAdventures in the genetic time machineAncient DNA is telling us more and more about humans and environments long past.

    "Now, as cofounder and scientific lead of a new company, she is working to make that technology widely available to patients around the world.",
    "Goenka grew up in Mumbai, India. Her mother was an advocate for women\u2019s education, but as a child, Goenka had to fight to persuade other family members to let her continue her studies. She moved away from home at 15 to attend her final two years of school and enroll in a premier test-\u00adpreparation academy in Kota, Rajasthan. Thanks to that education, she passed what she describes as \u201cone of the most competitive exams in the world,\u201d to get into the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.\u00a0 Once admitted to a combined bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s program in electrical engineering, she found that \u201cit was a real boys\u2019 club.\u201d But Goenka excelled in developing computer architecture systems that accelerate computation. As an undergraduate, she began applying those skills to medicine, driven by her desire to \u201chave real-world impact\u201d\u2014in part because she had seen her family struggle with painful uncertainty after her brother was born prematurely when she was eight years old.\u00a0 While working on a PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford, she turned her focus to evolutionary and clinical genomics. One day a senior colleague, Euan Ashley, presented her with a problem. He said, \u201cWe want to see how fast we can make a genetic diagnosis. If you had unlimited funds and resources, just how fast do you think you could make the compute?\u201d Streaming DNA A genetic diagnosis starts with a blood sample, which is prepped to extract the DNA\u2014a process that takes about three hours. Next that DNA needs to be \u201cread.\u201d One of the world\u2019s leading long-read sequencing technologies, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, can generate highly detailed raw data of an individual\u2019s genetic code in about an hour and a half. Unfortunately, processing all this data to identify mutations can take another 21 hours. Shipping samples to a central lab and figuring out which mutations are of interest often leads the process to stretch out to weeks.\u00a0  Goenka saw a better way: Build a real-time system that could \u201cstream\u201d the sequencing data, analyzing it as it was being generated, like streaming a film on Netflix rather than downloading it to watch later.  To do this, she designed a cloud computing architecture to pull in more processing power. Goenka\u2019s first challenge was to increase the speed at which her team could upload the raw data for processing, by streamlining the requests between the sequencer and the cloud to avoid unnecessary \u201cchatter.\u201d She worked out the exact number of communication channels needed\u2014and created algorithms that allowed those channels to be reused in the most efficient way. The next challenge was \u201cbase calling\u201d\u2014converting the raw signal from the sequencing machine into the nucleotide bases A, C, T, and G, the language that makes up our DNA. Rather than using a central node to orchestrate this process, which is an inefficient, error-prone approach, Goenka wrote software to automatically assign dozens of data streams directly from the sequencer to dedicated nodes in the cloud. Meet the rest of this year's\u00a0Innovators Under 35. Then, to identify mutations, the sequences were aligned for comparison with a reference genome. She coded a custom program that triggers alignment as soon as base calling finishes for one batch of sequences while simultaneously initiating base calling for the next batch, thus ensuring that the system\u2019s computational resources are used efficiently.",
    "Add all these im\u00ad\u00adprove\u00ad\u00adments together, and Goenka\u2019s approach reduced the total time required to analyze a genome for mutations from around 20 hours to 1.5 hours. Finally, the team worked with genetic counselors and physicians to create a filter that identified which mutations were most critical to a person\u2019s health, and that set was then given a final manual curation by a genetic specialist. These final stages take up to three hours. The technology was close to being fully operational when, suddenly, the first patient arrived.\u00a0 A critical test When 13-year-old Matthew was flown to Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital in 2021, he was struggling to breathe and his heart was failing. Doctors needed to know whether the inflammation in his heart was due to a virus or to a genetic mutation that would necessitate a transplant.\u00a0\u00a0 His blood was drawn on a Thursday. The transplant committee made its decisions on Fridays. \u201cIt meant we had a small window of time,\u201d says Goenka. Goenka was in Mumbai when the sequencing began. She stayed up all night, monitoring the computations. That was when the project stopped being about getting faster for the sake of it, she says: \u201cIt became about \u2018How fast can we get this result to save this person\u2019s life?\u2019\u201d  The results revealed a genetic mutation that explained Matthew\u2019s condition, and he was placed on the transplant list the next day. Three weeks later, he received a new heart. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great now,\u201d Goenka says.

    "So far, Goenka\u2019s technology has been tested on 26 patients, including Matthew. Her pipeline is \u201cdirectly affecting the medical care of newborns in the Stanford intensive care units,\u201d Ashley says. Now she\u2019s aiming for even broader impact\u2014Goenka and her colleagues are laying the groundwork for a startup that they hope will bring the technology to market and make sure it reaches as many patients as possible. Meanwhile, she has been refining the computational pipeline, reducing the time to diagnosis to about six hours. The demand is clear, she says: \u201cIn an in-depth study involving more than a dozen laboratory directors and neonatologists, every respondent stressed urgency. One director put it succinctly: \u2018I need this platform today\u2014preferably yesterday.\u2019\u201d",
    "Goenka is also developing software to make the technology more inclusive. The reference genome is skewed toward people of European descent. The Human Pangenome Project is an international collaboration to create reference genomes from more diverse populations, which Goenka aims to use to personalize her team\u2019s filters, allowing them to flag mutations that may be more prevalent in the population to which a patient belongs. Since seeing her work, Goenka\u2019s extended family has become more appreciative of her education and career. \u201cThe entire family is very proud about the impact I\u2019ve made,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Helen Thomson is a freelance science journalist based in London. 2025Innovators Under 35Meet the InnovatorsInnovator of the Year: Sneha GoenkaFeatured Innovator: Yichao \"Peak\"JiFeatured Innovator: Iwnetim AbateIn their own words: How Trump's policies affect early-career scientistsOpinion: Why basic science deserves our boldest investmentHere\u2019s how we picked this year\u2019s Innovators Under 35Return to landing pagehide"
