    "After the big Covid-19 whipsaw, the most obvious forms of supply chain distress started to fade away. But the relative peace and quiet that executives are perceiving is actually ominous. Under the surface, supply chain risk has become severe, systemic, and strategic. Addressing the risk cannot be left to procurement and operations teams alone, however smart and skillful they are. Boards and CEOs need to put supply chains back at the top of their agendas. A leadership team that provides financial, operational, and organizational flexibility and understands that today\u2019s supply chains require new thinking \u2014 not just tinkering \u2014 can reduce the odds that they\u2019ll have to respond to crisis in this era of disruption.",
    "There may be no more dangerous phrase in business than \u201cthe new normal.\u201d It implies some kind of equilibrium, the notion that we can find and stay in a place where things are safe and balanced, where the earth won\u2019t suddenly shift beneath us and send our premises and plans tumbling down. That\u2019s what\u2019s people think is happening with supply chains \u2014 and it\u2019s a mistake.",
