    "By Kumudu Upul Shantha",
    "Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Rathnayake issued an order, yesterday (5), directing the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit a report to the Court regarding an alleged error made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Maddumabandara. This pertains to the inclusion of former MP Diana Gamage\u2019s name in the SJB\u2019s National List in 2020, despite her not holding citizenship in the country.",
    "Following a complaint lodged with the CID by a resident of Magampitiya (South), Dompe named Y.A. Saman Nishantha, the Court took action to address the matter.",
    "It has come to light that the General Secretary of the party erroneously included Diana Gamage\u2019s name, who lacks Sri Lankan citizenship, in the SJB National List.",
    "Officials from the CID informed the Court that the complainant had requested legal action to be taken against the responsible party.",
    "On reviewing the information presented by the CID officials, the Magistrate ordered a formal investigation into the incident and mandated that the findings be reported to the Court.",
    "The Supreme Court, on 8 May, held that State Minister Diana Gamage is disqualified to be an MP and is thus not entitled to hold office as an MP, as she was not a citizen of Sri Lanka.",
    "With this Supreme Court judgment, Gamage\u2019s disqualification led to the loss of her parliamentary seat.",
