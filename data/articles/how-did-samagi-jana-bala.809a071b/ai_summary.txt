Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Rathnayake has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to investigate the alleged error made by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Maddumabandara. The error pertains to the inclusion of former MP Diana Gamageâ€™s name on the SJB's National List in 2020, despite her not being a citizen of Sri Lanka. The directive came after a complaint from a resident, Y.A. Saman Nishantha. The Supreme Court ruled on 8 May that Gamage was disqualified from being an MP due to her lack of Sri Lankan citizenship, leading to her losing her parliamentary seat.
