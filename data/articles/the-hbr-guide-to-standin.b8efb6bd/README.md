Job interviews can be daunting. In this video, author Amy Gallo culls advice from top experts in the field and shares strategic tips on how best to prepare, what to do, and what to say so that you can make a great impression in your next interview. She also offers advice on what to do if you notice your interviewer losing interest or you’ve stumbled over some answers. Mistakes happen. Just keep going and stay focused. Answer the current question as if it’s the first one. Even acknowledging the situation with a corrective statement like, “Am I giving you what you need? Is there other information I could give you?” and then following their cues can help dig you out of the current hole and get the conversation back on track.
