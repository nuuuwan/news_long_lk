    "Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena is no more. It is hard to think of another who could rival his business acumen, intuition, courage and unwavering loyalty to his family and friends. His family will miss a devoted husband and father. The business empire he built and led will miss the titan who charted their extraordinary course for nearly 50 years. I will miss a dear, dear friend.",
    "I never had to reach out to Harry in turbulent times. He always knew, always came to my aid and stood by me unflinchingly, unbowed by the consequences of doing so. I will try to find solace in the fact that he lived well, held firmly to his principles and, was as gentle when tenderness was called for as he was tough when that was what it took to rise up against those who threatened that which he held dear.",
    "In the days to come I will relive each of the many precious moments I had the honour of sharing with Harry. We always called each other \u2018Lokka\u2019 or \u2018big guy\u2019, even though the sobriquet suited him far better than it did me. I will revisit his thoughtfulness and the many acts of kindness. I will struggle to come to terms with the fact that the one man who I could count on during the darkest times is no longer by my side. I will miss the phone call I received nearly every single day for several years. And I can never forget our last interaction, when he came to my home in his final hours, and I had the privilege of looking into his eyes, and firmly shaking his hand, one last time. Go well, Lokka. You will never, ever, be forgotten.",
