Many reports have shown that Americans are pessimistic about the economy — and their place in it — despite indicators that the labor market is robust and the economy is thriving. In order to explore why this pessimism persists, researchers at data and technnology...more

It’s been widely reported that U.S. consumers have been angry about the state of the U.S. economy. But why they’re so angry has been more of a puzzle. When we look at economic indicators for retail sales or consumer spending, we get a story about “the resilient American consumer.” But if consumers have shown resilience, what’s powering their anger? While part of the reason might be that so many consumers say they are worse off now compared to 2019, this sentiment raises questions because the strength of the labor market, the strength of the U.S. economy, and the resiliency of consumer spending all suggest the U.S. consumer is doing better today than before the pandemic.

For a more nuanced understanding of the U.S. consumer, we use a panel of 150,000 representative U.S. households to track what consumers say versus how they spend. We seek to understand why consumers have been unusually pessimistic about the U.S. economy and to what extent this pessimism has translated into changes in purchasing behavior.

Consumers are generally happy, but also tired, stressed, and frustrated — they’re not angry.

We asked a subset of our panelists (4,599 participants) how they feel: whether they are generally happy, stressed, angry, frustrated, or tired. Nearly 90% expressed at least one negative emotion. While a majority say they are happy, they also say they are stressed, frustrated, and tired. And the more negative the emotion, the worse consumers say they are doing in today’s economy relative to 2019. But the one emotion that stands out is “angry.” The majority of consumers we polled said they are not angry, which means the characterization of a resilient but angry consumer is false. Most consumers say they are happy, but stressed, frustrated, and tired.

Being Resilient Takes Effort

Economists have consistently been surprised by the resiliency of the American consumer despite high inflation and high interest rates. But being resilient takes effort. We can think of this effort in two dimensions: the first is the effort required to earn more income and the second is the effort required to spend less or cut back on consumption.

The effort required to earn more income

Our data found that many U.S. consumers switched to higher paying jobs, took on additional jobs, or took on additional hours of work. Roughly half of our survey panelists reported they did at least one of these since 2019. Those who switched to higher paying jobs said they were more likely to be doing the same or better now than in 2019. Those who said they took on additional jobs or additional hours were more likely to say they were doing worse. And those who took on additional jobs or hours were also more likely to say they were stressed or tired.

While economists have championed the strength of the labor market, near record levels of prime-age labor force participation, and all-time highs in female prime-age labor force participation, this strength comes at a cost, and that cost is that U.S. consumers are more stressed, frustrated, and tired.

The effort required to spend less

The second dimension of effort is trying to spend less. We ask consumers if they are now:

Clipping coupons or buying items on promotion;

Shopping at lower priced retailers, shopping more often at multiple retailers, or doing more research to see where items are less expensive;

Buying in bulk or buying more private-label brands to save money.

Most consumers say they are now doing at least one of these activities more often to save money, and the more consumers say they are doing these activities, the more likely they are to say they are doing worse versus 2019.

Spending on everyday consumer purchases has held up across the board

Now here’s the catch: we see that even consumers who say they are worse off now are buying the same or more than they were in 2019. To be clear, consumers are not just spending more — we adjust for inflation — they are actually consuming more overall. Our data includes purchases of everyday consumer items — things people buy at retailers like Walmart, Costco, grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, hardware stores, sporting goods stores, fast food chains — but it excludes services like going to concerts and movies, sending children to daycare, traveling on airplanes, staying in hotels, and it excludes housing and vehicle purchases.

For everyday purchases, we see people are consuming the same or more now than they were in 2019. By this objective measure of how much people are consuming in real terms — which is how economists tend to measure well-being — consumers should be the same or better-off than they were in 2019, but they are saying the opposite. And one reason is because people say they are putting in more effort to consume about the same or more as they were doing before.

Why Consumers Are Pessimistic

We offer two theories for why consumer sentiment has been in the doldrums and why consumers are putting in more effort to buy the same or more as they did before.

The first is that consumers are not just making comparisons to their prior selves, they are also comparing themselves to others. They might be absolutely better-off compared to their prior selves, but are they relatively better-off compared to others?

And the second is that once you give someone something good, they will be especially frustrated when you take it away. This is the Nobel prize-winning notion of the “endowment effect,” and we just experienced it coming out of the pandemic, with the giving and then the taking away of unprecedented government support.

Even low-income consumers are consuming more on average than they were prior to the pandemic. But the gap between high and low-income households has widened. If low-income households compare their current and pre-pandemic levels of everyday purchases, after adjusting for inflation, they are doing better. But if they are comparing themselves to higher-income households, they feel left behind.

The endowment effect: once you giveth, you cannot taketh away

Consumers were able to afford much more than they normally consumed in 2021, when the Biden Administration issued the last round of government support payments and before inflation took hold. After that, affordability eroded, and by June 2022, at the height of consumer price inflation and before wages could catch up, affordability was below pre-pandemic levels. This point, in June 2022, coincides with the nadir in consumer sentiment. More recently, wage increases and income growth have outpaced inflation, including for lower-income households. While affordability and sentiment have recovered since June 2022 and affordability is now above pre-pandemic levels, the memory of the good times in 2021 is still with us: the moment when vaccines became widely available, entertainment venues were opening back up, travel was picking up, restaurants and bars were fully reopen, and consumers were flush with pandemic savings. The aggregate economy is better today than it was in 2021, despite higher price levels, but we’re past the wave of euphoric consumption that occurred with the full reopening of the economy.

What have consumers cut back on?

In our data, we see consumers are buying the same or more of their everyday purchases as they did in 2019. So what they have cut back on is not everyday purchases like groceries, personal care products, and fast food.

When we ask consumers what they are cutting back on, they are more likely to say it is indulgences rather than necessities, and the worse they say they are doing, the more they are cutting back on things like travel, eating out, and entertainment. We are consuming a little more than we were before the pandemic, but we also had a period in 2021 of being able to afford indulgences once we came out of the pandemic. And we are still seeing that higher-income consumers are not pulling back. Those who say they are doing better now have had more extreme gains in consumption. They are continuing to spend and leaving lower-income consumers behind.

Other Explanations for Consumer Pessimism

We explore some alternative explanations for consumer pessimism, looking at the role of politics, where consumers get their information, and household financial conditions.

Is it all just politics?

First, it is not just our political environment, although our political environment does play a role. When we asked consumers before and after the election how they felt about their current economic conditions, sentiment barely changed. What changed was how people felt about the future: whether they were more hopeful or optimistic. Counties where Trump won in 2020 by a larger margin became much more optimistic now about the future while counties where Biden won in 2020 by a larger margin became somewhat more pessimistic. Even though sentiment about future conditions changed, sentiment about current conditions did not, which makes sense since current economic conditions hardly changed in the few weeks right before and after the election.

The rise in optimism for future economic conditions in areas where Trump won by a larger margin now presents a challenge for the new administration. Expectations are high. But campaign promises like lowering prices are going to be difficult (if not impossible) to achieve; deflation only tends to happen during severe economic downturns. Price levels are also visible and easy for consumers to monitor: consumers know when the everyday items they purchase are getting more expensive. Consumers’ views about the future may be politically influenced, but their views on the present have more grounding in their own experiences and in the information they receive about the experiences of others.

It matters where consumers get their information

Second, we looked at where consumers get their information and how they feel depending on where they get their information. We see that consumers who rely more heavily on certain media sources tend to be more pessimistic about current conditions while consumers who rely less on these media sources have been more optimistic. Information plays a role in how consumers view their economic environment, which means disinformation can skew consumers’ perceptions of economic reality. Unless it is the case that those who get their information from different media sources truly have very different economic experiences, then the differences in sentiment depending on how consumers get information is just “vibes.” We check for this by looking at whether increases in spending on everyday items differs meaningfully depending on where consumers get their information; it does not. This leads us to conclude that differences in sentiment associated with differences in media consumption are just “vibes” and do not reflect underlying economic realities.

Household financial conditions

Third, household financial conditions tend to be okay. When consumers are asked about their own financial conditions, they tend to say they are doing fine. This question about financial conditions is more specific than the questions Numerator asks in its surveys, which is about “how are you and your household doing in today’s economy” and how consumers are feeling. In Numerator’s surveys, consumers say they are not doing as well as they were in 2019 despite their own financial conditions being okay.

While credit card debt has gone up, what matters is credit card debt relative to income, and that is still below pre-pandemic levels. Delinquencies overall are down compared to 2019, and delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, given the high interest rate environment, are modestly higher than in 2019 but still historically low. Overall, we cannot point to a deterioration in household financial conditions as a reason for the “vibecession.” Household financial conditions tend to be okay, although as we saw, households are working harder to maintain these financial conditions and financial conditions are admittedly worse now than they were in 2021, when the economy fully re-opened and households began to spend down their pandemic-era savings.

Are we better off today than we were in 2019?

Margaret Thatcher in 1990 responded to one of her critics: “All levels of income are better-off today… You would rather the poor were poorer provided the rich were less rich…” This seems to be what we’re experiencing today: all levels of income are objectively better-off in 2024 and going into 2025, in terms of the everyday items they are consuming, than they were in 2019, but because the gap has grown between low and high-income households, because people are putting in more effort to keep up, and because people experienced a period of euphoric consumption coming out of the pandemic that they are no longer experiencing today, they are saying they are collectively stressed, frustrated, and tired. Expectations are now high for change, but it is unclear whether consumers will get a reprieve from the conditions that made them stressed, frustrated, and tired to begin with.
