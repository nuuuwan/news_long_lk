Maintaining clear boundaries in a mentorship relationship is critical for protecting privacy, mental health, and productivity. Such boundaries should ideally be discussed and established at the beginning of the relationship. This may involve inquiring about the mentor's own boundaries before discussing personal limits. The concept of boundaries extends to areas such as discussions about personal lives and professional advice. To ensure a productive and respectful mentorship, it's important for both parties to clearly communicate and respect the established boundaries.
