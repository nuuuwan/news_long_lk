    "In a mentorship, having\u00a0clear boundaries \u2014 along with responses to share when those limits are transgressed \u2014 is important for safeguarding your mental health, your privacy, and your productivity. To establish them, have a conversation with your mentor, preferably at the start of the relationship. You can start by flipping the script and asking your mentor about their boundaries first: \u201cSince this is all new, though, I wanted to ask: What boundaries do you want to have around our mentoring relationship?\u201d Listen to their answers, taking the opportunity to weigh in about your own boundaries as they share. If your mentor says, \u201cI really like to keep the details about my personal life out of work,\u201d you can weigh in, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s good to know. I\u2019m an open book, so I don\u2019t mind sharing if you have questions.\u201d",
    "At a recent networking event, I was introduced to a young professional in her first five years in the workforce. (Let\u2019s call her Anne.) She was in the process of assembling\u00a0 a board of mentors, and expressed concern about one individual who seemed to take offense when Anne didn\u2019t act on their advice immediately or at all. More concerning to her was this mentor\u2019s tendency to veer into personal topics, such as Anne\u2019s future family planning \u2014 an area she hadn\u2019t yet decided on and felt irrelevant to her current goal of securing a sales position at a large tech company. Anne liked this mentor but was uncomfortable with the focus on her personal life and unsure of how to address it.",
