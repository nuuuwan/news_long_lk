# The Importance of Setting Boundaries with Your Mentor

## Summary ü§ñ

Maintaining clear boundaries in a mentorship relationship is critical for protecting privacy, mental health, and productivity. Such boundaries should ideally be discussed and established at the beginning of the relationship. This may involve inquiring about the mentor's own boundaries before discussing personal limits. The concept of boundaries extends to areas such as discussions about personal lives and professional advice. To ensure a productive and respectful mentorship, it's important for both parties to clearly communicate and respect the established boundaries.

In a mentorship, having¬†clear boundaries ‚Äî along with responses to share when those limits are transgressed ‚Äî is important for safeguarding your mental health, your privacy, and your productivity. To establish them, have a conversation with your mentor, preferably at the start of the relationship. You can start by flipping the script and asking your mentor about their boundaries first: ‚ÄúSince this is all new, though, I wanted to ask: What boundaries do you want to have around our mentoring relationship?‚Äù Listen to their answers, taking the opportunity to weigh in about your own boundaries as they share. If your mentor says, ‚ÄúI really like to keep the details about my personal life out of work,‚Äù you can weigh in, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôm an open book, so I don‚Äôt mind sharing if you have questions.‚Äù

At a recent networking event, I was introduced to a young professional in her first five years in the workforce. (Let‚Äôs call her Anne.) She was in the process of assembling¬† a board of mentors, and expressed concern about one individual who seemed to take offense when Anne didn‚Äôt act on their advice immediately or at all. More concerning to her was this mentor‚Äôs tendency to veer into personal topics, such as Anne‚Äôs future family planning ‚Äî an area she hadn‚Äôt yet decided on and felt irrelevant to her current goal of securing a sales position at a large tech company. Anne liked this mentor but was uncomfortable with the focus on her personal life and unsure of how to address it.
