    "Tourism doesn\u2019t sell itself. It needs to be championed\u2014by someone who understands how the global travel trade works",
    "This isn\u2019t a political critique. It\u2019s a practical observation\u2014one I make as someone who has worked in tourism for decades and has watched Governments come and go, each trying to steer the country through different storms.",
    "Right now, Sri Lanka has one individual serving as both Foreign Minister and Tourism Minister. On paper, this might seem efficient\u2014one capable person across two important portfolios. But the question I keep coming back to is: can one person realistically give both roles the attention and strategic leadership they require?",
    "Foreign Affairs and Tourism are not side portfolios. In our current context, they are two of the most vital pillars of national recovery. Each is complex. Each is demanding. And each deserves undivided ministerial focus.",
    "The Foreign Ministry: More than just managing protocol",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Ministry is more than a protocol department. In today\u2019s context, it is one of the most pivotal arms of government\u2014and it needs to function with clarity, intent, and professionalism.",
    "We remain under formal scrutiny at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), following multiple resolutions calling for credible investigations into alleged wartime human rights violations. The UN\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is actively collecting and preserving evidence, citing a lack of sufficient domestic accountability.",
    "In March 2025, the United Kingdom imposed travel bans and asset freezes on four Sri Lankans, including three former senior military commanders, over their alleged roles in war-related abuses. These developments carry weight. They shape international perceptions and influence how governments, donors, and multilateral institutions choose to engage with us.",
    "On top of that, Sri Lanka sits in a highly sensitive geopolitical zone, at the intersection of Indian, Chinese, and American strategic interests. We\u2019ve long positioned ourselves as non-aligned, but maintaining that balance requires ongoing diplomatic effort and credible representation abroad.",
    "Foreign affairs today isn\u2019t only about defending our image. It\u2019s about creating opportunity. The Government has made it clear that foreign investment, exports, and tourism are priorities. A skilled, commercially minded foreign ministry can contribute to all three\u2014by",
    "engaging investors, supporting exporters, and promoting Sri Lanka as a destination and economic partner.",
    "But for this to work, the system must be capable. Over the past two decades, the foreign service has become increasingly politicised. Too many senior appointments have gone to political allies rather than professionals. The result has been a decline in continuity, expertise, and credibility. If we want results, we need to rebuild professionalism and place competence at the centre of appointments.",
    "This isn\u2019t something that can be managed on the side. It requires full-time leadership. Which leads to the next question: Can one person realistically handle this portfolio\u2014and also lead the Ministry of Tourism?",
    "I fully recognise that the current Government, under the NPP, has committed to a lean Cabinet of 21 ministers as part of its drive for fiscal discipline. That principle deserves credit. But given the complexity and national importance of the Foreign Affairs and Tourism portfolios, I believe this is one area where making room for an additional portfolio would be both justified and beneficial.",
    "The Tourism Ministry: Harnessing unprecedented growth",
    "Tourism is not just a feel-good sector for Sri Lanka\u2014it\u2019s potentially an economic powerhouse with one of the highest multiplier effects in the economy. It creates jobs across the spectrum, supports small businesses, generates foreign exchange, and helps rural communities thrive.",
    "And it\u2019s not just us saying that. The current Government has rightly identified tourism as a national priority\u2014both for economic recovery and for long-term growth.",
    "In fact, from January 2025 to date, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest monthly tourism arrivals in its history\u2014surpassing even the pre-COVID peak of 2018. The rebound is real. The potential is enormous.",
    "But growth without strategy is unsustainable.",
    "As at the time of writing, Sri Lanka still does not have a cohesive international marketing campaign in place. There\u2019s no consistent messaging, no universally recognised tourism brand, and no strong promotional visibility in key markets.",
    "Tourism doesn\u2019t sell itself. It needs to be championed\u2014by someone who understands how the global travel trade works, what investors and operators need, and how to build a product that is saleable, accessible, and desirable.",
    "Take the Pekoe Trail, for instance\u2014a world-class hiking route that had been sitting there all along but was only recently developed into a compelling tourism product. We need more of this. Look at the Camino de Santiago in Spain\u2014once a religious pilgrimage route, now a world-renowned trail drawing hundreds of thousands each year.",
    "Product matters. And developing it takes vision, strategy, and collaboration.",
    "A strong tourism minister needs to think like a commercial leader\u2014engaging airlines, resolving visa bottlenecks, speaking the language of the industry, and building credibility with the global travel trade. That\u2019s not a ceremonial role. It\u2019s operational, strategic, and relentless.",
    "A minister who understood the assignment",
    "Some years ago, back in the day when I was attending ITB Berlin\u2014the world\u2019s biggest travel trade fair\u2014I met the then Tourism Minister of the Maldives. We exchanged cards, and I noticed the back of his card had a striking aerial photo of the Maldivian atolls. \u201cThat\u2019s my product,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m selling.\u201d",
    "I asked him what he typically did at ITB. He told me his team arranged direct meetings with the CEOs of the top European tour operators. And in those meetings, after the small talk, he would ask: \u201cWhat can I do, as Minister of Tourism of the Maldives, to help you bring more tourists to my country?\u201d",
    "That moment has stayed with me.",
    "What impressed me was that the Maldivian government clearly understood the value of tourism to their economy\u2014and had placed one of their best and brightest in the role. The minister treated his job as one of sales, strategy, and service. He understood that he was the chief sales officer of his country. I\u2019ve seen similar approaches in countries like Egypt, where the tourism minister behaves more like a business leader than a bureaucrat.",
    "We don\u2019t need to copy other countries. But we can take inspiration from what works.",
    "So\u2014can one person realistically do both?",
    "It\u2019s a fair question. And it\u2019s not a comment on any individual\u2019s capability. It\u2019s a matter of bandwidth, structure, and where we as a country choose to place our priorities.",
    "You can\u2019t be defending your country at the UN in Geneva and promoting it at a travel trade show in Berlin at the same time. These are demanding jobs, in vastly different worlds.",
    "If we\u2019re serious about foreign policy, serious about tourism, and serious about recovery, then we need to structure our Government accordingly.",
    "We have the talent. What we need now is the clarity of purpose\u2014and the leadership architecture\u2014to let that talent thrive.",
