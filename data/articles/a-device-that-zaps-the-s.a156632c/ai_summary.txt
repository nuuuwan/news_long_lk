Journalist Melanie Reid, paralysed after falling from a horse, has regained some use of her left hand following treatment with a new non-invasive stimulation device, the ARCex. The device delivers electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, which in a four-month clinical trial of 60 patients resulted in 72% seeing improvement in both strength and function of their hands or arms after the device was switched off. Ninety percent saw improvements in at least one of those areas and 87% reported an improvement in their quality of life. This means the device can now be submitted for regulatory approval. The ARCex was developed by Onward Medical and is best suited for people who retain some ability to move below the site of their injury. Onward Medical is also developing implantable devices.
