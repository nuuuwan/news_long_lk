    "The NPP now resembles an immune system attacking its own organs",
    "From rebellion to ritual, the NPP now reverberates within its own sanctified walls. This essay investigates how moral certainty, tribal loyalty, and choreographed performance have displaced scrutiny \u2014 transforming a once reformist movement into a closed temple of affirmation, where questions perish and only echoes remain. Drawing on Jonathan Haidt\u2019s moral psychology, it explores how the architecture of belief within the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has become a fortress of cognitive closure, where loyalty is virtue and dissent is sacrilege.",
    "1.Introduction: From moral binding to echo chambers",
    "In the first part of this essay, I explored Jonathan Haidt\u2019s challenge to the Enlightenment belief in human rationality. Moral decisions, he argues, are driven less by reasoned deliberation than by fast, intuitive, and emotionally charged responses. His metaphor of the mind as a rider on an elephant \u2014 where reason merely justifies choices already made by instinct \u2014 reveals the psychological foundations of political tribalism. This lens helps explain the unwavering loyalty of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) base, which is shaped less by policy than by a shared sense of moral virtue and redemptive identity. In the (NPP), loyalty has become a liturgy, and reason a postscript. In such a matrix, critics become apostates, and dissent is framed as betrayal. We now turn to how this moral logic constructs echo chambers that insulate power and silence doubt.",
    "2.The moral echo chamber: Binding, blinding and the architecture of belief",
    "One of the most revealing features of the NPP\u2019s rise is its success in constructing a sealed moral soundscape \u2014 a space where dissent is not simply rejected, but rendered inaudible. This is nowhere more evident than in the NPP\u2019s meticulously staged rallies. These events are not civic deliberations but moral performances, carefully choreographed to bind believers and sanctify leadership. The physical and emotional architecture of these gatherings resembles what Jonathan Haidt describes as a \u201cmoral community\u201d: a closed system where virtue is defined internally and doubt is expelled like a virus1.",
    "Each rally begins not with policy discussion but with ritual. The anthem-like \u201cAda mulu rata, eka mitakata, suba nakathata, rata Anurata\u201d frames Anura Kumara Disanayake (AKD) as the nation\u2019s moral centre. The voice of Nanda Malini \u2014 a revered cultural icon \u2014 baptises the event in nostalgic legitimacy. From above, media images often show curved, amphitheatre-like formations, orienting all attention to the stage. Chants of \u201cMalimawata Jayawewa!\u201d fill the air \u2014 not questions, but invocations. There are no audience microphones, no open-floor dialogue. Unlimited, undeliverable promises prevail. Criticism is not debated; it is drowned.",
    "Haidt\u2019s framework helps decode this environment. In moral communities, intuition leads and reasoning follows. But in NPP rallies, reasoning is not only subordinate \u2014 it is disqualified. The event becomes not only an echo chamber in sound but in cognition: a closed loop of emotional conviction, immune to contradiction.",
    "The NPP has activated a narrow set of potent moral triggers: fairness (framed as equality), loyalty (to the party), and sanctity (of ideological purity). These are woven into a cocoon of righteousness \u2014 shielding the faithful from critique, self-doubt or dissonance. In this echoic enclosure, decisions are not assessed by consequence, but by fidelity to the tribe\u2019s moral script. Even suppression of protest or media control is reframed as virtuous if done in service of the cause.",
    "The 2025 Local Government elections provide a clear example. As reported in The Island, the Government threatened to withhold funds from councils not controlled by the NPP2 \u2014 a tactic once condemned when used by rivals. Yet within the echo chamber, this coercion is not betrayal but \u201cpublic protection.\u201d As Haidt notes, moral reasoning often functions like a \u201cpress secretary\u201d \u2014 rationalising decisions already made.",
    "Critics within the movement \u2014 especially from the left \u2014 face swift condemnation. They are not debated but demonised as traitors or infiltrators. The former ethos of internal self-critique has withered. Disagreement is no longer framed as democratic discourse, but as ideological heresy.",
    "What emerges is not a pluralistic movement, but a moralised political order \u2014 one that resembles a sanctified sect more than a democratic front. The very moral structures that once fuelled reform have hardened into a fortress. Scrutiny is kept out. Dogma is locked in.",
    "3.The Echo Temple: A metaphor for moral seclusion",
    "To understand the NPP\u2019s current behaviour, consider a metaphor: the Echo Temple. Imagine a temple high in the hills \u2014 not for worship, but for moral resonance. Its curved walls are designed to reflect only the voices of those within. Devotees gather daily, reciting the slogans and hopes of their political movement. Every idea \u2014 no matter how implausible or contradictory \u2014 is met with nods and repetition. When someone says, \u201cThis promise is unworkable,\u201d or \u201cThis leader once said the opposite,\u201d the sound dies before it reaches the ears of the faithful.",
    "Now picture an outsider climbing the hill to speak. His words echo inside \u2014 but distorted, even threatening. He is not one of them. His message is not evaluated on merit, but rejected for its origin.",
    "Inside this structure, binding and blinding become architectural. The temple binds followers with shared identity \u2014 but also blinds them, filtering out dissent and transforming criticism into enemy noise.",
    "In the case of the NPP, the metaphor captures a movement marked by unity without introspection, energy without correction. Inside the Echo Temple, affirmation becomes truth and dissent becomes treason. What emerges is not democratic discourse, but tribal psychology \u2014 where loyalty overrides logic and moral purity becomes the price of inclusion.",
    "The NPP has activated a narrow set of potent moral triggers: fairness (framed as equality), loyalty (to the party), and sanctity (of ideological purity). These are woven into a cocoon of righteousness \u2014 shielding the faithful from critique, self-doubt or dissonance. In this echoic enclosure, decisions are not assessed by consequence, but by fidelity to the tribe\u2019s moral script. Even suppression of protest or media control is reframed as virtuous if done in service of the cause",
    "4.Metaphors of sealed systems: Immunity, inertia and ideological closure",
    "In a previous article, I applied biological and Newtonian metaphors to the NPP\u2019s evolution3. These remain vital as the party\u2019s internal culture continues to mutate into a sealed ideological system.",
    "The NPP now resembles an immune system attacking its own organs. Constructive scepticism is treated as infection; facts that disrupt the party\u2019s moral narrative are not examined but expelled. Its rhetorical antibodies \u2014 moral posturing, selective outrage, ridicule \u2014 fail to distinguish good-faith critique from sabotage. In this autoimmune reflex, ideological purity trumps intellectual honesty.",
    "From Newtonian physics, the NPP behaves like a body in motion governed by inertia: propelled by moral conviction, it continues unchecked unless disrupted by an external force. Yet in a closed ideological system, such a force is not permitted. The party\u2019s internal gravity traps its adherents in circular orbit \u2014 motion mistaken for progress, mass mistaken for wisdom.",
    "While this unity inspires loyalty, it breeds moral arrogance. When a movement loses its ability to self-correct, it risks transforming from a vehicle of change into a temple of echo.",
    "The NPP\u2019s moral engine no longer drives reform \u2014 it recites doctrine. Inside the Echo Temple, truth is what the faithful chant, and doubt is heresy. Without rupture or reflection, the movement risks becoming what it once opposed: a sanctified machine, deaf to decay and blind to its own beginnings.",
