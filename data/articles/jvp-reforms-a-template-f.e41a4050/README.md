Disgruntled political leaders, who have been Pied Piping the blind followers and politically illiterate masses to oblivion for decades...

The JVP’s leadership, which initially celebrated figures like Marx, Engels, Trotsky, and their own founder Wijeweera by prominently displaying their portraits during May Day marches, eventually chose to abandon these symbols

If the JVP, historically linked to radical movements, can embrace change and move toward, then the rest of the political leadership in Sri Lanka must follow

Time waits for no one. Washington Irving’s Rip Van Winkle, the Dutch-American villager, fell into a deep sleep and awoke 20 years later to find a transformed world. During his slumber, he missed the American Revolution, which shaped the colonies into a nation rooted in liberty and self-governance. By the time Rip awoke, the ideals of equality and justice had become a rallying cry for change.

We blend literary and historical metaphors to emphasise the transformative urgency required for political relevance. The NPP’s proactive reforms stand as a wake-up call to the SJB and beyond!

This seismic shift we experienced with recent elections signals a profound transformation in the island’s political landscape, underscoring the electorate’s rejection of traditional power blocs in favour of new, dynamic forces that promise meaningful change.

Before the end of the war, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) held a strong position in the North and East, securing 22 seats in the 2004 Parliamentary Elections. However, by 2010, just a year after the war ended, the TNA’s parliamentary representation dwindled to 14 seats. In the 2015 elections, it regained some ground, increasing its seats to 16, but this momentum proved short-lived as the 2020 elections saw the number drop again to just 10, followed by 8 in 2024. This steady decline was accompanied by growing rifts within the coalition. Differences among the constituent parties of the TNA began to surface during this period, undermining the alliance’s cohesion and effectiveness. These internal divisions, combined with shifting voter priorities and dissatisfaction with the TNA’s performance, further eroded its influence as the primary political force representing the Tamil community.

They all marched solemnly to the poignant tune of the Last Post played on the bugle,an apt metaphor for the demise of once-formidable political entities. In the North and East, the Federal Party (FP) and Tamil Congress (TC), long-standing voices of Tamil aspirations, joined their Southern counterparts, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), along with its off-shoot, SLPP all fading into political obscurity. Burdened by ineffective leadership, the SJB risks slipping into irrelevance on the political stage. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), once the main political force representing Tamils in Parliament, has now become the latest casualty in this decline.

Reading Martin Wickramasinghe

The world will continue to evolve, progress, and transform, whether one is prepared for it or not. Change is an inevitable force that spares no one.

The late Sinhala intellectual novelist cum social critique, Martin Wickremasinghe fictionalised the essence of this concept through his masterpiece,Gamperaliya (The Transformation of a Village), portraying the profound shifts in Sri Lankan rural life.  When the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike secured a resounding victory in the 1956 General Election, he described this event in the Bamunukulaye Binda Weteema (collapse of the comprador bourgeoisie).  Both these work were deeply rooted in the theory of evolution, the first, applying its principles to societal, cultural structures and the latter to political transformations.

The ‘old left’ of the LSSP and CP failed to evolve, steadfastly adhering to outdated Marxist ideologies that no longer resonated with the changing political and social setting. This rigid commitment to obsolete doctrines ultimately led to their gradual decline and loss of applicability in Sri Lanka’s political sphere. Similarly, the JVP’s leadership, which initially celebrated figures like Marx, Engels, Trotsky, and their own founder Wijeweera by prominently displaying their portraits during May Day marches, eventually chose to abandon these symbols. This shift highlights the recognition that clinging to such relics of the past can alienate contemporary audiences and hinder progress. The JVP’s failed leader, Somawansa Amarasinghe, who opposed change, was tactfully encouraged to step aside, clearing the path for dynamism and progress.

The evolution of political thought and strategy is no longer an option but a necessity to stay connected with the aspirations and needs of the people. This lesson serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of embracing transformation with foresight, resilience, and adaptability.

It cast aside its old identity and the baggage that came with it, notably shedding the past image of a movement associated with violent uprisings and radicalism. In a bold move to reposition itself, the JVP engaged a more professional and intellectual class of members, signaling a shift toward a more mature and responsible political identity. This evolution culminated in the creation of a new political platform, the NPP (National People’s Power), which was not just a rebranding, but a complete overhaul of its ideological stance and tactics.

If the JVP, historically linked to radical movements and violence, can embrace change and move toward a more professional, values-driven future, then the rest of the political leadership in Sri Lanka must follow suit. For political parties to remain relevant in the 21st century, they must cast off outdated ideologies and engage with the emerging professional and intellectual class, focusing on solutions that address the real needs of the people. Adopting the spirit of renewal, much like the NPP’s shift toward “Malimava,” is essential for any party seeking to rebuild trust, promote progressive ideas, and chart a better course for the country’s future.

This reinvention presents a clear message to other disgruntled political leaders, who have been Pied Piping the blind followers and politically illiterate masses to oblivion for decades, like the 13th century Pied Piper of Hamelin who promised to rid the city of a rat infestation for 1,000 guilders, and lured the rats into the Weser River, where they drowned, and then lured 130 children away, leading them into a cave after being refused the promised pay.[The same fate may await politicians who make grand promises, offering the Sun and Moon, only to come up with weak excuses to avoid fulfilling them once in power.

Change Leaders and Policies

The rank and file, the grassroots of traditional political groups battered, shattered, and ultimately rejected, must prioritise restructuring their organisations with fresh leadership to meet future demands. Rather than idly waiting for the premature collapse of the NPP government, (like the proverbial jackal trailing behind the goat), they should seise this moment to critically evaluate their weaknesses and implement meaningful reforms.

NPP Accepts Ranil’s IMF Deal?

It is commendable that the NPP government has set aside its own economic ‘blueprint’ and diligently implemented the existing program, ensuring stability and success. Despite the NPP’s campaign rhetoric, the President, in his inaugural speech, underscored the importance of adhering to economic recovery policies already in place.

The government’s decision to import rice is a flawed surrender to the millers’ Mafia, as it will lead to hoarding, lower local paddy prices, and fail to address the root issue. The solution is to stop imports, avoid wasting dollars, and take firm action against millers without yielding to their influence, unlike previous administrations. People long for change!
