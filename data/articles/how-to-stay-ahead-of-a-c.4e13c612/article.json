    "Cybercriminals are growing more sophisticated in attacking organizations, operations, and data. Increasingly sophisticated and frequent attacks result in greater success, with more significant financial impact to businesses. In 2023, the average recovery time from a successful attack was three weeks, with revenue loss averaging $365,000 per hour of downtime.",
    "Even organizations that have business continuity and disaster recovery plans for their critical data, systems, and functionalities may be missing the infrastructure and tools they need to recover from an attack. Using an isolated, secure digital environment can close that gap, speeding time to recovery and reducing financial impact.",
