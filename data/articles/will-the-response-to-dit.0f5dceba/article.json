    "Sri Lanka\u2019s progress has repeatedly been hindered by decisions that neglect the \u201cunseen,\u201d a tendency evident in nearly all Government policy, but particularly urgent today is the response to Ditwah as well as monetary policy",
    "In the aftermath of Ditwah, shortages of food, water, and basic necessities have emerged. Retailers, facing constrained supply and higher risks, have raised prices. The Commissioner General of Essential Services has declared such increases as \u201cimmoral and illegal,\u201d vowing legal action. This policy ignores critical \u201cunseen\u201d market mechanisms. Higher prices in scarcity perform vital functions. They ration limited goods",
    "The Parable of the Broken Window",
    "In 1850, the French economist Frederic Bastiat penned \u201cThe Parable of the Broken Window.\u201d A boy breaks a shop window, and a glazier is paid six francs to repair it. Onlookers muse that such accidents are good for trade, as they keep windowmakers in business. This logic, Bastiat argues, focuses only on the \u201cseen\u201d consequence\u2014the glazier\u2019s gain\u2014while ignoring the \u201cunseen.\u201d",
    "The shopkeeper, now six francs poorer, cannot spend that money on a new hat, shoes, or a book. The \u201cunseen\u201d consequence is the business denied to the tailor, the cobbler, and the bookseller. In a better world, the shopkeeper would have both his window and a new good. Bastiat\u2019s lesson is that sound policy must also account for \u201cunseen\u201d effects.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s progress has repeatedly been hindered by decisions that neglect the \u201cunseen,\u201d a tendency evident in nearly all Government policy, but particularly urgent today is the response to Ditwah as well as monetary policy.",
    "The fallacy of price controls in a disaster",
    "In the aftermath of Ditwah, shortages of food, water, and basic necessities have emerged. Retailers, facing constrained supply and higher risks, have raised prices. The Commissioner General of Essential Services has declared such increases as \u201cimmoral and illegal,\u201d vowing legal action. This policy ignores critical \u201cunseen\u201d market mechanisms.",
    "Higher prices in scarcity perform vital functions. They ration limited goods, ensuring, for example, water is used for the sick rather than watering gardens, and prevent wasteful hoarding. Furthermore, elevated profits incentivise entrepreneurs to take significant risks\u2014navigating flood-damaged infrastructure\u2014to deliver essential goods. This increased supply and competition would, over time, drive prices back down, fostering a robust recovery.",
    "We see this model working in the private sector: In the telecommunications space we observe that internet data consumption is controlled through careful time or usage based pricing. General purpose data is expensive. However, data specifically for social media (including WhatsApp), and entertainment media can be obtained through data packages, which offer better value. Furthermore data is lower priced or unlimited at off-peak hours. This nuanced pricing prevents shortages of internet data, which has become akin to a critical good.",
    "Similarly the private transport space has also shown abundance and resilience in times of crisis through flexible pricing allowing driver bidding, and making excellent use of technology.",
    "By targeting businesses for raising prices, the Government prevents these natural corrective mechanisms. The \u201cseen\u201d effect is the suppression of a price spike; the \u201cunseen\u201d consequence is prolonged shortage, misallocation of resources, and a disincentive for the private sector to shoulder recovery.",
    "While politically challenging, the Government must consider empowering the market\u2019s knowledge system rather than attempting to override it. Controlling an economy\u2019s vast array of prices, goods, and services is an informationally impossible task for any central authority, as evidenced by economic history worldwide and the experience of developed nations",
    "The Central Bank and the inflation tax",
    "Economic turmoil followed the COVID pandemic, marked by a plummeting rupee and soaring cost of living. With Ditwah a similar outcome can be expected if the same policies that led to that outcome are followed.",
    "Due to the promised public reliefs the Government spending must increase. However, it will have difficulty financing this increase with tax takings. To solve this problem it is likely to rely on the central bank, as it has done in the past.",
    "The post-COVID economic turmoil was due to the inflationary actions of the central bank. Seduced by political expediency, the bank printed money to bridge the gap between diminished tax takings and elevated spending. Classical economics holds that inflation is the expansion of money supply; price rises are merely a symptom.",
    "This printed money diluted purchasing power without an explicit levy. Printing money is an \u201cinvisible tax\u201d, and its wider impacts are corrosive and often unseen. It facilitates the Cantillon Effect: those closest to new money (contractors, financial institutions) spend it first at full value, while the general public bears the cost through higher prices, effectively transferring wealth from the poor to the rich.",
    "Moreover, as Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek described, it cheapens credit, creating a \u201cbusiness cycle\u201d of artificial booms and malinvestment, followed by inevitable busts when real resources prove scarce. This causes the economy to continuously weaken over time.",
    "This steady weakening has been observed since the central bank\u2019s creation in 1950, prior to which the rupee was pegged to the Sterling Pound and could not be inflated.",
    "As J\u00f6rg Guido H\u00fclsmann explains in \u201cThe Ethics of Money Production\u201d, inflation encourages debt, punishes savers, weakens family ties as people seek work abroad, hyper-centralises state power and encourages war. All of these symptoms have been observed in Sri Lanka\u2019s post independence history.",
    "As a cherry on top, the completion of the Lotus Tower just prior to economic collapse eerily mirrors the \u201cSkyscraper Index\u201d phenomenon, a hallmark of an inflationary bubble caused by central banks.",
    "Economic turmoil followed the COVID pandemic, marked by a plummeting rupee and soaring cost of living. With Ditwah a similar outcome can be expected if the same policies that led to that outcome are followed",
    "Due to the promised public reliefs the Government spending must increase. However, it will have difficulty financing this increase with tax takings. To solve this problem it is likely to rely on the central bank, as it has done in the past. The post-COVID economic turmoil was due to the inflationary actions of the Central Bank",
    "Conclusion: Learning to see the unseen",
    "The instinct to control prices and print money for reliefs addresses only the immediate, \u201cseen\u201d political problem while unleashing a cascade of \u201cunseen\u201d economic devastation. It repeats the error of the broken window, celebrating the glazier\u2019s work while forgetting the tailor\u2019s lost sale.",
    "The central bank mandate, as stated in the Monetary Law Act, is to ensure financial, economic and price stability. By any objective measure it has completely failed in its mandate. As per H\u00fclsmann\u2019s explanation, the cultural and societal costs of inflationary policy over the decades have hurt Sri Lankans profoundly.",
    "Globally, the role of central banks is being questioned, from the \u201cEnd the Fed\u201d movement in the US to Javier Milei\u2019s proposal in Argentina to abolish the central bank altogether.",
    "While politically challenging, the Government must consider empowering the market\u2019s knowledge system rather than attempting to override it. Controlling an economy\u2019s vast array of prices, goods, and services is an informationally impossible task for any central authority, as evidenced by economic history worldwide and the experience of developed nations.",
    "The focus should shift toward a disciplined consolidation of the Government\u2019s role. By focusing on its fundamental duties, i.e. upholding the rule of law, protecting property rights, and ensuring a stable monetary framework, the Government would create the conditions for a private-sector-led recovery.",
    "Such a framework of Government restraint would free capital, honour savers, and allow market prices to perform their vital role of allocating scarce resources efficiently. The unseen benefit would be a more resilient, adaptive, and prosperous society.",
    "Only by accounting for the full consequences of policy\u2014both seen and unseen\u2014can Sri Lanka build a foundation for genuine, resilient recovery from Ditwah and future prosperity.",
