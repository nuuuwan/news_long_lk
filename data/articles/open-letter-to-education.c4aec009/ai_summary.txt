🏫 The Ministry of Education has been informed by the Senior Deputy Principal of Royal College about teachers serving over 10 years. 
👨‍🏫 There are 49 teachers present at Royal College who should have been transferred out after completing 10 years at the school.
📈 Some teachers in the list have served for as long as 23 years and as short as 11 years.
📅 The policy of transferring teachers after serving 10 years in a school has been in place since 2017.
❓ The claims ask why Royal College is an exception to this rule and actions are not being taken. 
💰 Concerns were raised regarding money collections at Royal College that lack transparent records and receipts. 
🏦 These illicit funds are reportedly stored in private bank accounts for long periods without accountability or auditing.
👥 There is a suspicion that some senior teachers could be involved in these irregular activities.
💼 The query was addressed to the Ministry of Education to determine what action they will take regarding these issues.
