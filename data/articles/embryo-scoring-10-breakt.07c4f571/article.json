    "Many Americans agree that it\u2019s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it\u2019s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child\u2019s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) has been around in some form since the 1990s. And established tests, such as those for chromosomal abnormalities or single-\u00adgene disorders, are now becoming more accessible\u2014great news for would-be parents at risk of passing on a severe genetic disease.\u00a0  In the past few years, startups have begun offering a new form of the technology called PGT-P, or preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits). These are conditions and characteristics that arise out of interactions among hundreds or thousands of genetic variants. The resulting polygenic risk scores offer statistical probabilities that an embryo will develop, say, brown eyes or a high IQ or short stature, presenting potential parents with a way to sift through their \u201cbest embryos.\u201d A company called Genomic Prediction introduced the first clinical application of PGT-P back in 2019. It was followed a few years later by Orchid, which offered a more comprehensive type of sequencing. As they have commercialized, both companies have focused primarily on severe diseases. Then, in 2025, two new competitors\u2014Herasight and Nucleus Genomics\u2014started making bold claims about a wide range of characteristics they could screen for, including intelligence.

Some critics warn of eugenics, while others question the clinical utility of these scores. Even proponents acknowledge that they offer probabilities of somewhat limited significance, rather than certainties. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, where tech titans like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have supported companies offering it. Now it\u2019s becoming more widely available to everyone: Today, PGT-P is offered at over 100 fertility clinics in the US. This competition could drive down prices, expand availability, and improve the quality of all PGT services.\u00a0 202610 Breakthrough TechnologiesSodium-ion batteriesGenerative codingNext-gen nuclearAI companionsBase-edited babyGene resurrectionMechanistic interpretabilityCommercial space stationsEmbryo scoringHyperscale AI data centersReturn to the listhide"
