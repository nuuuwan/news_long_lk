AI Overviews, Google's new AI-powered search feature, provides brief AI-generated summaries of key information. However, the system has proven unreliable, giving out strange and false responses, for instance, it suggested that former US president Andrew Johnson earned university degrees between 1947 and 2012, despite dying in 1875. In response, Google stated it is making technical improvements to the system, like better detection mechanisms for nonsensical queries and limiting the inclusion of satirical content in responses. AI Overviews uses a language model that predicts the next word (or token) in a sequence, which is useful for fluent responses, but it can return incorrect information. The AI model gets around this issue by using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique that checks sources outside of its training data. However, the RAG system can return misleading answers if it encounters conflicting information and doesn't know which source to draw a response from. Google is working on refining this AI technology to improve the reliability and relevance of search results.
