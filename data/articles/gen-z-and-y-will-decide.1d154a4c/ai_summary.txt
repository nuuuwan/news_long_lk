Trends in Sri Lankan politics have recently hinted towards alliances and crossovers among political parties and politicians for the upcoming 2024 Presidential elections. However, the focus on these alliances may be misplaced, as voters, specifically the Gen Z and Gen Y groups, are more concerned with issues such as corruption, the environment, equal rights, and gender issues. Additionally, public trust towards politicians has weakened due to governance weaknesses and corruption scandals which have contributed to Sri Lanka's financial crisis. This lack of trust is further reinforced by the country's present difficulties, including the Covid-19 pandemic, civil unrest and escalating living costs. The younger generation, unaffiliated with political parties but accounting for two million potential votes, will play a pivotal role in the election. Experts suggest that politicians should focus on addressing these issues rather than investing in traditional political strategies like alliances and free handouts.
