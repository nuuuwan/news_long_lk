Facts:

- Performance Reviews (PRs), known as annual meetings in most corporate environments, assess the performance and achievement of employees against set goals.
- These reviews affect numerous aspects like incentive payments, salary increments, promotions, training, talent management, and succession planning.
- PRs should serve as a forum where supervisors and their reportees can discuss areas of improvement and success, leading to a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).
- For employees, PRs are seen as opportunities to highlight their efforts and feel a sense of belonging.
- PRs include continuous monitoring of Key Performance Goals (KPGs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which must be agreed upon by both the employee and the supervisor.
- The formal performance appraisal involves a Career Committee that includes the supervisor, persons familiar with the employeeâ€™s role deliverables, a representative from HR, and an observer/moderator.
- A normal PR process involves several steps such as agreeing the KPIs, constant feedback, mid-year and post year-end appraisal, and rating documentations among others.
- Performance review follow-up is essential as it helps to ensure that the feedback received translates into action, improvement, and growth.
