Facts presented:

- The three “Rio Conventions” drafted following the 1992 Earth Summit include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
- In the fourth quarter of 2024, all three of these conventions will hold their respective Conferences of the Parties in Colombia, Azerbaijan, and Saudi Arabia.
- Collaboration is considered crucial to achieving the conventions' respective targets and to simultaneously address the areas of climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and land degradation neutrality.
- Sri Lanka is participating in the Rio Conventions and has ratified and engaged significantly with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.
- The country has ratified the Biodiversity Convention and adopted its National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan. Sri Lanka is one of 36 global biodiversity hotspots due to a high level of endemic species of animals and plants across its diverse ecosystems.
- Finally, Sri Lanka ratified UNCCD in 1998 and submitted its latest country report in 2022.
- Food systems cut across all three Rio Conventions, and sustainable practices are essential for preventing land degradation and desertification, conserving agrobiodiversity, and ensuring long-term agricultural productivity and resilience to climate change.

Opinions expressed:

- The author believes that the ongoing global crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation, are all part of the “polycrisis” humanity is facing in the 21st Century, particularly impacting vulnerable developing countries like Sri Lanka.
- The author emphasizes the importance of collaboration among the Rio Conventions and suggests that maximizing synergies between them could help address multiple environmental challenges simultaneously.
- The author opines that restoring degraded ecosystems can provide a range of benefits including carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery, soil fertility improvement, and more. Similarly, transforming food systems can contribute to food security, climate resilience, and biodiversity conservation.
- Emphasis is put on the need for integrating scientific research into policymaking. In the author's view, specialized bodies like the IPCC, IPBES, and UNCCD Committee on Science and Technology play crucial roles in this process.
- The author suggests that coordinating existing financial mechanisms could optimize resource efficiency and direct funding towards projects promoting positive synergies across climate change, biodiversity, and land management.
- Lastly, the author concludes that 2024 is a pivotal year to align efforts towards integrated global environmental governance.
