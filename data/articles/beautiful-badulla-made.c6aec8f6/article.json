    "Although a gully bowser\u00a0 service is available for latrine clearance at a cost of around Rs.\u00a0 7,500, many residents choose to avoid this expense by illegally\u00a0 connecting their wastewater to the main drainage",
    "In Badulla, families in tea plantation communities struggle\u00a0 daily to obtain clean water and enjoy basic sanitation. Distant,\u00a0 unreliable water sources and poor infrastructure expose residents to\u00a0 frequent illnesses. The sad part of their story is that there is limited\u00a0 relief in sight for their woes. For women and children, who bear much\u00a0 of the burden, the absence of safe water and sanitation remains a harsh,\u00a0 ongoing reality.",
    "Organizations like The Future in Our Hands (FIOH) and\u00a0 Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) are working to raise awareness\u00a0 and bring government attention to these critical needs.",
    "The Future in Our Hands (FIOH) organization has\u00a0 collaborated with the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) to\u00a0 implement a project within the Badulla Municipal Council area. The\u00a0 initiative seeks to raise awareness on sanitation issues in several\u00a0 Grama Niladhari areas, including Kanupelella, Katupelella, Hindagoda,\u00a0 Badulupitiya and Sumanatissagama.",
    "The goal of the project is not to build sanitation\u00a0 facilities, but to empower locals and draw government attention to the\u00a0 ongoing problems.",
    "Subramaniam Thavaseelan, FIOH Project Manager,\u00a0 underscored that while the Badulla Municipal Council operates a sewage\u00a0 and wastewater treatment plant and offers gully service facilities,\u00a0 residents suspect that political interference affects their access to\u00a0 these services.",
    "This interference often complicates the government\u2019s efforts to provide consistent service to affected areas.",
    "Efforts by the community, council buckled",
    "Despite efforts by the Municipal Council to promote\u00a0 sanitation and hygiene, many residents remain resistant or unaware of\u00a0 these initiatives.",
    "Thavaseelan pointed out that some estate workers, many of\u00a0 whom had lived in Sri Lanka for over two centuries, still lack essential\u00a0 sanitation facilities.",
    "\u201cMuch of the sanitation problem stems from a lack of awareness and resident negligence,\u201d said Thavaseelan.",
    "\u201cSome avoid using the provided sanitation services and\u00a0 discharge wastewater into the environment instead. Unauthorised\u00a0 construction has obstructed drainage, and around 5% of estate residents\u00a0 lack proper toilets, with multiple families often forced to share a\u00a0 single facility,\u201d he said.",
    "The ugly sight of swerage in the area",
    "Concerns and environmental impact",
    "During the Daily Mirror\u2019s visit to Hindagoda and\u00a0 Badulupitiya, residents expressed concerns about sewage from nearby\u00a0 suburban areas flowing into the Karanda Canal.",
    "This pollution reaches the Badulu Oya, a tributary of the Mahaweli River, posing further health and environmental hazards.",
    "L.H. Premasiri, a resident of Viharagoda, spoke about a\u00a0 drainage system near Dharmadutha College that has been contaminated with\u00a0 sewage. He urged local authorities to construct a proper drainage\u00a0 system and prevent black water discharge. Although a gully bowser\u00a0 service is available for latrine clearance at a cost of around Rs.\u00a0 7,500, many residents choose to avoid this expense by illegally\u00a0 connecting their wastewater to the main drainage.",
    "Badulla Municipal Council Engineer Senthur Kumar explained\u00a0 the wastewater treatment process, which involves collecting sewage from\u00a0 both public and private systems around Badulla.",
    "The facility can treat only up to 50 cubic metres a day, although it currently processes around 30 cubic metres.",
    "Kumar noted that while there is no sewage pipeline\u00a0 in Badulla, a feasibility study was underway to install one in the\u00a0 town\u2019s congested areas.",
    "To encourage usage of the gully bowser service, the Municipal Council reduced the charge for private residents to Rs. 5,500.Thilekesiri,\u00a0 some residents add kerosene to sewage water before releasing it into\u00a0 the drainage system during a downpour. Political pressure has reportedly\u00a0 limited enforcement actions against such behaviour.",
    "However, according to the Chief Public Health Inspector (PHI) M.V",
    "During a visit by the Daily Mirror team to Queenstown\u00a0 Estate in Hali-Ela, representatives from FIOH and CEJ observed the dire\u00a0 sanitation conditions faced by estate workers.",
    "Due to limited land provided by estate owners, workers\u00a0 cannot independently construct their houses or personal sanitation\u00a0 facilities.",
    "The small plots allocated to workers often lack sufficient\u00a0 space for toilets, and building new ones requires permission from the\u00a0 estate owners.",
    "As a result, when a toilet is built, it must be shared by multiple families, increasing health risks.",
    "Additionally, estate workers do not have access to\u00a0 sanitation facilities while working in the field. The lack of proper\u00a0 facilities not only affects their health and hygiene, but also reflects\u00a0 the ongoing neglect these communities face in terms of basic services\u00a0 and infrastructure.",
    "To increase awareness of these issues, FIOH and CEJ\u00a0 organised a media tour led by FIOH\u2019s Thavaseelan and supported by Dilena\u00a0 Pathragoda, CEJ\u2019s Executive Director. Sponsored by the Diakonia Project\u00a0 under FANSA Sri Lanka, this tour enabled a close examination of the\u00a0 conditions faced by Badulla residents and plantation workers in the\u00a0 Hali Canal area.",
    "Addressing Badulla\u2019s sanitation crisis requires continuous\u00a0 advocacy, transparent government action, and sustained community\u00a0 engagement.",
    "By highlighting these challenges in the media and creating\u00a0 awareness, FIOH, CEJ, and the local authorities hope to provide clean\u00a0 water and make the accessibility of sanitation a reality for these\u00a0 long-overlooked communities."
