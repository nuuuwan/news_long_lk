    "Using the end of the summer to reset your approach to development can create new energy for your career. Instead of feeling like another thing to fit in, it can be a new source of motivation that supports everything else you\u2019re trying to do. The idea is to identify actions that will kick-start your learning in a way that\u2019s easy to add into your day. First, set a \u201cgrowth goal\u201d focused on the strengths you want to stretch or the skills you\u2019d like to learn. Second, connect with people who share your curiosity and interest in a specific topic. Third, do a five-day skill sprint. And finally, ask colleagues for feedback.",
