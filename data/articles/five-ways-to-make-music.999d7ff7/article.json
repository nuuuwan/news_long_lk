    "This story first appeared in China Report, MIT Technology Review\u2019s newsletter about technology in China.\u00a0Sign up\u00a0to receive it in your inbox every Tuesday. This week, we are taking a short break from China and turning to its neighbor South Korea instead. As K-pop sweeps the world and accumulates a massive, devout fan base, these fans have been turning their power into action. Today, I published a story about Kpop4planet, a group of volunteers who are using K-pop\u2019s influence to hold large corporations accountable for their carbon footprints.  One of the most interesting (and also successful) campaigns Kpop4planet has organized shines a light on the carbon footprint of music streaming. Aware that K-pop fans stream significantly more than average (sometimes over five hours a day!) to support their favorite artists, the group successfully campaigned to get Korea\u2019s largest domestic streaming platform to pledge to use 100% renewable energy by 2030. I have to admit, before working on this story, it didn\u2019t really cross my mind that streaming music could be so polluting. Streaming an album more than 27 times uses more energy than it takes to produce a CD, according to researchers, but it\u2019s surprisingly hard to draw a conclusive answer on whether streaming is more polluting than CDs or records overall. What we do know is that since the carbon emissions associated with streaming are produced in faraway data centers and through invisible data transmissions, the problem is harder to pin down.",
    "During my reporting, I talked to several experts about how to correctly understand the climate impact of music streaming, and one thing became clear: It all comes down to how we stream\u2014the content, the device, the length, etc. They also recommended a bunch of things that any music streaming user can do to leave a smaller carbon footprint. So here are the things you can do if you are a heavy music streamer:",
    "1. Use small devices instead of big TVs.\u00a0 A major part of streaming\u2019s carbon footprint comes from the device that\u2019s used to play the music or video. And some are much more power hungry than others. A 50-inch LED TV consumes 100 times more electricity than a smartphone when used for streaming, according to the International Energy Agency. It also consumes more electricity if the screen stays on, displaying videos or lyrics, rather than just playing the audio. So using a smartphone to stream cuts energy consumption to a minimum. 2. Wait longer to buy a new phone.\u00a0 Yes, smartphones are designed to be pretty energy-efficient to use, but manufacturing them is another story. \u201cIn the life-cycle analysis of a phone, 85% to 90% of its lifetime energy occurs in its production,\u201d says Laura Marks, a professor in media art and philosophy at Simon Fraser University. The manufacturing process usually involves fossil fuels, plastics, and minerals that could pollute the environment.  \u201cSo if I were to make a couple of recommendations, one of them would be to keep your devices for as long as possible, because that\u2019s a huge, huge component of streaming that\u2019s often overlooked,\u201d she says. 3. Return to digital downloads, and only use streaming in selected situations. While few people still download music files today, experts have agreed that one of the most climate-friendly ways to listen to music is to keep a digital file of your favorite song and return to it repeatedly.\u00a0 We also need to change our mindset about treating streaming as the only way to listen to music, says Joe Steinhardt, an assistant professor in the music industry program at Drexel University. \u201cThe first and the easiest [suggestion] is to think about streaming music like Styrofoam plates or plastic forks. It doesn\u2019t mean I never use those; it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t eat every meal off of them,\u201d he says. If you are listening to a large variety of music, maybe streaming is the best choice; if you are listening to a few songs repeatedly, go for a digital download or even an old-fashioned CD.",

    "4. Push for streaming platforms to do their part. Climate action is not just about individual responsibility\u2014it also means pushing corporations to do better. Just as Kpop4planet chased after Melon, Korea\u2019s largest domestic music streaming service, you can also hold your favorite music streaming service accountable.\u00a0 A big part of that is figuring out where the platforms\u2019 data centers are, as these can account for a third to a half of streaming\u2019s carbon footprint, according to Marks. These gigantic facilities draw significant amounts of electricity. If they can switch to using renewable energy, that will be much more meaningful than any action one individual can take. It\u2019s also important not to fall for empty promises, and to seek specific plans on where and how they plan to source renewable energy. 5. Cherish music and resist overconsumption.  Many experts mention the Jevons paradox, which states that increasing the efficiency with which a resource is used can lead to more total consumption. In the case of streaming, this means that even if the technology can become more energy-efficient on a per-song basis, the business model and the sheer convenience often encourage users to listen to more and more songs without considering the climate consequences. To resist that mindset, Marks suggests, we should cherish listening to music more. \u201cInstead of streaming all day, it could mean really enjoying the performance of a song\u2014just listening to it a couple of times and then talking with your friends about it,\u201d she says. My conclusion? It\u2019s never too late to become aware of the climate impact of music streaming and think about what we can do to make it even just a little greener.",

Tsingshan Holding Group, a Chinese steel and nickel company, was instrumental in investing in and setting up the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), where a rich local reserve of nickel ore is converted into high-purity nickel sulfate that\u2019s essential for electric vehicle batteries.\u00a0 IMIP has created at least 100,000 jobs and contributed significantly to Indonesia\u2019s economy, but it has also led to environmental and health challenges for local communities. Concerns about air and water pollution, garbage disposal, and worker safety have intensified following an explosion in 2023 that killed eight Chinese workers and 13 Indonesian workers. Now, local workers are organizing to sit down with management and push for changes in worker welfare. One more thing If you want a guaranteed sighting of a UFO, come to Shenzhen.
