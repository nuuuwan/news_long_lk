# Companies Need a New Approach to Investing This Election Year

## Summary ü§ñ

1. üìà During election years, policy uncertainty typically increases due to different views of opposing parties on economic policies affecting companies.
2. üéØ Uncertainty influences managerial decisions. Large investments are often postponed until after elections when the policy direction becomes clearer.
3. üí° Managers can utilize the period of uncertainly to undertake projects that entail minimal commitments like R&D, product testing and strategic partnerships. 
4. üîÑ The usual pattern of pre-election uncertainty fading post-election may not hold for the 2024 U.S. elections due to particular circumstances. 
5. üìâ Despite robust economic recovery post-pandemic, concerns are rising about the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio reaching alarming levels, a trend not unique to the U.S.
6. üí≥ The high debt burdens could pose risks for U.S. corporations such as political gridlock, government shutdowns, and a U.S. credit rating downgrade.
7. üí∞The Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the effects of inflation and interest rates could impact investment decisions in the run-up to elections.
8. üöß Political gridlock and government shutdowns, could affect businesses reliant on government infrastructure and funding.
9. üìä Political cycles have impact on equity valuation and cost of capital which companies planning to expand or engage in M&A activity need to consider.
10. üåø Policy uncertainty also pertains to green initiatives as they can be affected by changes in government after elections and potentially conflicting regulations across different jurisdictions.

In the U.S., it‚Äôs normal for policy uncertainty to increase before a major election, then decrease once the results are in. In any other election cycle, the predictable increase and decrease in uncertainty offers shrewd managers unique opportunities for operating,...more

Election years have long been characterized by increased policy uncertainty, which typically reverts to lower levels after the results become known. Opposing parties have different views on a gamut of economic policies that affect firms‚Äô growth, risks, and profitability. This pattern of uncertainty buildup followed by its sudden post-election decline has been observed at levels across the political spectrum, including U.S. gubernatorial and presidential elections as well as major elections around the globe.

But is 2024 comparable to other U.S. election years? Can we take for granted that economic and policy uncertainty will wind down after November?

Not necessarily. We believe there are a few unusual factors this time that could cause the usual pre-election uncertainty to persist after the results are in. Here‚Äôs what managers must keep in mind this year as they fine-tune their firms‚Äô strategies.

The Usual Election-Year Uncertainty Cycle

The increased uncertainty leading up to an election can restrain corporate investment decision-making. Conventional wisdom holds that managers should ideally pause or postpone large investments in physical assets (e.g., building a new plant) and human resources (hiring employees to support a large expansion). Thus, projects that require large financial commitments, whose scaling back and subsequent restructuring would impose substantial costs, should wait until after the election. For example, a Republican administration would likely be more favorable for coal mining and natural gas‚Äìliquification projects, whereas solar cell and EV‚Äìmanufacturing projects would likely fare better with a Democrat in the White House. Investing in these projects just before an election is not advised because the outcome may require costly divestments and reversals.

In any other election cycle, the predictable increase and decrease in uncertainty offers shrewd managers unique opportunities for operating, investment, and financing decisions. Election years are the time to pursue projects that entail minimal commitments and expenditures but will produce tremendous first-mover advantage and large payoffs if post-election policy turns out to be favorable ‚Äî for example, launching new products and brands in test markets, experimenting with product variants, trying pilot production projects, conducting R&D, hiring key scientists, bidding for licenses and grants, and initiating dialogues with strategic partners.

Hence, the guideline for corporate decision-making in a typical election year is clear: Postpone projects that require large commitments in capital and labor and undertake low-commitment experiments that can be scaled quickly if the policy outcome is favorable. This year, however, there are additional considerations for managers.

What‚Äôs Different This Time?

The post-pandemic economic recovery in the U.S. has been unquestionably impressive, dwarfing the rebounds of its peer economies. The 2022 inflationary shock seems to be gradually receding, unemployment rates are near historic lows, and GDP figures have returned to pre-pandemic trends.

Despite the positive economic outlook, several economists have voiced concerns that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio has reached alarming levels. This situation didn‚Äôt occur in a random or arbitrary fashion ‚Äî debt-to-GDP ratios have been increasing in most developed countries as the result of aging populations increasing the burden of pension and social security costs. Furthermore, rising social inequality makes voters demand government spending to financially support programs tailored to addressing their basic needs. This trend was magnified by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the U.S. and other countries to put forth massive fiscal stimuli.

The elevated debt burdens are factually troublesome, and they impose real risks for U.S. corporations ‚Äî for example, elevated threats of political gridlock, government shutdowns, and a U.S. credit rating downgrade ‚Äî irrespective of which party wins, as the trend of widening deficits goes beyond partisan lines.

Planning for a Unique Election Year

In short, regardless of the election outcome, many fiscal challenges lie ahead, and solutions to the problem are far from clear. Considering the uniqueness of the 2024 election cycle, managers must take the following factors into account when planning investment decisions:

Whether monetary policy uncertainty will subside after November.

The pandemic forced the Fed to engage in quantitative easing policies to prevent financial turmoil. Subsequently, global inflationary pressure has forced the Fed to maintain high interest rates. However, because of its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed must also attempt to prevent a recession. Whether it will achieve a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù ‚Äî and whether the economy will be able to accommodate interest rate cuts without causing a new inflation surge ‚Äî remains to be seen. Managers should not overlook the effects of monetary policy decisions on the U.S. government‚Äôs debt burden. Elevated rates increase the government‚Äôs cost of servicing its sovereign debt, which further amplifies fiscal policy uncertainty.

How interest rates and credit availability affect your business.

The consumer goods, housing construction, and automobile sectors, all of which rely on a buy-now-pay-later business model, are extremely sensitive to interest costs, as consumers primarily consider monthly debt-servicing obligations when making their purchasing decisions.

How political gridlock and government shutdowns affect your business.

Businesses that rely on government infrastructure, such as airlines and tourism, and organizations that serve customers based on government funding, such as state capitals and national parks, are highly vulnerable to these credit events.

How much your organization depends on government policies.

Each gridlock and its subsequent compromise has the potential to change government policies related to taxation and duties, import restrictions, government subsidies, mining rights, and resource availability. Managers must evaluate their dependence on such policies in terms of how they affect their firm‚Äôs profitability and growth. For example, firms that rely on government business, such as those in the defense sector, and those that rely on government subsidies, such as semiconductor fabs, are vulnerable to sudden shifts in government priorities and policies.

How political cycles affect equity valuation and cost of capital.

Stock markets are at historic highs; however, that‚Äôs driven largely by a handful of tech giants whose valuations have reached unprecedented levels. At the aggregate level, stock markets seem highly calm and stable, but there is an undercurrent of extreme instability at the individual stock level, and many stocks haven‚Äôt recovered since the Covid pandemic. Firms planning to approach public equity markets for their growth and expansion plans or to conduct M&A activity must pay attention to these developments.

How partisanship will affect green initiatives.

Firms across the world have initiated green initiatives to respond to their investor and customer demands ‚Äî and they‚Äôre likely to face stop-and-go maneuvers. For example, the SEC recently issued new regulations for climate-related risk disclosures in annual reports. The ruling has been challenged in multiple courts and is now in a stalemate pending their adjudication.

In addition, firms could face conflicting regulations. For example, California has its own emission standards and climate risk-disclosure requirements for businesses operating in the state, which could conflict with federal requirements, making it difficult for companies to comply. This policy uncertainty has broad economic implications, especially if other jurisdictions expect more stringent emission requirements.

Finally, the outcome of the presidential election could upend the United States‚Äô position regarding the Paris Agreement. Eventual policy disagreements between the U.S. and other countries may affect the marketability of U.S. export products.

Policy uncertainty in election years is a matter of fact. In a typical election year, the uncertainty abates after the election, and managers must plan their investment decisions to exploit this uncertainty cycle. Nevertheless, this year may be different, and managers need to be ready for continued uncertainty post-election.
