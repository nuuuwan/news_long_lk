Most professionals understand the value of networking; the problem is that they just don’t do it enough. That’s why “networking more” — especially in the form of joining new professional groups or associations — is such a popular new year’s resolution.

But, especially for introverts, the reality of plunging into a pack of strangers at an event can feel profoundly intimidating. It’s bad enough when everyone is relatively new to the group. But it’s even worse when you discover that you’re practically the only new member and everyone else already seems to know each other. How can you break in and build relationships when no one else seems to feel the need?

No matter how prestigious or coveted the membership may be, it can be tempting to bolt. Here are four strategies to help you feel more comfortable, so you can stick around long enough to enjoy yourself — and the benefits of membership.

Ask for networking help.

In most cases, you’ll know at least one person in the group who can help you break in — even if it’s the group’s membership coordinator who approved you. They can provide background information and context about group mores and how the “players” relate to each other. They can also help with introductions and other “wingman” activities, such as helping “talk you up” when you’re first meeting others.

Remember, not every contact is attuned enough to realize you’ll feel uncomfortable at first; they may simply assume you’ll be fine on your own. That’s why it’s important to ask specifically for their help — which they’ll almost certainly be glad to provide. “Because I’m new here,” you could say, “I’m not really sure who to talk with. Would you mind pointing out the folks you think I ought to know, and introducing us?”

Commit to understanding the dynamics of the group.

A while back, I helped a client become a member of an elite professional association. Partway through his first event, I found him standing by himself, looking miserable. “How are you liking it?” I asked. “I’m not sure if these are my people,” he said. And of course they weren’t — yet. When you’re first meeting new contacts, your conversation will almost always be basic and filled with small talk, as you figure out who’s who and learn how things work in that group. Meanwhile, you’re watching longtime members have fun and “go deep” with each other, and the juxtaposition may feel jarring.

But you can’t make an informed analysis at your first meeting, or even your first few. Instead, reserve judgment and, like an anthropologist, commit to understanding the dynamics of this new group. During the moments when it seems uncomfortable, remind yourself why you joined in the first place (access to interesting, high-level people, or an opportunity to make connections in a new field, for instance). Five years later, my client is now one of the most involved and well-connected members in that group.

Overindex during your first year.

Because you’ll feel like a stranger at first (and you are) the antidote is to make yourself a “regular” as quickly as possible. Prioritize attending the new group’s events — even to an extreme, as I did when I signed up to attend four consecutive Renaissance Weekend conferences (without even having attended my first). The initial gathering was indeed uncomfortable, as I forced myself to network with hundreds of strangers. But within a couple of sessions, I knew so many attendees, I had become a connector.

You can also take advantage of virtual ways to deepen your connection to a given community, such as participating in online forums or setting up one-on-one “getting to know you” video calls with other members.

Double-check your assumptions.

When you’re first making sense of a new social dynamic, it’s easy to overlay your “standard script” onto the circumstances. One colleague of mine was recently bemoaning the high level of “status consciousness” in a group we both belong to. When I asked why he felt that way, he said it seemed clear that the more “famous” members of the group all hung out together — which was true. But it was also true that they were longstanding members who knew each other well.

It’s possible that they only wanted to hang out with other “elites,” I acknowledged. But I reminded him it was equally possible that they just wanted to catch up with their friends, and once he got to know them, he would be in that category as well. It’s worth stress-testing your perspective with trusted friends and colleagues before settling on a judgment, especially a negative one.

Even for experienced professionals, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to enter a social situation in which it seems like everyone else knows one another, while you’re making stilted small talk with an endless sea of strangers. But by following these strategies, before long, you can transform those new contacts into valued colleagues and friends.
