    "Even for experienced professionals, it can feel intimidating to join a new professional group or association \u2014 especially if you discover that you\u2019re practically the only new member and everyone else already seems to know each other. How can you break in...more",
    "Most professionals understand the value of networking; the problem is that they just don\u2019t do it enough. That\u2019s why \u201cnetworking more\u201d \u2014 especially in the form of joining new professional groups or associations \u2014 is such a popular new year\u2019s resolution.",
    "But, especially for introverts, the reality of plunging into a pack of strangers at an event can feel profoundly intimidating. It\u2019s bad enough when everyone is relatively new to the group. But it\u2019s even worse when you discover that you\u2019re practically the only new member and everyone else already seems to know each other. How can you break in and build relationships when no one else seems to feel the need?",
    "No matter how prestigious or coveted the membership may be, it can be tempting to bolt. Here are four strategies to help you feel more comfortable, so you can stick around long enough to enjoy yourself \u2014 and the benefits of membership.",
    "Ask for networking help.",
    "In most cases, you\u2019ll know at least one person in the group who can help you break in \u2014 even if it\u2019s the group\u2019s membership coordinator who approved you. They can provide background information and context about group mores and how the \u201cplayers\u201d relate to each other. They can also help with introductions and other \u201cwingman\u201d activities, such as helping \u201ctalk you up\u201d when you\u2019re first meeting others.",
    "Remember, not every contact is attuned enough to realize you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable at first; they may simply assume you\u2019ll be fine on your own. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to ask specifically for their help \u2014 which they\u2019ll almost certainly be glad to provide. \u201cBecause I\u2019m new here,\u201d you could say, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure who to talk with. Would you mind pointing out the folks you think I ought to know, and introducing us?\u201d",
    "Commit to understanding the dynamics of the group.",
    "A while back, I helped a client become a member of an elite professional association. Partway through his first event, I found him standing by himself, looking miserable. \u201cHow are you liking it?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if these are my people,\u201d he said. And of course they weren\u2019t \u2014 yet. When you\u2019re first meeting new contacts, your conversation will almost always be basic and filled with small talk, as you figure out who\u2019s who and learn how things work in that group. Meanwhile, you\u2019re watching longtime members have fun and \u201cgo deep\u201d with each other, and the juxtaposition may feel jarring.",
    "But you can\u2019t make an informed analysis at your first meeting, or even your first few. Instead, reserve judgment and, like an anthropologist, commit to understanding the dynamics of this new group. During the moments when it seems uncomfortable, remind yourself why you joined in the first place (access to interesting, high-level people, or an opportunity to make connections in a new field, for instance). Five years later, my client is now one of the most involved and well-connected members in that group.",
    "Overindex during your first year.",
    "Because you\u2019ll feel like a stranger at first (and you are) the antidote is to make yourself a \u201cregular\u201d as quickly as possible. Prioritize attending the new group\u2019s events \u2014 even to an extreme, as I did when I signed up to attend four consecutive Renaissance Weekend conferences (without even having attended my first). The initial gathering was indeed uncomfortable, as I forced myself to network with hundreds of strangers. But within a couple of sessions, I knew so many attendees, I had become a connector.",
    "You can also take advantage of virtual ways to deepen your connection to a given community, such as participating in online forums or setting up one-on-one \u201cgetting to know you\u201d video calls with other members.",
    "Double-check your assumptions.",
    "When you\u2019re first making sense of a new social dynamic, it\u2019s easy to overlay your \u201cstandard script\u201d onto the circumstances. One colleague of mine was recently bemoaning the high level of \u201cstatus consciousness\u201d in a group we both belong to. When I asked why he felt that way, he said it seemed clear that the more \u201cfamous\u201d members of the group all hung out together \u2014 which was true. But it was also true that they were longstanding members who knew each other well.",
    "It\u2019s possible that they only wanted to hang out with other \u201celites,\u201d I acknowledged. But I reminded him it was equally possible that they just wanted to catch up with their friends, and once he got to know them, he would be in that category as well. It\u2019s worth stress-testing your perspective with trusted friends and colleagues before settling on a judgment, especially a negative one.",
    "Even for experienced professionals, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to enter a social situation in which it seems like everyone else knows one another, while you\u2019re making stilted small talk with an endless sea of strangers. But by following these strategies, before long, you can transform those new contacts into valued colleagues and friends.",
